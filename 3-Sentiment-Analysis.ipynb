    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the sentiment of the various transcripts, both overall and throughout the comedy routine."

       "[['what an excellent film by rian johnson  definitely feels like the film he was destined to make  writing that is slick as hell  sublime performances  most notably daniel craig who brings his a game in a wonderfully charismatic turn   superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music   all tied together by masterful direction  will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of agatha christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here   a nostalgically entertaining time  nothing was typical about this  everything was beautifully done in this movie  the story  the flow  the scenario  everything i highly recommend it for mystery lovers  for anyone who wants to watch a good movie  this is a movie one would not regret spending money on  after a long time i am rating a movie perfect   and this movie totally deserves it  i really like the subtle comedy sprinkled in the movie  it easies out the tense atmosphere  in a good detective movie  you expect to be taken aback on how things unfold at the end and this is what happens in this movie  there is never an instant when you would get distracted or bored  i had a good time watching this movie and you would surely have it too  with the exception of my wife and daughter  and possibly my mother  agatha christie is the woman whom i love most on this planet  she truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived  and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays  more than forty years after she passed away  there are still many adaptations of her original work  but with  knives out   writer director rian johnson attempts something entirely different  it has   it is abundantly clear that johnson was inspired by all of christie s typical trademarks and hobby horses  and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings  but the plot of  knives out  is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen  a good old fashioned murder mystery whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family  full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets  convoluted plot twists  continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along  and a fabulous all knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues daniel craig is downright terrific as benoit blanc  a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one liners  hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch harlan thrombey  it looks like suicide  but literally every greedy member of harlan s bloodline had a motive for killing and   also in delightful agatha christie tradition   the plot even thickens after the reading of the will  it would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot  but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive  compelling as well as humorous  complex but simultaneously light headed and    entertaining  the cast is phenomenal  craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his james bond character  and the thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents  including jamie lee curtis  michael shannon  toni colette  christopher plummer and don johnson   knives out  is perhaps slightly too long  but never tedious  and very well directed by rian johnson  who honestly does not deserve all this hatred from disappointed  star wars  geeks  as a fan of mysteries  sherlock holmes  poirot  columbo  monk  psych etc   i was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit   and the cast  figure you cannot go wrong  well i enjoyed it   while the cast all have time to shine it is daniel craig with his southern drawl   especially ana de armas that steal the show  for anyone keeping away because they hated the last jedi   i agree  it was my least favourite of all the star wars films  but this is a well written film that was well acted and i can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre  best movie of the year  love everything about it  what I am seeing is that some trolls that still cannot get over tlj  now for those that have and give it a   well that has   that is fair but have some reasons why  not just bc it has   it is rian johnson  like stop it has   it is childish i enjoyed this a lot  clever  interesting and plausible in its logic  i enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters  i can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut some people might hate the politics of it  but i thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal  fox watchers will hate it  which i can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews what can also fuel the negative reviews  is all the positive hype about it  too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes  viewers go into the theater expecting too much things never live up to the hype and this one did not live up to it for me  but i thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining  I am not sorry i spent some money on this one  let me start by saying that the film is good  it has   it is a solid murder mystery and I shall   I will make sure i watch knives out   when it comes out  all i kept hearing about this film was that it was hilarious and brilliant and  so damn good  etc etc etc  i usually take these sorts of reactions with a grain of salt but  having seen the trailer and seeing how great the cast was  i bought into the hype  it looked so stylish  so compelling i really got my hopes up  and i cannot help thinking i would have enjoyed the film far more if i had not been inundated with so many reviews heralding it as some brilliant masterpiece i was expecting a lot of laughs and whilst i did laugh on occasion  i did not laugh nearly as much as i was hoping i would  a film like this would have benefited from some black humor  maybe rian could have co written the film wish a british comedy writer for some more quality laughs    phoebe waller bridge  perhaps  i enjoyed the scenes when the whole family was together and interacting with each other and i wish the film spent more time on them instead of opting for that ridiculous car chase and several other scenes that took me out of the whodunnit atmosphere overall  this film is a solid good time  entertaining  clever and well acted and written but  in my opinion  definitely does not live up to the hype  i have read the many glowing reviews for this film and i honestly do not get it  yes  there were some very funny and entertaining parts  it was a very good ensemble cast  daneil craig does his best kevin spacey as frank underwood impression  but beyond that  i found the cast woefully underused  jamie lee curtis  don johnson etc  i expected jamie lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing  she also  as the daughter  appeared to have no real motive for the murder  so the real crime here was her underuse      of the members of the family had no motive mentioned  then  when the  murder  was revealed at the half way point  it was clear martha did not really do it and was being set up  chris evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines  so the reveal  for the most part is painfuly obvious  or at least most of it  the give aways were pretty obvious  like granny saying  random  you are back again  or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people  the mention of the  slayer  law was very  very obvious  i understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but should not there be at least some surprises nor do i believe this is a  commentary  on our situation today  yes  there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here that is not to say it is a bad film  daniel craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball  lots of kooky things happened  but i think this is better for a late nite netflix watch i certainly do not see it as being  best of the year   i went into this film with high expectations to say the least  i had heard so many good things about it  so it was built up in my mind as this phenomenal murder mystery movie  but it fell short  where do i begin  daniel craig has this southern accent that just does not come across as convincing  not annoying  but not convincing  the main character of the film  marta  potrayed by ana de armas  has this very unbelievable physiological condition in which she vomits every time that she tells a lie  i mean  come on people  this vomiting  tool  is used multiple times throughout the film to figure out the truth about some of the other characters in the story  let us just say that she vomits excessively until the credits start to roll now  the part of this film that really upset me was the  big reveal  at the end  it is revealed at the end that detective benoit blanc knew about the blood stain on marta s shoe the whole time  the biggest issue with this reveal is why he did not ask her about it  he would have known her involvment in the murder the whole time  why did not he get the blood spot on her shoe tested  that would have easily put her in the room with harlan when he died overall  the movie was entertaining up until we are revealed what happened between marta and harlan  once i found out how harlan died  i started to lose interest  it basically lost the  mystery  quality once that happened  the story went flat after that but then took off when new developments started to happen  the reason i give this movie a     is because i was able to figure out things about the story right away  which left me disappointed  and the blood spot made me question a majority of the movie  it was not a bad watch  but i do not think i will be watching it again  being a middle aged englishman I have been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I have been spoilt  when the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story  i was very excited  having read the reviews  that seemingly in the case of  knives out  i would be getting a rare trinity of a good story  good actors and good production  it certainly has two of the three  unfortunately this film thinks it has   it is cleverer than it is  it has   it is simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together  rian johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming  i am woke  at the top of his lu',\n",
       "  'ngs at anybody who shall   who will listen  unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story  you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything  with this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you had   you would not be any less aware of what has   what is happening  a bit of a shame really  I am a mystery lover and have seen and read every agatha christie tale  i found this movie very slow for the first half  second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit  nor the charm and period atmosphere of a poirot episode  which i can watch over and over   thank you david suchet and the other main actors   the lead actress was very attractive  but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch  as well as ridiculously unbelievable  i guess that was the funny part    some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather beaten  did not like the sucking on cigars constantly  the last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid fire conclusion thank the lord  agree that daniel craig with that southern accent was just super annoying  great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat  over and over  it moved pretty slowly for me at times  i guess I am in a minority on this one  I am not saying it was terrible but it was not a great movie for me  mildly entertaining with a great cast and high production value  the story is soft but not awful  i cannot imagine saying this film deserves more than a    knives out uses a really old idea  the  whodunit   unfortunately  contrary to what many claim  there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern  except some hipster dialogue and humor  including a lot of throwing up by a specific character  and some commentary on current social issues  like the immigrant crisis  and pointing fingers at the ultra rich  which is ironic because the writer director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in hollywood  the writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas  in reality there not much cleverness here  while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard  and comes across as very pretentious and smugish  most of the humor falls completely flat  it is overlong    minutes   twists are not surprising and do not really make sense  only bright spots  daniel craig s amusing performance and the very talented ana de armas  other than that  a semi entertaining  mediocre and ultimate forgettable film  a perfect example of an uninspired writer director  with a complete lack of originality  who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least personally i do not know much about star wars as i do not really follow pop corn franchises  so i do not know what has   what is going on with this director and star wars  however  it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house  getting so much marketing hype and buzz  while hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its  director  looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious oscar contender for multiple awards  while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls     etc  I am confused  i say it has   it is nothing special and I am not a star wars fanatic  I have never even seen the film people are so angry about  so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film  knives out i definitely expected more  if it has   it is meant to be amusing  it pretty much failed on that score  this film would be better suited as a tv movie  if they even make them anymore  or something to pop up on netflix  i did not pay to see it and I had   I would feel I had   I would wasted my money if i had visually it was enjoyable i mean the location  the house  the production values  the family members were an unattractive bunch  so nothing to look at there  daniel craig s  southern  accent became grating after awhile  and i was squirming a bit with boredom  waiting for it to be over  and  when it was  my reaction was  so what  who cares   i can hardly remember any of it and i just watched it in the last couple of hours convoluted  unrealistic and tedious  like a lot of agatha christie stories  how this has ended up on some people s best films of   lists is beyond me  it was okay  nothing special  knives out       🗡🚪💉💸 rian johnson successfully revives the  whodunnit  mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time  even if it does not bring anything groundbreaking to the table  knives out is the kind of  whodunnit  film that will never fail to entertain  as a progressive mystery  knives out is a very fashionable movie with it has   it is grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces  with some very snarky and slick writing  these characters are albeit memorable  most notably daniel craig s detective blanc and chris evan s ransome  however  the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent  of course that never takes away from what else knives out has to offer  the intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion  one could say murder on the orient express had a beautiful baby  this being the result  showing rian johnson s strongholds  while the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising  the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it has   it is footing upon the conclusion  one for all and all for one verdict  knives out not only proves to us that rian johnson is a strong director with the right material  but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways  general reviewgoing in  i was expecting an energetic edgar wright feel  and complex sherlock holmes mystery in which the audience tries to solve it at the same time  what i got was a cookie cutter  mystery  that was different from others in its genre only in its use of bright colours  rather than any sort of trope and convention subversion or parody spoiler timein regards to acting  christopher plummer  ana de armas and chris evans gave great performances    complaints for the main    i thoroughly enjoyed harlan and marta s scenes  there are more than   members of the cast  of which i have complaints  jamie lee curtis and micheal shannon among others gave performances that seemed to change personalities every few lines  probably due to rian johnson s directing  don johnson was good  lakeith stanfield was not  others were mediocre or just less special daniel craig section  daniel daniel daniel  what was that  the screenplay reads  blanc     speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have ever heard in your life   that is not what i was forced to listen to  the accent was very distracting and i could only hope for a case of stockholm syndrome that never came  his character was meant to act as an absurdist archetype satire of the noir detective  but instead he came across as an annoying detective who did not diverge from the archetypal role  if that did not bother you then it would have been a good performanceas mentioned i was expecting more edgar wright esque editing and cinematography that the trailer promised me overall  the writing is very basic  being a typical murder mystery  i am unsure if you can even call it a murder mystery when you find out the truth a quarter through  throughout the story  there were many setups with minimal or no payoff  e g  shoe blood  where is marta from  harlan should have commented to ransom during their fight where she is from   there were also too many inconsistencies  like how the stairs did not actually make a noise every time  some people went up with a noise and down without because rian johnson forgot for the final reveal  marta must be especially talented to feel  tincture and viscosity  of vials  a quality you might be able to feel when you are drawing a syringe  but she had made the choice already which solution to use  maybe density or weight would be acceptable but the given explanation of her being such a good person that her vail choice was correct is pretty dumb  also  the shots for fran s last words were different  where she said  you did this  in the scene and first flashback  but  hugh did this  in the last  these   issues detract from the fun of watching murder mysteries  in which an audience should be able to find the killer if they have been paying attention  instead the script pretended like you should have known these facts the suspect game instead was played by cast knowledge  by looking at the cast you can see it has   it is either jamie lee curtis  micheal shannon or chris evans  personally i guessed micheal shannon due to his typecasting  but when i realised that all   of harlan s children where the same character  with different jobs  it was then obviously the built up character named ransom  ransom  his name is ransom this leads me to one of my main critiques  unnecessary characters  despite all   of harlan s children being the same  the  nazi kid  served   purpose that could have easily been delivered by another character  the granddaughter  katherine langford served a whopping   purposes that all together could have been dropped and exchanged  there were   cops and blanc for some reason  of which the comedic policeman was not funny lastly  too many convenient devices like the stairs that made a noise  every time   marta vomiting when she lies  the dogs choosing to like and dislike people  or the various murder mystery cliches that excuse themselves through being self aware  secret doors and prop knives  i actually wish  would do away with the star rating portion of their website because it does not give an accurate rating for films and this film is a perfect example  everyone knows that there are many bitter star wars fanboys rating this film low because they are still so bitter over rian johnson s the last jedi and as a result  they are going to try to ruin any of rian s future films  they really need to just get over it and get a life  already  do not believe the star rating of this film because it has   it is mostly from bitter star wars fanboys rating the film low on purpose   obviously  anyone who has actually seen this film would be brain dead to rate it low or to not give it a good review because this film ',\n",
       "  'is so freaking entertaining  i could see it again and again  it has   it is so different than the crap that has been in the theaters lately  it has   it is fun  it has   it is thrilling  it has   it is wacky  it has so many twists and turns that it always keeps you guessing  and for the cast  what a freaking cast  i could not even tell you who the mvp of the cast was  they were all fantastic  we need more films like this and less big explosions  stupid plot films  i for one  will give this the true star rating it deserves           bitter star wars fanboys  you can keep being immature and rating it low  but it is not going to change the fact that the film is great and I am going to encourage every single person to go out and see it pronto when it hits theaters  generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery tv shows than movies  this is partially since it has   it is hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time this movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects  it has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details mid movie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute the acting was brilliant and i did not feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage  have to say i was a little disappointed by this  not because it is not good  arguably it is  but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good  which it is not  so as with so many films your experience   enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you overall i think nearly everyone will enjoy this  particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated cgi  having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of hollywood  one of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath  but not always beneath  the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it has   it is difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie  which without giving too much away it ultimately does what is genuinely enjoyable is daniel craig s slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match  the rest of the cast features some big names  but unfortunately as others have pointed out they do not always have that much to do  jamie lee curtis and toni collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is don johnson the plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all  and while it has   it is quite good  it is not that good or that original  the key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable  for the record i did not work out who did it  but did work out the mechanism involved   if one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement knives out falls somewhat short  a part of the problem is that for much of the film it is not clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place  in the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister perhaps the best aspect of the film  aside of daniel craig  was the fact that the johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy   the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller  I shall   I will probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I had   I would have to say i probably enjoyed adam sandler   jennifer aniston s murder mystery more than this  including with regard to the solution  knives out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it   or anyone else I had   I would venture   thinks it is  still enjoyable though really boring for the most time  lots of wasted potential  i do not understand the nomination and positve reviews  it has   it is just an ok movie  a missed opportunity to do something better  the movie plays like the worst episode of columbo you have ever seen  only this time it features daniel craig attempting to imitate foghorn leghorn  learn from my mistake and avoid this turkey  others have mentioned the old house might have held some secrets  it did not   or that it might present a more structured  whodunit  that leaves you guessing  it did not   or that the main character might offer a bit of verve  cleverness or pizazz  that might have livened up the whole affair  she does not  at all  i also take some issue with the director s choices in scene framing  especially in the beginning  there should have been more close ups  and better initial intros for each character s little idiosyncrasies so we would could warm up to them  i simply do not care for how it was shot  it has   it is terribly pedestrian  the fast  quick edits of the trailer are totally absent  there has   there is something missing here  todd solondz  tim burton or the cohen brothers really could have drawn these characters out more and given the actors something real to work with i thought it would sparkle with a bit more witty  dark humor  it was not quite as funny or snappy as i was expecting it to be  instead  it settles on delivering more of a  message  about this girl  who does good  while the others do bad there has   there is also no need for daniel craig s poor southern accent  he should have just done a british accent  it would have been fine and enjoyable  maybe given the film a bit more weight it seems it was shooting for  in the end  with its messaging additional viewings might reveal there has   there is more to it  but i suspect such might reveal there has   there is less  a stella cast carrying a whodunit will depend entirely on the story    sadly  instead of  the plot thickens   it thins out unbearably   overall the movie was entertaining enough to watch    but the plot was stretched a little thin and the ending was disappointing   a whodunit works by bringing the audience along to try to figure out the crime and be pleasantly surprised at the big reveal    this movie decided at the half way point that it no longer wants to be a whodunit and we no longer should follow along as it does its own thing    sigh   i would not recommend this to anyone who truly enjoy the genre  spoiler alert   let us tackle the minor annoyances first      the beginning sets everyone out as having a motive to murder    standard for the genre but here  it stops there   no building up of everyone anyone who also had the opportunity to commit the murder    motive without opportunity does not add up to murder   this means    before the middle of the story  we have already eliminated almost everyone as the suspect    which kinda defeats the whodunit plotline      having a girl who is a witness who vomits if she lies is extremely convenient for a murder detective    and    surely any investigator will target her for as much information as possible   here however  to preserve the big reveal later i guess  they let her off without ever really questioning her    even ransom got more information than the investigators did    in fact  the detectives were more interested in talking to benoit and kept telling her to go away after finding out this rather beneficial condition   this leaves a feeling of a weak plot that cannot exclude her from some crucial events   she did not have to witness the suicide    which in itself did not add anything to the story    and with that  she could spill the beans on what she did and we can all still believe there was further foul play involved      marta and benoit find the hidden tox report after spending hours to chase it down    yet they can sit down to have a chat after finding it but neither even opened it to take a look this gives us the scene where she was about to confess in front of the whole family but was stopped in mid sentence    drama    that has   that is ridiculous and again feels forced false      walt confronts marta at her home    he evades the horde of reporters and came in via the back way   firstly  a rich guy like him would likely never have to use the back way and would not be able to find one   secondly  walt is the  boss  of a printing empire and it has   it is unreasonable that nobody in the media recognises him   thirdly  he walks limps with a cane   is he really the best person to go seek marta out under the circumstance would not meg  donna or jacob be better suited for the stealth required mission    captain frigging america    emm  i mean ransom    when he left and came back  would not that be recorded in the early part of the surveillance video  he stopped exactly where she stopped   ok  this one  maybe i can accept the reason is he knows the area well and was able to evade detection    still unsatisfying though      fran wants to confront ransom believing he killed harlan   a woman  confronting a man killer even if he has   he is not captain america  surely would not choose an abandoned creepy location to meet  what does she think will happen  this is not a slasher flick where dumb teenagers go into the room despite multiple warnings not to      harlan was in a terrible rush to kill himself   marta explained that he will die in  minutes    and at around the   minutes mark  he will sweat profusely and have some other symptoms   would not a normal person wait until the symptoms start to show before reaching for the knife many more minor niggles like benoit not needing to introduce himself before sitting inside the house witnessing all the  interrogations      there seem to be no other maids or servants in such a huge  well maintained house  that needed to be questioned     marta just happens to have a large magnet in her pocket for erasing a video tape     nobody who was not around needs to have an alibi for their whereabouts    none of the other detectives see the blood stain on marta s shoe   too many roll eyes moments for a whodunit plot   now   let us get to the parts that killed the movie story      benoit doing his best poirot    and gave too much details without any evidence   examples    he could simply say ransom switched the medication   but instead  he goes into details of how he sucked out medication from ',\n",
       "  'one bottle and then from the other bottle    how would he know that  how did he deduce that it was ransom who sent him the cash  how can he be so sure that a person with dementia simply did not mix up  back  and  back again     very thin even if we can accept the inference   if he has   he is wrong at any point  ransom could stop him and the story telling ends   these plus some other details he brought up without any evidence shows that he is just showboating and not very professional    he should be more mindful of his reputation    and this goes against his persona of being careful with what he says as shown in the beginning      the claim is that ransom torched the examiners  office the night before    and yet in the morning light  actually around   already     and the fire on that not large building seem to just get going    in real life  it should be ashes before daylight    unless it was touched an hour or two before     since ransom was with marta in the morning  he could not have done it      we were told that overdose of morphine means dying in   minutes   when marta found fran  ransom was in police custody and there was nobody else around    she should be the prime suspect   and obviously  ransom could not have done that too      in the scene where she makes her escape after the will reading   the family could not stop her if she wanted to drive away    richard said something like  what do you want me to do  bite the bumper  to stop her leaving        but when she came out of the car  push through the crowd to get into ransom s car  not a single person stopped her getting in   this is of course essential for her to spend quality time with ransom    totally unrealistic   in conclusion   as said    not bad entertainment       but a terrible whodunit          so around     overall    this movie has an identity crisis  it cannot decide if it has   it is a thriller  mystery  drama  comedy or romance  as a result  it has   it is somewhat of a mess and difficult to sit through  it has   it is a shame because the acting is really good  the script just cannot keep up  both the male and female leads were superb  very talented actors who have huge careers ahead of them  the film was okay  his character was interesting  but the way he filmed guests was a little unbelievable and did not make sense  but i could ride with that  the story was a gentle run but with nothing of note to remember  i probably would not watch it again but i will be keen to see both the actors in something new  i recommend this film for a relaxed afternoon  oh  and i think helen hunt is in it  or someone who looks a bit like her  it has   it is rare you i find a movie i watch all through  let alone recommend to anyone  with that in mind  if you want to see a movie that is well acted  has a story that keeps your interest  is not predictable and has twists in the tale  you will find this worth a watch as a minimum  this one is a head scratcher    and by head scratcher i mean after the film is over you will scratch your head wondering why anyone would sign onto this movie  to say that the story was poorly conceived would be a an understatement  the movie goes absolutely no where and ultimately you are left with a feeling of regret for how you chose to spend the last hour and a half of your lifethe good   tye sheridan s performance as a high functioning man with asperger s   seeing john leguizamo in something since john wick chapter   and a briefly topless ana de armasthe bad   everything elsetldr  skip this one for sure see past the crime movie  see past the thiller  see past the hollywood  this movie was great with   incredible actors  if people do not understand deeper meanings and symbolism  do not watch it  the problem with  the night clerk   and I have seen many films fall into this trap  is that it gives itself a really annoying lead character for the audience to have to follow and side with  now there are two sides to that coin  one is that the character is unique and interesting to watch from a medical point of view  and that has   that is why the movie puts him there  but the other side of that coin is that it becomes really frustrating and hard to watch very quickly  it gives the film a point of difference  but a point of difference for the sake of it is not always enough tye sheridan does a fantastic job playing the lead role  he nails aspergers syndrome  before it was ever mentioned in the film i was    certain that was what i was looking at  he keeps it up for the entire movie and never drops a scene either  the other cast member who really impressed me was ana de armas  i came to learn of her acting talents in  knives out  and she has impressed me again here  she did not have anything overly special to do in the film  but you could still tell she was a class above the rest the film itself is a little obvious in what it is trying to set up and surprise the audience with  there has   there is one scene in particular that they thought they were being subtle with  but in reality it put all the cards on the table and gave the game away  also there is a mystery element of sorts to the film that  had it been handled differently  could have been really interesting  instead it was just clunky and petered out to dust by the end  i think the thing to watch this film for is sheridan s performance and as a character study of an aspergers syndrome  otherwise there is not a whole lot going for it  before watching any movie  I had   I would always set lower expectation for the movie and it usually pays off  this movie is like that  you have to know what you are getting into and you must know what your expectation if you expect full blown mystery thriller like primal fear  prepare to be disappointed  but if you expect something to pass your free time with a short linear mystery thriller  this is the movie for you the plot is quite monotonous with the only twist was at the end but it is what I am expecting by reading the synopsis  it has   it is about an mc who have an asperger syndrom accused of murder  the focus is not whether he did it or not because i think it is pretty self explanatory during the scene  if you as many people expect this as the main focus of this movie  again  prepare to be disappointed  it is about how the mc want to prove that he has   he is innocent without the help of police  how he trapped all who has   who is involved or related to the murder that want to set him up but actually he know s all along and how he set them up again all in all  it has   it is not really that bad  i truly could not wait for this crap to end  first off  you got a hotel employee with asperger with hidden cameras in the rooms watching guest  and it just so happens he witnesses a domestic violence incident  this was just so wrong on so many levels i do not even know where to start  the minute the screen on my tv faded to black  i came here to warn you all  that this was utterly time wasted  i so do not recommend it  the night clerk is socially awkward yet not very convincing as a person with asperger s syndrome  the story is dull  predictable and plods along at a snail s pace  the poor acting of the lead  the silliness of the script and bad editing all combines to make this film difficult to watch through to the end  very amateurish  no idea why they made this movie  it was slow  boring and predictable which is a kinder way of saying stupid  its a film about autism spectrum disorder  a young man with high but ever so locked up mental capasity  who has vast compications connecting to other åeople  working as the night clerk at a hotel  he feels that he can control and surveil the environment  and as part of his self therapy  uses hidden cameras in the hotel rooms  just to practice how to interact with people  especially the female part of the guests  but as a crime occurs on his night watch  things become very dire for him its a strange study into the head of a complicated person  its kinda rainman feeling rendering you while watching  at the same time its not  there are some confussionin the plot  the characters are pretty undeveloped  and its hard to say what reaaly happened in the end  seems to me they were in a hurry to get an end to the story it could have been much better    the grumpy old man gives a   for the main cast  its a small recommend  and a joyridee if youre in the trade of working peoples heads   predictable or not  i found the acting great  and the story  a bittersweet reminder of how naive we used to be as well  or perhaps  still are sometimes  after reading the other users reviews i was kinda of demotivated to watch this movie  fortunately i did watch it and it was a good movie with a capital m   it was not hard to watch at all and it kept my attention throughout i highly recommended it  this movie was not bad  slow but interesting  but the end    so rushed  it spoiled the whole movie  what happened  how  why  tye sheridan really impressed me with his portrayal of a man with asperger s  he is very convincing  from the lack of eye contact to his mannerisms  the story itself is a little slow  and lacks an emotional climax  i have no idea why i watched this till the end when it was annoying me within   minutes  tye sheridan plays a night clerk with aspergers in a motel  i do not know anyone with this affliction  but i do know his character was driving me nuts and his acting came across as forced and phony  the story is preposterous  i thought this was suppose to be a thriller  but it has   it is just an extremely boring and drawn out drama about him trying to cope and in a back story there is a murder  it has   it is just nonsense  with uninspired performances and dialogue  scenes that go on so long you shall   you will be nodding off and towards the end what was boring became confusing and ridiculous  in fact i had no idea what was going on  ana de armas is very beautiful but she needs to avoid cr p like this if she wants a long term career  this is complete hollywood made for television garbage using a real mental condition to wring some sympathy from a bad script with a ludicrous plot  what were any of these people thinking  how did anyone show up on the second day of filming  i loved every minute of this movie   the acting were superb especially tye sheridan s   the brief romance between ana de armas s and tye at the swimming pool was really heartwarming  and lastly i didnt see the ending coming  it fooled me alright  artsy was defeated by slow   dismal  the actors did their part but the writers and editors failed tremendously  slow movie but the acting ',\n",
       "  'was alright  the two lead actors were average but did well for a movie with a dull script love this movie  great acring  great place  worth a watch  i really tried to like it but the more time passed in the movie the worst it got  the only quality of the movie was the acting of the male lead  the female lead was actually a pretty bad in my opinion  her acting was not believable and came off a bit annoying  the script was simply terrible and all over the place  and the worst part was that almost everything about this movie was predictable  a boring and badly written movie  i only commend tye sheridan and john leguzamo detective  in all of this  yes  that statement made you think more and had more twists and turns than this whole movie  at least you have a     chance of having some fun when you see a balloon knot as compared to the    crap you get with this thing  only this slower than this movie a one legged giraffe on a skateboard  tye sheridan s acting was exceptionally excellent  ee    brilliant mate  top work  i understand tye most likely studied his art in depth and it shows here  plus john leguizamo  wow you owned the role and so lovely that you were a good rough cop  who also respected the disorders or  orders of autism   thank you guys for making this great acting with great writing and directing a must watch good cast and nice narrative buildup  slowly brewing  works fine  blade runner   is a continuation of   s blade runner a seemingly impossible task  against all odds and logic  the movie pulls it off the good  the greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story  without delving into spoiler territory blade runner   concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises  there are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all  the idea of keeping the cold war and old iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless  blade runner   does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today  it does not wink at the fears of today s audience  it is its own self contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago the acting is strong across the board with harrison ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film  and looking fit to boot   also  ana de armas needs to be in every movie moving forward  a truly star making turn the bad  a combination of a long running time  a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful  i confess a strong ending brought me back into the film it was losing me for a while there in conclusion  this movie sticks to the ribs after viewing  it seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing  see leisurely pace above   blade runner   pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films  jared leto   in many ways  it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be  a triumph  wow this was terrible and cliched really  if you have no ideas  reason or script just skip it i woke up long enough to feel sorry for a suffering dog  but that is about it  where is the action  where is the crescendo  where is the meaning    what  replicants can now give birth  so they are not replicants anymore and can be considered bona fide humans so what is the morale of all of this   pros  beautiful to look at beautiful women cool technology cons  slownothing is resolved boring script  dialogue and lines typical sequel  a shadow of its prequel  they really should become more judicious in picking which movies need a sequel and if they do that    of sequels will never come to be and the focus will shift towards developing new ideas  for film fanatics like myself  blade runner   is a great film for people to see  regardless if they have witnessed the original or not  on the other hand  if you have never seen the original blade runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action packed thrill ride  then I had   I would have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture  it has   it is very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details  but that has   that is exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone  for nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie  here is why blade runner   is a must see as soon as possible  before dropping you into this world with ryan gosling s character  there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past  but even though that information is given to you  your experience just will not be the same without having viewed the first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it  set out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story  ryan gosling s character  who will remain nameless for the sake of this review  uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past  inevitably involving rick deckard  quite honestly  that has   that is the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience  so let us get technical  if not for anything else  blade runner   benefits from some of the best cinematography I have laid my eyes on in years  from the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects  to the mind  blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department  i have nothing but praise for this film  whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience  the visuals alone should have you applauding  due to their incredibly detailed nature  i personally found the overall film to be magnificent  but when certain scenes were dialogue free and asking you to gasp at the imagery  that has   that is exactly what i was doing  as i feel many audiences members will  again  without giving anything away  once rick deckard  harrison ford  enters the picture  the way both films sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion  it does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past  as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process  with a terrifically restrained performance by ryan gosling  you shall   you will find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall  as he uncovers these mysteries  with the addition of harrison ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances  as well as ana de armas in a role that really took me by surprise  this film was casted to the nines from beginning to end  some may complain about jared leto and dave bautista not being included as much  but i felt as though the served the story quite nicely  in the end  this movie aims to impress sci fi fans across the world  but i feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made  are those who have had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is   s blade runner  i do not say this about films very often  especially when talking about sequels  but i have not been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time  this is definitely a superior film than the original  it has   it is one of the best films of    and I shall   I will be revisiting it very soon  blade runner   is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across the world  and every bit of it is deserved  aside from being very long  this is pretty much a perfect film if you do not try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that are not   am not blatantly answered  if you know what type of film you are in for  or you have at least seen the original and enjoyed it  i cannot recommend this movie enough  just slo mo  acting  and movements with insider jokes to pretend they are clever could someone point out why this blade runner and this blade runner exist  no  did not think so ps  compare the music with this accounting ledger balance sheet line item with vangelis  original   stars for the poor and cute dog over and out  blade runner   of course came with its own expectations and a bar that was set quite high  i was drawn in by the promise of that universe  the graphics and the giant holographic woman and was not disappointed  the cgi and the building  as well as the beautiful women were what i expected  i wish i had a  wife  that pretty unfortunately  again the bar was set high  but this film did not deliver  there are too many loose ends and the film does not give the audience a conclusion  the major surprise regarding replicants and what they can do is also a bridge too far  i do agree that the film is slow  which coupled with the lack of a conclusion brings my rating down     not only it went against the prequel s story  but also it left the door open for another film  nothing happens in this after all  all they did is take our money  put us to sleep very likely and tell us to come back and give them more money for the inevitable sequel franchise universe vomit here are things hinted at but not resolved  dystopia  army  child birth  successor  corporate corruption and of course lovers  relationship do not give it your money  three stars for the girlfriend s eyes  hair  thighs and home cooking  mainly because i fell asleep  why is this film so boring  i mean aside from a menage a trois scene where the girlfriends are actually worth looking at everything else not only transpired so slowly it made little sense as well why anything on screen is happening boggles the mind  ask yourself why any of the narrative is of consequence and there is a blank page as an answer  that is saying much in a film that tries to be profound  the rest    starsboringwell it is a sequel after all  what did i expect anyway  this makes no sense  the girl is hot but i do not understand the point of the film when the replicants are not replicants anymore  let me describe the sequence of blade runner   for youhere goes enter the cinema with an overpriced orange juice that is mandatory because in the last couple of years hollywood has decided it is artsy and de rigueur to make films longer than   hours  the lights dim and commercials kick in for   minutes  a game for pre teens wasting daddy s money on mobile phones and plans kicks in    minutes of endorsements for gm trucks  with some guy whose tone is so macho i roll my eyes  follows  then there is a reminder to get the right debit card to be hip and in  then the film follows for a whopping   hours almost  you would think that th',\n",
       "  'ere was a lot happening and we were kept excited  alas  the only thing that kept me awake was the very periodical appearance of a beautiful eye candy whether real  hologram or laser show version that would keep things exciting if it were not for the sexy and lovable women blade runner   was inane  yes  inane  apparently  not every film needs a sequel  a lesson hollywood did not learn from hangover the script was so corny and the words so elementary one would be excused for thinking this is a practical joke  head of police  yes head of police is told a big lie by a contractor  head of police believes it and all is good  no double checking  no verifying  no details asked no proof required  it is a matter of life and death for the order of the world and  of ok  let us keep rolling guys  the ending was also a joke  a vehicle is drowning and the hero is being drowned but in the last second kills the bad gal and swims back to the vehicle to mount a rescue  for the sequels that will follow   replicants can have and make babies  but how  oh well  watch the prequel blade runner rogue uno  which is coming out in   at that point all i wanted in life was to buy my own joi and luv and go back home       is only second to american remakes of foreign movies  when hollywood remakes international movies my house begins to stink with that said  sequels are a close second and this so called blade runner shows why  in other words  blade runner   is contradictory  pretty holographic wife cooking meals and showing skin    yeah earth sucks now  take that off worlders    yeah what a hell hole  and just a cash cow  ridley scott has finally ran out of different video versions of the original to release and people are sick of the alien prequels and sequels he kept pushing out  they all sucked  and so he has   he is back here get some integrity  my goodness how can you expect an audience to sit through three hours of mind numbing slow mo contradictory conversations that make no sense and expect people to pay for the privilege i guess  we should have known better since it is a sequel all that rescued this film was several hard body  super thin  flaunting babes  yup  those ashamed of the human body  nature and heterosexuality should stay away too  otherwise  without the chicks the film would be a complete bust  the force awakens       mr sandman  the lullaby      blade runner    i still was bored  i am referring to the thin eye candies  the girlfriend and hooker were positively femininely beautiful and worth the price  but this is not a good movie  outside the slender and flaunting body of the eye candies it quickly descends to boredom  i just kept rewinding to check out the actresses  otherwise  zzzz first they make a film to put us to sleep  it is boring  slow  tedious and quite sleep inducing  we fall asleep and catch up on some much needed rest then the  music  is a series of farts and tears and explosions and keeps waking me up  look either get a soundtrack with music or skip it  what is with all the hi tech special effects  sounds instead of music    i read that ridley scott likes to produce more of these  please do not terrible it was so boring  i cannot believe they thought anyone would get through this overlong movie in a dark environment like a cinema  perhaps that is why they had the  soundtrack  which was mostly explosive rip  tears and screeches instead of music to wake us up i did enjoy the dog  the pretty girlfriend and the prostitute  involving a couple of flaunting babies  but otherwise this film is stupid  do you remember the criticism of the prequel where rachel and deckard ride into the sunset on a glorious road amidst beautiful nature  right  here too you can live in opulance in a casino and drink free whiskey and even have your own cute dog  etc snore  what can i tell you  sequels  the set design is fantastic  the girls are sexxxy and i love dogs  the poor dog is it trendy in hollywood to not employ editors and have the film go on and on and on and on  what has   what is more it is a sequel  more about making money than creating a story     to come to think this is a good movie the pretty women and fantasy are welcome and certainly a pleasant rarity in these anti human body times  but this sequel  yup the problem right there  is boring and should not exist it is forced  too long and the contrast to its prequel damning  hollywood needs to stop making these meaningless sequels  they are for losers and only made for cash hoarding because if hollywood was lacking cash it would not pay all these no talents in the millions  at least this was not anti woman and anti female and the women were hot and thin they could have easily done a modern film where all the women are in baggy jump suits and obese and expect us to love it but at least they did not hate on slender and attractive women  that has   that is something these days of course it was a sequel and it was stupid and made little sense  i also have to say it is time for ford to retire  do you know why this is the worst sequel ever  aside from the crappy sequels from disney  not only it is too over long and boring it also makes it beautiful prequel become less attractive to the viewers  that is criminal  sure  the keywords on imdb point out the chicks are pretty but that is not enough justification for more sequels or remakes hollywood  not every film needs a sequel  stop  blade runner   is not a good film  but it is not a complete disaster  a story that did not need telling and logically failed  an overlong and slow moving narrative and a massacre that makes no sense any longer were countered by original visuals and beautiful women  i will go with a rating of     the problems with this film is that it has sequeltitis  they came up with it because they needed to make money from a sequel and have no original ideas the massacred are peaceful and are farming  why do it then  the story moves so slowly that the   hours seem like    the acting is not good  but moderna ctors cannot touch older ones so that is par for the course  when in the original the performance by the chief of police  his goon  the industrialist and the eye maker would rivet and excite or the strong personality of the replicants would make the blood boil here it is a paint by the number series of appearances with that said the futuristic society is fun to watch  even more fun is ana de armas  the sexy and delicious hooker and even the legs of the chief  who is old so has short hair unfortunately   these babes add to the vista and architecture that is most pleasing to the eye in this sequel  what was the point of this film  it was not entertaining  it was slow and it was sleep inducing so there must be a plot or morality instead  right  wrong they are retiring peaceful and oppressed replicants while at the same time making even more confused yet yuplet me give you the reason why they needed this film  hollywood needs sequels like donald trump needs porn stars with std  period  it is a disease and addiction for the weak ps  i asked my wife if she is into a menage a trois for us and said said no  but i know she was watching with interest so at least this film gave us an opening  i am leaving you  we are done  your endless sequels and franchise movies are boring and uninspired  frankly  forgive my crudeness  they all suck you think bringing a couple of sexy babes into our lives will save our marriage  they do not  i watch the chicks  but i still know that you are boring and the fire and passion are gone take care  after being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians   most notably  bohemian rhapsody    rocketman  and  rolling thunder revue  a bob dylan story    it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict  though desirable  biographical approach  that is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous  i came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of the beatles  and their music  through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all  quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing on another level  the film made a satire of the modern music industry  it revealed how the apparent  solo  artists are far from their titles  with huge teams of people pushing them in a preferred  and more commercial  creative direction  taking the musicians  creative power  this was done in a humorous light  as most themes are presented in the film   the romantic aspect of the film is evident from the beginning and is a dominant aspect of the story  possibly shifting the focus of the piece a little too much  however  it still helps provides a satisfying ending the film pays a great amount of respect in a fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts  refreshingly original and entertaining  the story flows and the characters are relatable and well developed  not what i expected from the trailer but i liked it better than what i expected  so nice to see someone take a chance on an original story  the original premise of the movie was fantastic   only one man knows that the beatles ever existed and brings their music to the world it could have been really really great  unfortunately the idea was under developed  it felt as if the film s makers were not quite sure what to do with it it ended up being  nice  and  sweet  when it could have been brilliant  i went into this wondering if they were going to explain the whole premise with it being a dream or such  was he going to get caught and crucified for it  was he going to get the girl  lose the girl  so many movies are fixated on realism and difficulties and negativity  yes  he faces several difficulties  but  the movie is light and beautiful with fantastic music  if i want realism  i watch a documentary  this is what i go to the movies for  really well done  there are some movies that when released simply do not need a big marketing campaign  just a few words of description of the plot are enough to put it on your  must see  list   a struggling musician has a cycling accident during a freak global blackout and wakes to a world where noone other than him remembers the beatles or any of their songs   when i heard this i said to myself  yes  yes  yes   but would it live up to my expectations this is a richard curtis penned film  and that has   that is immediately enough to put a tranche of movie goers off  all his movies have an accent on the uplifting  the positive and or the whimsical  and i can understand why that win',\n",
       "  'ds some people up  if  richard curtissy  was an adjective  and i think it should be  many of these films can be so classified here  although again very richard curtissy  i think he gets the mixture just right      yesterday   for me  was a complete joy from beginning to end i imagine curtis getting this story from a rowdy dinner party round his gaff  he asks his guests  over the third bottle of dessert wine  to play a wild and fantastical  what if  game  in pursuit of the  very good  spare brownie of course   at this particular event  i guess it was co story author jack barth  in his movie writing debut  that made the successful attempt to  hog the brownie   for the premise of  yesterday  is quite brilliant  whilst at the same time being utterly bonkers too that being said  the story is not completely original  i thought there were many similarities to the ricky gervais vehicle of     the invention of lying   where gervais alone finds he suddenly has the ability to tell lies  and finds ill gotten fortune and fame as a result  much like that earlier film  much of the joy here is in the recognition of the gift given and the dawning realisation of what this might actually mean to him  as such  i found the first half of the film a lot more enjoyable than the second the conundrum facing jack is to remeber all of the beatles songs and their lyrics  without having google as a reference   and much fun is had with him stumbling into situations that suddenly remind him of a new track or a particular snatch of lyric there is of course an obvious explanation for the whacky storyline  since the hero has received a potentially serious head injury  but would the film go there   no spoilers here  himesh patel is from tv s  eastenders  but here makes his movie debut  he is perfectly cast as jack malik  in the film  he has   he is a name about to rise from utter obscurity as a lowestoft retail assistant to global superstardom  patel is charming and believable as he squirms with his conscience  a surprising and touching beach scene in the final reel of the film is exquisitely acted the ever watchable and utterly gorgeous lily james here goes brunette  she was actually unrecognisable to me from both the trailer and the poster  here she makes a very believable high school teacher with a side line in management and roadie ing i found ed sheeran s cameo in  bridget jones baby  to be excruciating  but here  in what is quite an extensive part  he is much  much better  i think he has   he is been getting lessons one of the slight disappointments with the film is that it is a danny boyle film that does not feel like a danny boyle film  aside from some inventive on screen titles  i did not detect much of the stylisation that i would expect from one of his films  yes  there are occasional flashes of genius   for example  the scenes where malik is desperately trying to remember the lyrics of eleanor rigby  and those of him watching  big screen  his own social media led rise to super stardom  but otherwise  the visuals and storyline are pretty linear in nature although there are cloyingly gooey bits of this film  the element that weaves it all together   such that  all is forgiven  in my book   is the magical music and lyrics of mccartney  lennon and harrison was there a better year to be born that     well  possibly the mid  to late    s so you were old enough to remember more of it   but although only a child aged between two and nine during their album releases  i felt the benefit of three older siblings who were able to fully embrace beatlemania  and the film delights with its modern day recreations of the classic tracks and  as already mentioned  himesh patel belts them out wonderfully  especially  i thought  with  help    i cannot not give this one   stars  i simply loved it  and cannot wait for its general release  in the uk  on june      so i can go and love it all over again  is it technically a   star film  possibly not  but sometimes you just have to go with the way a film makes you feel  not just as you walk  whistling  out of the cinema but for the whole of the next   hours and  i suspect  longer  in summary  he loves it   yeah  yeah  yeah  yeeeeeaaaaaah   this is an edited version  the full graphical review is available on  one mann s movies  on t internet or facebook  please consider checking it out  thanks   it was a great idea and in some ways the film made the vision work  i just do not think they did enough with it though and instead fell back into the traditional love story formula  the music helped carry a lot of it through  unsurprisingly   what they missed was it was not necessarily the songs themselves but the era in which they came out and the meaning of the time  movie just presented it as almost instant stardom if today s world heard the songs which lets be honest today s generation would not understand half of it  it did not really present a clear vision of  why  which i was looking for towards the end to help tie things up  lights go off on the planet he takes a bump on the head then the beatles never existed  alternate universe  dream  thought there would have been something more there  there were a few things that bothered me with the story that the movie made it seem like they were pieces to the puzzle but then never did anything with them  first is through the film he also finds out other things do not exist as well such as coke  cigarettes  the band oasis  and harry potter  it seemed like these things were going to connect into the story and why the beatles music is not present but they just left it there and he kind of says  oh well  and nothing comes of it  the second was he finds out there are two others that also know the beatles music and again seems like this should be a big part of the story to tie things together as to a bit of  why  but they just have a conversation about it she gives him an address and then that has   that is it  his conversation with what i think is supposed to be john lennon did not make sense either  does that mean the other   exist  did they never meet to make music  just all added up to a great idea that worked early in the film but did not follow through properly  all my opinion of course just left the tribeca film festival where the film premiered  and i have to say  the film was superb  everyone in the film is outstanding and danny boyle does a brilliant job handling some of the greatest songs ever written  speaking of that  the beatles legacy will forever live on with this film  yesterdayso much of this movie was charming  brilliantly acted  and inventive  however somewhere around the middle of the movie   the missing the train scene  it just turned into a big farce  the plot just became unbelievable  it also turned corny and over sentimental  of course i accept the whole movie was built on supernatural premise but what follows must hang together and keep the audience rooting for our hero what was good    i loved the music  i think this made the movie    jack malik  played by himesh patel  did a fine job  he has mastered irony and deadpan  we were all wanted this antihero to have his dream what was challenging    the plot was either so corny or so contrived  some plot twists were just unnecessary and added nothing    elle  played by lily james  lost our sympathy  she was presented as needy and pathetic and just as the culmination of him achieving  their  dream  she tries to make him choose between his dream and her    the conclusion was unsatisfactory  he wanted to be a musician and was fabulous at it  he ended up a teacher  big mistake overall  the was an overly contrived feel good movie  i enjoyed whilst i was watching it  but feel cheated and unsatisfied at the end  saw it at my cinema in lovran  croatia just a few hours ago  so it has   it is still pretty  fresh  while I am writing this the whole idea is great  have not seen those yet in mainstream cinema  the plot is pretty much straight forward  with likeable characters  great music  of course  and when the movie was over  it left me with good feeling and a smile on my face still singing hey jude all actors are really good  but lily james is so adorable in this movie  she shines in her character and steals every scene she is in  liked her the most  obviously  take your girlfriend boyfriend friends family to see this rom com fantasy music comedy in cinema on a big screen  and even if you will not like the movie  you will sing beatles songs after and feel good about it  guaranteed   what a great premise totally wasted by a mediocre screenplay acting is good  but everything else falls flat  sheeran s participation does not really make any sense  he should have been just a cameo   all in all  a big disappointment  there were three main reasons really in seeing  yesterday   the alternative world scenario sounded truly fascinating  one of the most fascinating concepts in recent years to me and a refreshing change from the remakes and sequels constantly made today  like to love a lot of danny boyle s previous films and find him a talented director  the beatles are not all time favourites but do appreciate him highly  understand their influence in music and like a lot of their songs a lot while it could have done more with its concept   yesterday  turned out to still be entertaining and charming that put me and my sister in an uplifting mood leaving the cinema  had not had an easy day  or week even  up to seeing the film  so  yesterday  was a much needed and appreciated antidote  as far as films released in   go  it is neither one of the best or worst in a hit and miss year and somewhere around solid middle if having to rank  yesterday  is a slick looking film  not exemplary but never cheap  lily james looks great and the camera clearly loves her  the music of course is fantastic  it is the beatles after all  with some of their greatest hits exuberantly performed  making one want to sing along regardless of whether they know all the words or not   hey jude  is one of the most memorable examples  the script balances amusing comedy and never over sentimental drama without making it too cartoonish or mawkish  well mostly  story wise   yesterday  captures the feel good spirit affectionately and the portrayal of the music industry was fun and did not get over the top  the john lennon bit is a highlight  boyle has done better and more inspired direction  but still directs at a crisp pace and balances things quite well  the performances are good  a truly charming james coming off best  himesh patel has come on a long way since  eastenders  while kate mckin',\n",
       "  'non is riotous in the manager role on the other viewpoint  the concept was so fascinating and while it is always engaging the story is predictable and a bit too ordinary  especially the final third  which is pretty much exactly as one would expect ed sheeran s  extended cameo  for my tastes was rather puzzling and did not seem to gel with everything else all that aside  it was an enjoyable film on the whole and worth seeing      yesterday is pure cinematic fluff with a lightning bolt of an idea  in moments  those substance less joys earn their cuteness  but  as with writer richard curtis s other films  about time   there has   there is a unique ethical question underscoring the surface  what rights does an artist have over a creation they did not create  should we be honest about  reality  when that reality is not reality  confused  do not worry  that complexity is all but completely brushed under the rug here  opting instead for cheap explanations and corny romance because of unimportant and uninteresting reasons  an aspiring musician  patel  discovers he is the only person in the world who remembers the beatles  patel is great in the lead  with impeccable timing and effortless charm  he manages to steal all these classic songs without losing our sympathy  he has   he is supported by a handful of genuinely funny and sweet moments  jokes at the expense of oasis and ed sheeran  the reveals of other erased cultural touchstones  coca cola  harry potter  etc   even a surprisingly moving reveal of others who remember the past  unfortunately  the story does not do much to help  lazy storytelling shortcuts are taken at every turn  making a fantastical concept even more difficult to believe curtis is usually quite adept with this type of rom dramedy  but he has   he is not at the helm here  boyle is  and he has   he is known for his hyper stylized direction  which proves problematic  where he spends time working on montages of ridiculous metaphorical storytelling devices  he should be fleshing out character motivations and ethical conundrums  yesterday makes me glad we live in a reality with the beatles  so we can ignore this movie and stay home to listen to abbey road  hey  there is a moment in every one s life when you need a break  and you need to remember that life can be simple  can be romantic  can be wistful  can be about remembering what matters and why this movie is not about fixing the world or fixing the audience  it is about bringing a smile to your face while providing a special pleasure that we did not know we were missing out on  the one that allow us to revel in the sound  poetry and consciousness of one of the most iconic band the music scene has known i enjoyed the movie with my kid  who used to sing the beatles when she was a toddler and that turned into a teenager not particularly interested in the music her parent enjoyed  who had as much a blast as i did during the movie the acting rand true  the emotion were genuine and the music was a blast  there is absolutely no reason to miss out on this cool concept and movie  to cut a long story short  with a film directed by danny boyle and based on a legendary band such as the beatles  i was expecting significantly better  although the movie is definitely not bad  the love story between jack malik and ellie appleton is excellently interpreted by himesh patel and the gorgeous lily james  while kate mckinnon vervely interprets a sickening impresario  but the movie is globally disappointing with a certain flatness and a script suffering from a blatant lack of originality  the « twilight zone » effect has been seen again and again so many times  in fact  by being slightly in bad faith  the film yesterday     can almost be reduced to the beatles songs  i am fully aware of the exaggeration  but allow me to moan and groan  I am slightly disappointed with such a banal rom com about the beatles  a stuff of legend across all periods of time  i liked it  it was a refreshing change from the blockbuster superhero genre that is choking society jack s struggle with the dishonesty was obvious throughout the film  the music was superb  ed sheeran s portrayal of himself was super cute i was a little worried the writer would take it over the top and ed would decide jack was better than he and decide to stop making music  i am very glad they did not go there with the story jack coming clean near the end and the way he did it  was a good ending for me also the fact that the beatles were not the only thing person to disappear during the blackout was a fun touch all in all  it was an emotional  fun  twist of a movie  this film is an absolutely beautiful story that depicts the beatles  success in such a unique and brilliant way himesh patel  jack malik  has an incredible voice and is absolutely perfect for his role  lily james  ellie appleton  is also the perfect person for her role as she depicts a very sweet school teacher who has been desperate for jack to love him since they met  this is also why the romantic element in this film is flawless and heartwarming  particularly towards the end of the film the film is also very funny and all the cast do an excellent job of making the audience laugh  ed sheeran  playing himself  is hilarious and i am very glad that he agreed to be a part of this film do you enjoy the beatles and their songs  comedy  romance  fantasy  if you enjoy any of these things  i guarantee you will love this film and i recommend you see it as soon as possible  what a sweet  wonderful film  even if you did not grow up with the beatles music like i did  you should have a great appreciation for this film  whoever came up with the idea is a genius  the acting is wonderful  the direction seems to be having as much fun as the actors are  the music is  well  mostly the beatles  but with new and fun arrangements that pay so much honor to the originals  and with the sweet little twists  this movie does have a simple  but touching moral  plus you have got kate mckinnon  who can read a phone book and be amazing  you kids under   will not know what a phone book is  if you need two hours to forget about all the bad things in this world or in your life and to just feel happy  go see this movie  after bohemian rhapsody and rocketman  yesterday is the next movie based on the classic song sang by a classic musicians  but unlike bohemian rhapsody and rocketman which are biography movies  yesterday is a fantasy comedy movie which is a different take from the previous two  did the movie deliver or did the movie disappoint  after seeing the first trailer back in february i was very interested in the its unique concept of the movie the plot for the movie centers around jack malek who is a struggling musician until he had a bus crash while power was turned off about   seconds he then finds out that he is the only person who knows the songs of the beatles the movie delivered on its premised in a lot of levels  the performances by himesh patel and lily james was excellent they had great chemistry and you can feel their friendship grew throughout the movie  i thought ed sheeran was not that bad in the movie and he was a lot better than i expecting considering that most real life musicians acting was mostly bad  the movie featured lots of classic beatles which was great even though let it be was on briefly i was expecting a full version of the record in the movie  but that did not ruin the whole movie  the ending of movie was very moving and emotional do not going to say anything about the ending but it was lovely ending overall the movie was excellent it was original but unlike a lot of original movies that has a great premise but did not deliver this movie does deliver with great performances and a wonderful ending this movie is to enjoy by everyone who loves the the beatles or just want to have a great fun time at the cinema  i highly recommend it  I am no film buff  this ticked all my boxes  great music  and every emotion covered  it has   it is not deep but in its own way it digs deeper than most  love  love love it  of course the film is packaged within the most basic  cliched even  romcom format  childhood sweethearts never expressed love for each other  then something happens  their relationship gets strained  until love wins and is declared publicly this is not a whodunnit  you can guess the ending from the trailer  you will have seen countless films like this and you come to expect everything that happens to happen  just as you expect a chorus after a verse in a beatles song  or any other pop song but within that outer layer there is a very interesting subject that the film explores  what if we lost something that brings us all together  what if we did not have a shared cultural experience to which we all give the same meaning when the blackout happens  the beatles are not the only thing that disappears from public memory  jack googles  coke  and the search engine   which is what gives meaning these days   displays a picture of pablo escobar  so when jack asks a waitress for coke  it is not a ubiquitous beverage that the woman thinks of and so jack finds himself with the opportunity to gain fame and riches by appropriating what had been a pillar of our post war popular culture globally  the beatles catalogue  because the true premise of the film is this  everyone likes the beatles  and beatles songs therefore can be used by us all to communicate with each other soon though jack finds that the music has lost its universal meaning for the people who now appreciate  his  music  he is confronted with the ruthless pragmatism of the music industry  all the while being isolated by his alien cultural baggage and climb to fame so when he reunites with the only two other people unaffected by the blackout  he finds that meaning again  and the plot finally twists this is not a film about the beatles  music  it is not a documentary about their legacy   it has   it is a film about a world suddenly losing shared experience  about losing a  consensus  that brought us together that has   that is why i thought the ending  the other part of the ending  the one I am not going to spoil  was so uplifting and progressive  go watch it  i liked it  i was twelve when the beatles became famous so i grew up with them  more than once a tear threatened to roll down my cheek but I am a simple lass so what the hell  I am no big arsed critic who is paid to be clever and differant  i thought the writing and the acting was spot on  as someone whose had a bit of success  i appreciated that a great deal  very authentic i thought  but her',\n",
       "  'e s the thing  about that cameo    i will not say who it is but when it happened  my jaw hit the floor  amazing  well done  and so  so sad great film  I shall   I will definitely buy the dvd as an aside  if we are supposed to write twenty lines at least in these reviews  how come some of these reviews only contain two lines  danny boyle is a director that i usually like  but unfortunately this film disappointed me  i thought it was very cliched and filled to the brim with tropes and bad  cringeworthy dialogue  i thought the acting was good  and the premise was interesting  but they do not live up to the potential of that premise  because rather than exploring the interesting questions that this premise entails like how the world  the music industry  and our understanding of music would change if the beatles were never a thing  they instead just use this as a strange  needlessly complex way of telling a by the books romance  overall i would not exactly recommend this film  and i was pretty disappointed  sat with a big smile on my face the entire time   a world without the beatles is a world that is infinitely worse  yesterday tells the story of jack  an amateur musician who is trying to break into the industry with the help of his best friend ellie  but when he gets hit by a truck riding his bike home one night  he wakes up in an alternate universe where several things have turned out to have never existed  but most importantly the beatles and their songs  jack decides to take advantage of this  and uses the beatles  music to launch his career  becoming the most famous pop star in the world that premise sounds great  and i was looking forward to a surreal comedy  but to be honest  it does not quite live up to it  instead getting distracted by what the actual main plot turned out to be  a cliche romantic comedy with the childhood friend that is secretly in love with the protagonist  only for him to figure it out for himself later the best moments of this film are to do with the central premise of the alternate universe  where jack would reference something  only for the people around him to say  what has   what is that   i mean  it has   it is the same joke in different words basically every time  but hey  the way they execute it is pretty good  there are also some decent satirical moments with jack interacting with the music industry  personified by jack s manager  and an extended cameo by ed sheeran  who falls victim to some self deprecating jokes  but overall seems to be the secondary  star  of the show besides the beatles  music speaking of the beatles  you had   you would be surprised by how little they actually contribute to the plot  for a film that is named after one of their more famous songs  you had   you would think that their music and impact to society would be more than just a plot device for the main character to achieve his success  there has   there is no real commentary as to why the beatles music is so great  you are just told  over and over again  that they are the greatest band ever  and that a world without them ever existing would suck  sure  that is something i would agree with  but the film does not really add much of their own perspective to that side of the story  it just takes that idea as fact the romance is decent  but cliche and overall unremarkable  screenwriter richard curtist definitely knows how to write romances  having written several well regarded romcoms  like love actually and about time  but i would say that yesterday is not quite up to that standard  same goes for danny boyle and the other films he directed compared to this  the direction is not bad  but it has   it is bland and does not really add much to the story  there are some weird shots  like some weird dutch angles near the beginning of the story that seem out of place  but nothing else unusual or amazing about the camerawork either i guess if you like romcoms and beatles music  this movie will definitely be watchable  but for me  as a person who does not actively seek out that genre  this film did not stand out to me in either direction  and overall I am disappointed that they did not take full advantage of the great premise  yesterday is so fun to watch  i loved every moment of it  so good to finally see a film that is not a remake or a sequel  himesh patel and lily james were brilliant and relatable  i loved their chemistry loved all the music obviously   how can you not  the beatles are the biggest selling band in the world  if they did not exist the world deservers to hear their music however above all loved the underlying message  success does not also have to be about the money you make and tell the truth at every possible opportunity you get i cannot wait for this film to be released on dvd so i can watch it again and again  if you go into this expecting a    million action blockbuster you will be dissapointed  what this film delivers is a solid crime drama with some gritty and tense action scenes a strong lead performance by joel kinnaman holds the story together and the film moves swiftly at a pace that never drags if you want a film that gives you actual story over mindless hollywood cgi action  then give this one a chance  if i had read the critics i would have ignored this film i read a good review in the sunday express and went to see the film and liked it a lot i will give no plot spoilers but if you like tough but not dumb crime films you will like this one it does not have the biggest budget or the biggest action sequences but it is a good film the plot is fine but the film also benefits from good locations and a talented cast see this if you get the chance i think you will be glad you did  I have never heard of this film  nor seen any trailers  so i was not expecting much and decided to give it a go since there was not anything i have not already seen to watch  well  wow I am shocked at some of the negative reviews so far  it goes to show you that you cannot please everyone  it has   it is either too hollywood ish or not hollywood enough lol here s why i really liked it  for starters  this is actor andrea di stefano second ever attempt at directing and writing  and compared to some of the films that have come out lately   and from seasoned writer and directors  he nailed it  was it flawless  no  but considering is was not a big budget hollywood production with seasoned filmmakers and with all lead cast being a listers  but instead a british made b grade film with newb filmmakers  this was produced exceptionally well and is a winner imo i found the story very realistic and un hollywood ish  which is refreshing for a change  sure this story has been done many times before  but this one felt authentic  the last time i saw this type of genre movie that surprised and impressed me  was shot caller casting was perfect  with all leads playing their respective roles on point  especially joel kinnaman who nailed his character cinematography was great  the score sound was fitting  and the production location sets authentic  my only critique would be the pacing needed picking up in some parts  and or the   min run time trimmed down at least     mins aside from that  this was one of the best b grade films I have seen  with its unpredictable plot turn at every corner  excellent central performances  all packaged really well by an newbie filmmaker  it has   it is a solid     from me to see any of my    ratings and    reviews  click on my username  great acting wife could have been better   many intense moments and simple  believable script  all of us have seen at least one similar movie in our lifes so dont expect anything new as i do think this movie is just meant to make your heart pump faster  if you have seen the trailer this film does what it says on the tin  it is a decent cop bad guy film that is a little different in its storyline the film rattles along a decent pace and has some good scenes  there is some quite good suspense and action along the way as well where the film is let down is the ending is just so clear  aside from a tiny twist  from about half way through the film and even then  when it happens it has   it is quite a damp squib  there are also parts of the story that just do not stack up  which is a shame as it has good potential  what a nice change to get away from the  typical  holywood action flick and to get into a grittier  morally ambiguous  uncompromising drama  rosamund pike continues to prove what a great actor she is with a performance that echoes her character in beirut  joel kinnaman gives a performance that is just as conflicted and compelling as altered carbon  altogether a great cast that manages to build realistic characters  my only criticism of the script is the overly detailed explanation of fentanyl that pike gives to her team on fbi agents   it has   it is the only point where you feel the film patronises the audience  other than that  a thoroughly enjoyable movie  the informer is an enjoyable and well made thriller  despite the generic plot and some predictable moments  joel kinnaman gives a great lead performance with good supporting performances from common  rosamund pike  clive owen and ana de armas  it has   it is also well paced with an intense fight scene and tense gunfight in the third act  if you like action films with good story plus good acting this is the one for you  personally i really enjoyed this movie and i would go again to it  an absorbing thrill ride of a crime thriller  unlike some reviewers i actually found this well paced with enough twists to keep it interesting and a ruthless violent edge alongside the drama  was tempted to even rate as a   until near the end but i just cannot stand open endings to these things no matter how minor unless we know there ll be a sequel i just want to know how the story is resolved fully  nevertheless one of the better thrillers of the year so far and well worth a watch  this is not normally my kind of movie but i quite enjoyed it  the characters all felt pretty realistic  the actors all did a decent job and the story was compelling it did feel a bit slow at points and i think maybe a little careful trimming could have done the film some good but even so it keeps you engaged and doesnt leave itself too open to easy prediction as you watch worth a watch i would say  started out kinda strong  but quickly fizzled out i was surprised to see such good actors in this mediocre film  except for common  he cannot act himself out of a paper bag in the end it was a disappointment  great  absorbing thriller with good guys  bad guys and guys somewhere ',\n",
       "  'in the middle  sicario   was the last one that i enjoyed as much as this  it was like reading an elmore leonard story but without the humour  i understand that the uk did a good job of standing in for new york  what a surprise because it did feel like the big apple  i liked the flow of the film  you did not always follow what was going on   I am still not sure of the role played by the drugs in the tulips   but the scenes did not linger  the film was a little open ended  if the make the informer    i would buy a ticket for it  the informer  director  andrea de stefanostarring  joel kinnamon rosamund pike ana de armas common clive own etcoverall rating     ex convict pete coslow gets involved with a shooting of a nypd cop  he has to go back to prison in order to stop a drug gang from getting away with there crimes  but the lifes of his wife and child is at risk and its up to officer wilcox   rosamund pike  to help him be reunited with his family  the informer was a good thriller but a flawed film  but still thoroughly entertaining lets get into why this is first of all the film did a fantastic job of delivering an incredibly tense tone  the film did a fantastic job with keeping you on the edge of your seat  in fact i think this is up there with the most tense and unsettling films of the year in my opinion  the film just put the audience through so many uncomfortable situations  and with the lack of soundtrack it really helped with the authenticity of the film  whether it was being attacked in the prison or in my opinion the most uncomfortable scene when the main characters wife and child was being gagged and threatened  also the violence and gore helped with the entertainment value of the film  but also added to the tense tone and impact of each scene with a heads up some very gory things that were borderline   rating in my opinion however my first issue is the slow pacing in the first half of the film  in my opinion the first half of the film was very slow and made me lose interest a few times  there was just a lot of filler conversations and standing around that left me needing something to spice the film up and make it more entertaining  but luckily they more then redeemed themselves in the second half of the film where it had a absolutely fantastic final act  they really went all out in the last half of the film to make you care about all of the characters and to keep you on the edge of your seat  with all the action was non stop within the last     minutes of the film so this more then made up for the first half of the film next i think the informer had a good amount of emotional weight to it  the fact that joel kinnamons character  just wanted to get to his family and the love he showed them really made his character more respected in my opinion  and you related to him a bit more because most people are close to there families so being away from them is hard so everyone couldpassively relate to his emotional state with his wife and kid next i think they really portrayed the harsh reality of prison life really well  a lot of films with prisons in can be very tame with what they show maybe due to the age rating but this film  showed the types of people the horrible conditions that prisoners rightly have to go through so this was just a nice touch to see  however i do have to say that the film was very stereotypical with what type if inhabitants take up prisons  i think having a lot of the prisoners black and to have it split by colour is fairly old fashioned and they should of picked a more diverse group of people now my final two positives would be the fantastic acting was joel kinnamon and rosamund pike  rosamund pike was fantastic in the cop role  she was clever and did not take no for a answer whilst also having a kind heart and a nag for doing the right thing  and joel kinnamon showed great diversity in the film  his character had a great blend of intimidation vulnerability and perseverance and despite maybe not agreeing with some of his actions largely he was a character that you could support however i do have to end on my final two negatives  first of all there was next to no character development or depth to most of the characters  most of the characters were very one dimensional  and petes wife did next to nothing in the film apart from being petes motivation she was just a damsel in distress which was a shame considering the films of today with strong female characters  and finally there was some incredibly dislikable characters  some of joels workmates who killed policemen and threatened his wife and kid were just sick and really made you not like there characters  i know this was the goal but for whatever reason something was off about some of the characters that really made you question the reasoning for them being there in the script overall the informer is a thoroughly entertaining and tense thriller with excellent acting  but is narratively flawed and could used with more developed and likeable characters  joel kinnaman is about the only thing holding this together  he has   he is an excellent actor and if you like him  this is worth watching  the movie is at times suspenseful but hollywood seems to have given up on creating anything even slightly realistic  this movie is absurd and as it goes on  only gets more absurd  towards the end i was actually laughing which is not a good sign when the movie is suppose to be a dramatic thriller  worth a watch for joel or if you have nothing else to watch  an unremarkable action thriller which is not particularly good or bad  just mediocre  it has   it is a bit boring at times  a bit too cliché at times and a bit implausible at times  but the story is gritty  the action scenes are well put together and the acting and characters are good  if a bit   dimensional  from the team that brought you sicario comes another drug fuelled thriller with an amazing cast although set in the usa was filmed on location in the uk and is a uk production  rosamund pike plays  emily blunt  who was missing from sicario   hence why that was so poor in comparison to the first  this one is based on the polish mafia operating in nyc  good tension   good story   great acting   stand out performance for me was the rapper common as the nypd detective with the street cred and look to make him a star in his own right  central to the theme was family and the love of man for his wife and daughter and vice versa caught up in a web of crime he never deserved to be in  it has   it is one those films where the natural good guys and bad guys were twisted to make it more interestingan enjoyable film with a little bit of violence but appropriate to the plot  worth seeing  pad a     the premise of the film is decent but the execution is woeful  the story revolves around a military veteran involved in a drug ring being investigated by the fbi and the nypd unfortunately virtually no time is spent on character introduction   development which makes it hard to care about any of the main protagonists  it has   it is just a series of improbable scenes which bear virtually no relation to each other  it does not help that the audio mixing is terrible rendering much of the dialogue unintelligible joel kinnaman does his best to portray a believable character  but clive owen is his usual wooden self  the other characters are completely forgettable this could have been a decent film but the production and editing are dreadful and completely fail to tell a compelling or even coherent story      and that has   that is being generous  this movie is a prime example of a terrible script screwing up a film the acting is good and the directing okay but the story is so bad that you stop believing in the horrible plot  and they add a terrible finale that suspends any chance of belief that you just laugh and smirk that anyone thought this was a good idea of a story line  plus the ending is so preposterous it feels like it is a tv series with a part   to be continued as if this piece of crap would have a sequel    a   for the acting i really enjoyed it  it is one of the best movies i have seen for a long time  i did not watch the trailer and probably this was helpful  sometimes trailers tells you everything in advance and according to a few comments this is whats happening here aswell  so do not watch the trailer just go and enjoy this exciting movie with excellent actors  the informeri really had high hopes for this movie and some things were good but overall so many aspects were just unsatisfactory and not thought through what was good    the acting was first rate except perhaps for joel kinnaman who had the look but mumbled his way through a very stiff performance  not a good start as in many ways the film rested on him    the cinematography was good and helped the tension and narrative flow what was    too little variety in the movie  all we had was threat menace and    the plot was labyrinthine  keep it simple    some of the turns were ridiculous  the nypd cop arrived on his own to sort out a shoot out  the fbi had authority to act and then tried to conceal their actions  criminal gangs rarely accept new members so the police try to turn existing members  the hostage scene was absurd as any idiot can spot a prisoner from a guard    the informer s wife sophia had the acting skills of a dead ant  the ab school of acting    the clash of theatre and method acting was so marked i laughed aloud this was a boys movie with questionable acting and an absurd script  such a shame when you consider the calibre of actors involved  first found joel kinnaman in the killing and have always really liked his acting  he is a very strong actor  and really enjoyed his role in this movie  it has some strong action sequences with the right amount of drama  would recommend this film  for sure   great complex storyline but easy to follow  very good film with superb acting  confused why the rating is not higher yet  pete  joel kinnaman   is working an an informer for the fbi  their goal is to take down  the general  and his drug operation  the plan had to be aborted when a cop was killed  the general wants pete to go to prison and run a drug operation  the fbi thinks it is a good idea for him to go to prison and get the details  things do not go well while he is in prison either this is a me too crime film  pike is better as a  gone  girl than an fbi agent  the whole film had a me too aspect to it guide  f word  no sex or nudity  my heart pumping all the time   i need to see the next what will happen    enjoyable  entertaining thriller  worth a watch  good acti'],\n",
       " ['am i the only one who felt that way do not get me wrong  this series is really entertaining and witty  but it just felt like the intro to the story itself binge watching is done easily and quickly with seven   minutes episodes on average which just felt like   at the most or a   minutes movie at the end i just asked myself  why they did not go on so that the story gets told   could not they finish in time  that has   that is the only reason  i just gave it   stars  now we have to wait up to a year for the continuation everything else was really good  great show for someone who has grown up with stephen king stories  carrie and breakfast club  building up the characters takes time  and i see that some other viewers think it is too slow   but i like the story been build up from layer to layer  nice start for an interesting story    and great work from young stars  bingeworthy perfect length   episodes   strong performances   with a cliffhanger which makes me want season   right now   ive watched this in one sitting  it just grabs you and sophia lillis is just mesmerazing imo  loved every minute of this show and dying to see if second season will be made    i am not okey with this  because i am desperately waiting for the second season  i found the show entertaining and fun  however    minute episodes   with a total runtime of just over   hours  with a little more editing it may have just been a better movie  i do not see the point of   different   minute episodes  i hope there is a season   but i hope they add a little more substance  from the start you know exactly how it ends  this takes nothing away from the series at all  there has   there is enough going on to keep you interested from start to finish and the length and pacing is absolutely spot on it touches on all the usual high school phase issues and deals with them in the right way as not to offend anyone but more to add comfort to anyone that goes through these problems as a youngster   minus the super hero stuff    as the title says it has   it is not original we have seen all aspects of this type of series before  for me it was a bit like watching the end of the fucking world  sex education with some super hero twist  what more can you want loved it  the only way to watch is in one sitting  look forward to more  i watched all   episodes in one sitting and really liked it  the overall pacing and the writing was what in my opinion made it work  the actors were all great too and i especially thought that wyatt oleffs performance as stanley barber was amazing the ending was also brilliant i am looking forward to season   i am not ok with this hit has   it is hard but thanks to sophia lilies electrifying performance with each episode passing you shall   you will demand for more  this show was a mix of cliché and originality  on one hand you have interesting plots for episodes  crazy situations  and twists and turns  and I am the other you have predictable plots and writing  the acting was great  they made a smart move by getting actors that have worked on projects previously  and wyatt olef is perfect for his role  i enjoyed sofia s performance as well  she really sold me on her character and her ability to change from being an angry or rude character to a charming and like able one is extremely impressive  i also loved sofia bryant  she was great for her role  all the acting was amazing so props to the casting director  one of my main complaints is the inconsistency with the episodes  some of the  were great  some were okay  and some i did not like very much  this would not be a problem if there were more episodes  but considering there are only   it was not convenient  the series does not drag along and the music is amazing  it perfectly fits the mood  i do feel like the last episode was the best one  and it made me feel like the story had just begun  that has   that is another big problem  i felt like the first   episodes were all leading up to the real show  one good thing to come from this is that it made me want more from the show  the potential really shines through I am the last episode and we get to see what the writers and directors can really do and i would have liked to see that more extreme tone through the season  i was suspecting something was going to happen but the scene really did leave me in shock  it was amazing  i want more of that in the show  my only advice for the writing team is do your research  look at what other netflix shows are doing and do not do that  that is the only way you are getting noticed  break the cliché s  you have already started with having the protagonist having a crush on a girl  we rarely see a  possible  lgbtq  lead so props to you guys  make something different and do not be afraid to take risks  overall i like the show and feel like if people give a second season a chance we may really see the ball get rolling  i am super confused as to how this is getting such great reviews  the series felt like a brief overview of a story  a cliff notes  the in between of a movie and a tv series too short for the in depth look you had   you would expect from a series and too long to be considered a movie  just felt like they did not really try  hoo boy  this show annoys me  it had so much potential but it wasted it  let us start at the beginningepisodes     are very boring and repetitive and almost stopped me from finishing the show  i feel like they could have been cut down into   or   episodes and accomplish just as much  and for a show that has   that is only      episodes long  you do not have time to waste repeating yourself  they had   they would just have sydney have a bad day  have her powers blow up  and then repeat also for the first   out of   episodes remember  syd is just an absolute rude to the people who try to be nice to her  except dina   for example  in the bowling alley scene  she makes light  and or fun  of stan s abusive relationship with his dad  also does not help that stan seems a more interesting character than her now  i believe the show gets tremendously better from episodes      syd gets to be more than just angry sad girl and gets to interact with dina  stan and her family in better ways and the story trajectory is looking very interesting but they could not stick the landing  and up until a point  i was loving the final episode  the characters are gelling together perfectly and the story s climax is  chef s kiss  brad s death is such an interesting way to take the story but the writer s had to go and ruin it with the most lazy and cliche cliffhanger i would have been perfectly fine if the show had just ended right there with brad s death  however the writer s had to end it with that cheesy ass line  let us begin    it reminded me of   game of thrones writing it was that bad  it ends the story abruptly and leaves me so unsatisfied now  overall i think this show is a solid     and i will definitely tune in to season   but goddamn i am so annoyed right now i made an account just to review this  it has   it is from the producers of stranger things so you get those vibes but it has   it is so much better  it has   it is darker  deals with more emotions  and is written so well  please watch this i am not okay with this is in similar lines of the end of the fucking world  but with some superpowers and twistssophia lillis was good as the lead and this story just got started with it has   it is final episodealthough the story could have been more strong just like the cast and the act of sophia  i believe it might improve further it has   it is credibility and story tellingi would rate     for this twisted superpower netflix original series easy going  tailored by many cliches yet very adorable  good cast  leading character sophia lillis has star qualities the most enjoyable netflix original show watched  relatable and love the film look a typical netflix show by numbers the lead character is always lesbian  what a suprise the guy is always kind of a wimp  nerd  outsider that has   that is bad in bed  the rest of the guys in a standard netflix show is mostly portayed as bad jockeys or bullies  there has   there is never anyone likeable the soundtrack is also a typical boring thing  random spotify a little and throw some crappy tracks togheter  and people call it great worthless music and oldies nobody cares about and the mind superpower   it has   it is always the same  mind powers  nosebleed from stranger things is exactly the same  is it hard to come up with something else avoid to all costs  this series is a pretty typical adaption of a comic book teen coming of age comedy  it does not have a real hook and the use of the protagonist talking to herself is poorly done  the dialogue  the little that there is  has been done many times before  the angst is predictable and common  so the only thing new is the new superpowers sydney has  even that has been done before  there are many better adaptions done better  this one has nothing really new to offer  immediately this is going to get compared to carrie  and while the comparison is clearly something the show itself embraces  it is actually pretty far removed  at best you could say  like carrie  but with actually realistic people  this is where the show shines  in the realistic actions of its character  so many times there are opportunities for nonsensical reactions to heighten the horror or drama and not once are they taken  and yet it still remains compelling and interesting throughout overall it has   it is not a perfect score as the show leaves a lot of room to grow  and it it stopped at the first series then it will be pretty incomplete  it could also use a little more laugh out loud moments to balance out the drama  but all in all it is a brilliantly crafted show that will no doubt speak to a lot of people  without talking down to them  expected too much but its slow and irritating  plus  there has   there is no bit of adventure  what has   what is been exploring in the first episode is still there as an issue till halfway of the season  sorry but this was not cool at all  why people are calling it powerful no clue but it has   it is extremely powerless and is not at all gripping  you can relate few emotions but overall the show does not get to move on the right track  the big issue with this series was it was really boring  the storyline was predictable the characters had no personality or depth besides stanley  it felt like a bunch of decent   movie mashed together done really poorly  i am not okay with this  feels like it arrived super late to the   s nostalgia boom  it is ridden with clichés  easter eggs and references  it even has its own breakfast club inspired detention episode  not to mention the carrie esque season finale  it has   it is just lame at this point  everything in this show has been done before and way better  truly a montage of john hughes movies  writing was slow and poorly done  rip off of   teen films with a supernatural addition  a few episodes worth of story applied toward a full season   i hope this issue is resolved in season    this show  while good  is lackluster  felt more like an introduction than a full season  if you are over    you shall   you will have seen pretty much every trope in this tiresome mess done before  and better  many many times even if it has   it is your first foray into sabrina the teenage psyker  there has   there is really very little here to hold the attentionto be fair  the leads are at least in the ballpark for their acting ages  but that does not mean they are decent actors  they have little material to work with beyond cliches and gimmicks   there has   there is nothing really character driven here  and zero no chemistry between any of them the lesbian angle is predictable  tired and tawdry  this is kennedy  not amber the score is cookie cutter  but the sets  cinematography  and editing is decent enough  the people making this knew what they were doing   they just did not know why  and it has   it is clear that nobody had any fun with it  this movie looks great  seriously  great camera work  great production design  just a beautiful movie  it has   it is a crying shame the story was so poorly written and the film so poorly directed and edited that the craftsmanship of the cinematography is lost  this is an ambitious story that  sadly  the director and writer were not able to execute  there are a lot of ideas that are not   am not fleshed out  a lot of symbolism that is robbed of deeper meaning  and overall there is a story that does not get told  which is a shame  because i feel like the story they wanted to tell would have been very intr',\n",
       "  'iguing  but sadly they did not know how to tell it  maybe they can revisit this in a decade or two when they have learned their craft a bit more  I had   I would pay to see that  i have so many questions about this movie  but I shall   I will narrow it down to   questions    was that a zombie    why          gretel just yeets hansel out of her life so she can be  witchy  and do  witchy  things      why was gretel the only person in the movie without an english accent   anyway  watch if you want  was not the worst movie I have seen  but i was not a fan  absolutely awful  insulting to be in the horror genre  nothing about this film was scary or horrifying  first movie i ever considered walking out on or falling asleep to  only good thing i can say is the witch was perfectly  movie was extremely slow paced and never picks up at all  truly dreadful and waste of money  even the music choice was awful  robotic techno sounds like i was watching tron     it just falls short  and kind of leaves you unsatisfied  it has   it is beautiful and dark visually  and it had so much potential to be a great movie  but ends up being something better watched at home  well this movie has nothing to do with hansel and gretel really they just used the name to get publicity  hansel seems like an afterthought in this movie without no real impact the movie is really really boring and even though it is only   minutes it feels like a life time  this movie is like a dj who keeps building up and up and up but it never drops the beat never and you end up blue buying couple beers will provide much more entertainment for you than watching this    min movie that felt like    only bright spot was the actress playing the old witch  she was very creepy but nothing really happens i know the story as a kid  and i went in expecting this to be scary and totally different from the story as a kid  the same as they have turned other childhood stories into horror films  this film missed a lot of opportunities to develop the story to make it a great horror film  it was very boring  confusing and not scary at all  it seem like it was a prequel to a much bigger story  i would not waste my money going to the theater to see this  wait until it hits dvd or a streaming app  when the most memorable part of a movie is how many times characters  oink  like pigs  it has   it is not a good thing  the movie is pretty  that has   that is about it  the story goes nowhere  the plot is unengaging  and i was left underwhelmed  the film tries too hard to be artsy  stylish  and taken serious  unfortunately  this makes the movie feel slow and pointless  movies should feel like rollercosters  making the audience feel something  whether it be sadness  fear  or excitement  etc  this one felt equivalent to sitting in a   hour long college lecture on cinematography  I am not gonna say do not see this movie  but i will say that if you really want to see it  i recommend you wait until you can rent stream it to save your money and potentially time if you decide to turn it off  which is a perfect description of this film  muh feminism mixed in with good old fashion boredom  was this supposed to be scary  the only scary thing is the misandry  slow  boring  stupid  no payoff  at least   people in the theater were snoring  they were the lucky ones  the struggle was real  it was a constant fight to stay awake  twice i succumbed to the sandman only to wake up in the same dream   gretel   hansel  tried to put me out again but i was determined to stay awake and torture myself there has   there is no mystery what the premise of this movie is about  everyone knows the age old story of  hansel   gretel   a young brother and sister go into the woods  they find a house made of delicious treats  they eat from the house  get captured by a witch who fattens them up to eat them except they escape and kill her the story has been retold  remixed  and redone several times both literarily and cinematically  the last cinematic version i saw was with jeremy renner and gemma arterton in  hansel   gretel  witch hunters       that was more of a hansel   gretel the adult years where they hunt other witches to prevent other kids from getting eaten or worse this version tries to go the scary route  it was dark and ominous the majority of the movie  they also wanted to give it a new age spin by making gretel the main focus as you can probably gather by the title   gretel   hansel   they have followed the hollywood trend of other movies that have taken known and established stories or franchises and remade them to have a feminine focus  look no further than  star wars    terminator    ghostbusters    ocean s     and others  it has   it is lazy and it has   it is a disservice  the movies are trash  not because they are feminine centric  but because writers are just rehashing something that has made goo gobs of money and gave them heroines as though that is somehow fresh  radical  or unique  it has   it is none of those  it has   it is tired  lazy  and lame  do something new and original and maybe  just maybe  it will be good in  gretel   hansel  gretel was the older sister and  for the most part  caretaker of hansel  while wandering the woods in a state of near starvation they found the witch s house  the witch was a child eater  but she only wanted to eat hansel and not gretel  in gretel she saw power and wanted to help her cultivate that power  hansel  as the witch explained  was only weighing gretel down  if she would only let him go  then she would be free  read  if women would only discard the shackles known as men then they could realize their true potential  that same message was intimated elsewhere in the movie when gretel called the witch  misses  and the witch said   I am not married  do you see a ball and chain on me  if the message was not clear enough from the two aforementioned examples  then there were three men in the movie to make the  male bad  female good  message stronger  of the three men  one was morally reprehensible  one was some sort of animal  and one was chivalrous  so  two of the three men were dangerous while one was good  if that was analogous to real life then that has   that is sad  i only hope that I am of the     that are good gretel finds the strength to save her brother from being eaten  but she also lets him go  the boy was all of nine years old at the oldest and yet he is a male so she had to cut him loose to be the goddess she was meant to be  it has   it is a pathetic retelling of a classic in which neither hansel nor gretel was the dominant character  maybe one day hollywood writers will be creative for a change  and maybe pigs will fly  there has   there is so much they could have done in this movie  but they just    did not  very boring  this movie is not for everybody  that being said  i thoroughly enjoyed it  it has   it is beautifully shot and very well acted  the music by rob is pure fire  this is an art piece for sure  if you are into artsy films with heavy synth soundtracks and gorgeous witches  you shall   you will love this movie  the goth in my black heart loved every minute  🖤 the trailer was the best part of the movie  they had the opportunity to do more with it and missed the mark  definitely should have gone straight to dvd or netflix  i cannot believe i actually paid to see this nothing movie  no action  horror or real story  i kept waiting for something to happen but it never did  people were asleep in the theater and i was debating if  i only have   words for this movie  boring  confusing  and plain in this movie it starts off with the mother of the children angry and wanting the kids out of the house  it starts off kind of how women are better than men  weird but ok i can ignore that  but through out the film the witches also want gretel to learn more because men will resent a powerful woman and end up hating her  at one point during the film gretel gets her period for no reason at all  it has   it is such a weird symbolic movie against men and pro women that kind of isolates the audience  it would have been a  ore interesting film had they left that narrative out apparently witches have feminist values this movie was somewhat disappointing  i did  however  liked the cinematography in this film  the acting was great as well  the problem with the movie is that  it didnt have much going for this movie  i did not connect with the characters in this film and it seemed very plain as far as the story went  i wont spoil anything here but it felt like this could have been much more in my opinion  but  i guess i shouldnt of expected too much from a horror movie in january  i find myself becoming very disillusioned with hollywood s trend of marketing films as horror films  regardless of whether or not they actually hit the mark as horror the plot was underdeveloped yet had so much potential  I have seen the actress who plays gretel in other films before  it  it chapter    sharp objects  and she has   she is always impressed  however in this film  i feel she was not given material that could have been transformed into something more engaging and interesting  the film seemed to want to be artistic  edgy  mysterious  however it failed to really allow for the characters to develop in any real or measurable way there are so many unanswered questions but they do not make the film mysterious as much as it makes the film seem unfinished and showcase the lack of effort put into the script why did the mother lose her mind and throw out her children why was gretel fine with sending her brother back home alone to this clearly unstable woman and stay at the witch s house just another very disappointing film  this movie falls into the niche category of horror movies that throw everything out the window  plot  dialogue  acting     in an effort to be artistic and cerebral  undoubtedly the cinematography is beautiful  but that has   that is the only positive  the plot is thin  the acting is okay but theres nothing there  and the overall movie was a bit boring  a definite creep factor  but not scary at all  which was a real let down  if i could put zero out of ten  i would  i does not deserve a review  boring movie  totally different from the original story  do not waste your money in this disaster of a movie  i took a nap  we decided to go see grettel and hansel after reading a review that it was the  scariest of    whoever wrote that review needs to be schooled in what a horror movie entails  this movie had no plot  eluded to certain gory aspects but  never showed them  i found myself falling asleep waiting for it to be over  do not waste your money or your time on this one  i would not even waste a redbox rental  just a typical january movie  but this one is just sooooo boring  it just fails to gain your attention  you are just waiting for something to happen but it does not  first time i almost walked out of the theater but i did not just so i can tell that the whole movie sucked  the film starten good for me  an intriguing background story of a twisted evil child  the techno music  which some find inappropriate for a film like this  gave the beginning of the film a eerie atmosphere  as time went on  i found that this scary atmosphere was abandoned for an incoherent story that itself did not know where it wanted to go  nevertheless  i thought the film was definitely worth seeing  thanks to the eerie begin and the horrific performance of the witch  gretel and hansel is a film that the mainstream horror fan will not completely reject but that will not be able to appeal to them  maybe we missed something  me and my friend walked out rather disappointed after watching this movie  no clue  no suspense  no horror and well there was absolutely nothing fun about this movie  such a waste of money  it truly is the scariest movie of all time    if you are   years old or younger  maybe i honestly am shocked by all the positive reviews and high rotten tomatoes score  did i see a completely different movie  it starts off very well with a genuinely good opening scene  great cinematography  atmosphere  lighting  a likable child whom you connect with easily  and an interesting encounter takes place between this kid and a very creepy clown  the dialogue is good  there is an eerie sense of dread  and a moment where it aka pennywise goes from being a friendly ish clown to a terrifying villain in an instant through a very well placed awkward stare  it was a moment i was not expecting and gave me hope for the rest of the film  then    it has   it is all downhill from there  after an almost laughable use of cg  this movie has big issues  it is not scary',\n",
       "  '  it has   it is story is weak  if you can even call it a story  it has too many underdeveloped characters  and it is a counterproductive villain with no concrete rules for what it can or can not do the overuse of cg ruined any sense of tension or fear and pennywise s tactics did not make sense  if he feeds off fear  why reveal himself to each of the kids within a close time period  why not concentrate on each child individually  causing far more mental torment and making them an easier kill  pennywise also just randomly manifests himself anywhere at anytime  and disappears randomly  i do not find it scary when the antagonist manifests itself  attacks a character and right before doing damage it vanishes  the story is a mess and there are far too many characters  i swear the first   minutes is the longest montage in film history  a montage of each child s development and exposure to pennywise  it was predictable and monotonous  as for the story  i do not know what to say  besides there really is not one  character motivations are weak  bill is the only one who makes sense  where were the parents at  not a single parent seemed to care about their missing children  the few on screen parents there were  came off as caricatures  and there were a few scenes that felt completely pointless within context of the story  the school bully and his dad  being the oddest so in closing  it is an uneven movie or more accurately a collection of scenes that do not flow well in a tangible story  there are some good laughs  and a few entertaining scenes  but all in all it has   it is just an average movie  which should have been an evident sign  when the original attached director cary fukunaga jumped ship  the opening scene is good  from there on   not as much i guess this movie will please those not familiar with the book much more than those who are  that being said  i do not think it is possible to make a satisfying adaption of  it  without doing it the game of thrones way  more time is needed to dwell on each of the novel s parts to create the feel the book gave us  to tell the story as it was told on paper  so i guess I shall   I will forgive the filmmakers for that the kids are okay  they have managed to portray the losers and the relationship between them decently enough  considering the running time  again  more time is needed for better development  much of what actually happened between the kids and it has been cut  but again   running time  they had to that they have changed the setting from the   to the   was a bad choice  and so are the other changes  they are creating scenes that are not   am not in the book  they are changing things that are there  the biggest problem i have with the film is the execution of the horror  constant jump scares  way too much cgi  and a complete lack of understanding of the fact that less is more  waiting for a scare is the scary part of horror  and this movie just throws everything at you constantly  it just is not terrifying  at all i did not find myself bored  though  besides the poor performance when it came to being scary  it is an okay movie  it just is not a good adaptation  i think the film was good  but did not really live up to expectations  i did not find it that scary  admittedly  one of the jump scares worked on me but otherwise i never felt any dread looming in the pit of my stomach  the film is gorier than the mini series  that has   that is for sure  and i liked that updated aspect  but nothing particularly shocked me  there was quite a bit of special effects that just were not very good  and i think that has   that is a big reason why i just was not very scared the other dumb thing i want to mention is that sometimes the characters fell into predictable horror movie tropes  its just kind of silly when they have already been scared by pennywise many times  knows this all  is not real  and yet will wander off by one of the missing kids going  come here   i mean  really  you are going to fall for that  i think what does save this film are the performances  bill does a good job with pennywise  however  he does lack the charm that tim curry had  but those were always going to be big shoes to fill   clown pun not intended   the kids though were amazing  in particular jaeden lieberher  who played bill  and sophia lillis  who played bev  were the standouts  i also want to give a shoutout to nicholas hamilton  who played henry  for managing to make me feel empathy for a bully  finn wolfhard  from stranger things  plays richie who is meant to be the jokester of the group  and finn does well with that character  i just wish the writers had laid off from the jokes some of the times  you are supposed to be building tension and it kind of gets ruined when he opens his mouth to make a joke about period blood or whatever i see the potential in this film  and i think it could have been really good  i just think they spent too much focus on  shock value  rather than building on an atmosphere  i do not even know what to say  there was so much wasted potential here  i will say that the cinematography  the location  and the children  the losers club  hold up really well for this film  yet  I am still sitting here after seeing this premiere and I am still shaking my head  here is the one thing for me  that ruined the movie  if you do not want any spoilers i suggest you stop reading  here goes  what is going on with all the cgi in this film  computer animated graphics have never scared me and this movie is littered with seemingly terrible and unimpressive visual effects  i had a feeling this was going to happen after watching the directors previous film  mama  anytime something was seemingly scary  or anytime i thought  hey  this movie might redeem itself  it was almost instantaneously followed by some cheap jump scare with a villain who was computer animated to look scary  the human eye is easy to detect how fake cgi can be and folks  let me tell you  this movie relies incredibly heavily on computer animated effects  no incredible monster movie effects from the   here  the sad part about it is that the movie takes place in the    instead of the   like the book   what better way to write a beautiful love letter to the time period than to get some natural  realistic  and horrifying movie effects  the   had the exorcist  top notch real effects  do you remember the thing from the    thhose practical effects still hold up to this day  its truly sad to see computer programs taking the forefront to create scares  anyway  I am rambling   for all of you fans of the book out there   spoiler alert again  you will be disappointed  it only uses the book as a small guideline for the story they decided to craft here  there is no ritual of chud  there is no mummy  werewolf  or drowned children in the standpipe  everything is rushed  this film is just a complete mess and it pains me to say so  if you have not read the book  maybe you shall   you will have a decent time if you can handle cgi  i for one thought it was extremely disappointing  confusing  and ultimately boring and cliché  god  i wish this could have gone a different way if you are truly interested in seeing it    please   please     save your money and go see something else  or at the very least  wait to rent it  what persuaded me to watch this movie was the blessing bestowed upon it by the stories original creator  stephen king  who claimed   i was not prepared for how good it really was  he has   he is not wrong  it  is quite extraordinary  the attention to detail  the subtle but effective comedic undertone and the exquisite cinematography not only do the original title proud  they make this re imagining of the original classic even better than its predecessor  it has   it is a very scary film but what impressed me was how true the film sticks to the original s tricks  it is not filled with loud in your face jump scares  in fact  a lot of what makes this film scary is the slick cinematography and intricate shadow play  the use of lighting and creation of atmosphere is what makes this film so tense  which is why it has   it is perfectly suited for those who like horror movies but without the obnoxious gore watched the pre release as a critic   august    i already had low expectations of this movie because of the immense cgi in the trailers  i felt super conflicted with this movie because the acting was amazing by the entire cast  however there was way too much  comic relief   this is a horror movie  i wanted to feel terrified because i was stuck in terror just about the whole movie  i should have left the theater sore because of being too tense  this did not happen at all  there was only one scene in the entire movie that felt like this and it was the bathroom scene with beverly  that was literally it  no pun intended   the clown was so cliché when it comes to cheap horror movie antics of the     s  it has the retractable teeth like every new zombie movie since the umbrella corporation and it moves all jumpy like every ghost movie that has been out since the ring  absolutely nothing scary about the clown  if tim curry were not in a wheel chair i would have rather had him come back and take the place of penny wise without any cgi  all of the cgi made this movie pure crap  the script writing was ridiculous and felt like it had been pushed through the works entirely too fast  each kids fear was super cheesy and again  nothing but cgi on the tackiest scale they could have ever done  it felt like this movie had so much potential but it was all thrown away because they were too afraid to make it  actually scary   those of you who are real horror movie fans  you will be disappointed  this should have been a  straight to netflix  movie as far as I am concerned and i wish i could have gotten at least     of my money back it has become ritual for me to read the novel  it  once a year every year since it was released in    the story is more than a gore fest  it has   it is a story about love and hope and friendship that is still meaningful to me to this day the only thing this movie has in common with the beloved book  is its name and the characters names  it is a literal disaster and a slap in the face to anyone who actually read and cherishes the book  there are no character backstories  nor character development at all  you are literally thrust into the movie expecting to know everything about everyone and why they are the way they are  ie  henry bowers and why he hates the  losers club    he literally starts the movie trying to kill them  this is sad  because a large portion of the novel was meticulously spent doing quite the opposite and made you relate to and fall in love with the characters editing  what editing  this is the worst edited movie I have ever seen in my life and I have seen a lot in   years  it was literally like the film makers shot   scenes  put the film in a hat  and took out said scenes and spliced them together at total random  i cannot describe it any other way than saying  at one point  one of the characters  i cannot tell who  because they all share the exact same personality  says   i banged your mom last night   or something similar  and before the audience can even react  the scene changes to a jump scare happening in another part of town instantly and with no rhyme or reason  you do not have time to laugh at jokes  because they are not   am not funny  unlike stephen king s jokes in the book    and you do not have time to be scared  because you are still trying to process the dick joke that was still being told when the scene abruptly ended while the filming location for the town of derry was suitable  having the movie take place in the   s instead of the   s just to appease the  stranger things  crowd was simply a terrible decision  the   s were a totally different time  and much of the characters  reasoning and mannerisms that you need to make this movie work are lost to a time and cultural difference  these guys call themselves  the losers squad  in this movie for god s sake  kids did not start calling themselves a  squad  until the   s  ie  the monster squad  so  you love the book like me and are still reading  thank you  now let me list just some things that we both love about the book that you will not find anywhere in this movie  the deadlights  the ritual of chud  the mummy and the bridge  the loser s club dam in the barrens  the moving picture book  now its a slide machine   the smokehouse   this is battery acid   the werewolf  making the silver bullet after a game of monopoly  the stand pipe  bower s hair turning white   beep beep richie   the giant bird  the   s ',\n",
       "  'racism against mike  actually mike hanlon himself is missing  the writers just made arguably the most important character an afterthought in this movie   character backstories   hi ho silver away    haystack    i could go on and on and on with god awful editing  absolutely no character backstories  cheap teen jump scares  not being faithful to the book  and too much cgi usage  simply put   if you want to know how this movie is like the book  read the first   pages of  it   and burn the other   pages because that is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortion  I am a huge fan of the   s tv film of  it   especially for its aesthetics and soundtrack  but it left out a lot of content from the original novel  leaving me confused when i first saw it at the age of    this remake  or perhaps actually a  re adaptation   is certainly very timely  what with  stranger things  becoming so huge with pretentious hipsters everywhere  I am still not sure it hits the  scary  factor very well  especially without tim curry s tremendous acting  but it has   it is certainly creepy  it has   it is not nostalgic though  nor does it retain much of the original novel  including the   s setting  changed to the   s to obviously market itself with  stranger things  and  the goonies  my problem with this new adaptation of  it  is that it has   it is addled with cgi and jump scares  neither of which add to its nostalgic appeal  at the risk of sounding like a film snob  if you are trying to make a film set decades before this era  you do not use cgi at all if you can avoid it  unless you really know how to camouflage it  the constant profanity did nothing for the story either  it only gave the false illusion of being edgy  yes  the book had profanity  but king knew where to draw the line and keep the perfect balance of immature vulgarity and true friendship  the sheer level of nerdiness here made me cringe  unlike the tv movie which had genuine friendships and sweet moments of love and joy amidst the horror  just like king s novel  did one of those boys seriously just say  get me my bifocals  i hid them in my second fanny pack   what the hell kind of child wears bifocals  why not just rename him poindexter while they are at it  the kids in the book and the miniseries were never this obnoxiously dorky  and what has   what is with all this new kids on the block stuff  there was a scene in which for no apparent reason all these close ups of nkotb posters pop up on screen  why  just because earlier in the film a kid had been listening to that music  it made no sense  we get loads of terrible one liners from richie comparing the blood in the sewers to  period blood   lovely  eh   and trust me  no way does any thirteen year old talk like this  all kids at that age swear and tell fart jokes and stuff  but even they have their limits mike is only added as an afterthought  which seems borderline offensive  as if they only added him as a token minority whereas in the book and film he was such a complex  central character  he had a strong bond with his father that has   that is totally absent from this film  stan is unlikable  and the newly revamped pennywise the clown has teeth that could rival the most inbred hillbilly  and the most scary thing he seems to be able to do is hop around like some kind of wino  uh yeah  real  spooky   I am shaking in my boots  then we have the film s complete disregard for the friendship  the glue that holds the story together  killing and gore and sex and violence and swearing is not what horror is about  it has   it is about the darker side of life  and this film only portrays it in a cheesy slasher film type of way  I am not trying to sound preachy  but where has   where is the love and friendship between the characters  when it is there  which is not very often  it feels forced  in the old miniseries  it felt authentic and true  and the kids were actually portrayed as kids  not young adults  this new film is completely void of the book s special qualities such as the  hi ho silver   thing and eddie s  battery acid  line  the film just does not have the stunning scenery that the miniseries had  either  the miniseries had an actual gothic revival pump house as the sewer building  the buntzen hydroelectric station of british columbia   and it was creepy and nostalgic and absolutely the perfect choice  it had nailed down the industrial small town in an economic slump kind of look perfectly  too  this film looks too clean for that  with cgi used in all the wrong places to create what looks like fake looking stage sets this film is not completely terrible  it passes the time  but the only thing it has going for it is that the director thinks he has hit some   s vibe gold mine when in reality it just looked like a bad video game full of childish jump scares  i was hoping it might be more like the   film sinister  a genuinely frightening and timeless boogeyman that leaves a subtle unsettling presence wherever it goes  but no  it just looked cheap and lazy  an obvious cash grab that has   that is being way overhyped  a       rating  are you kidding me  even king s   notoriously bad film the mangler was better than this  it has   it is like with good marketing  this new film was able to pull the wool over everybody s eyes and fool them into thinking it was a classic masterpiece  the opening scene of it is so promising   well directed  atmospheric  and skarsgard s clown is compelling to watch  there is a brief moment where while laughing mutually with the kid  the clown suddenly goes quiet and stares menacingly  its brilliantly unsettling  but sadly  that has   that is it as far as unsettling clown performances go   the rest of the film is typical cgi scares  and the clown throwing out taunts like the deriative satire of scary terry in rick and morty  the cinematography and acting is great  its watchable in an afternoon netflix kind of way  but there is no real gist  goal or drive to the story  it all just sort of unfolds scene after scene  goalless and drifty like the string along nature of a police academy film  its ok   but it really is not the classic that people are making out to be  its been incredibly over hyped  i personally found insidious to be a far more effective supernatural chiller  i managed to win a preview screening to  it  on the   of august  in sydney  i had high expectations for this film   and it exceeded them  the acting  great performances all round  the kids had great chemistry  and you really believe that they were all great friends  it reminded me of stand by me and the goonies  out of the child actors  richie  played by finn wolfhard  was my favourite and his jokes cracked the whole cinema up  bill skarsgård as pennywise is scary and really creeped me out  but for me there was just something missing about his character and i think he was not given enough dialogue a minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed  in terms with the development of mike  played by chosen jacobs   but for an adaption from a book  they managed to condense the original material very well overall  it  no pun intended  was a great thriller film that kept me on the edge of my seat  with strong performances  dare i say it  the cheesy   mini series is far superior  despite the hype  this adaptation was a real letdown  the kids were great  however the the cgi was awful and the jump scares were cheap bill skarsgard  hard to tell between him and the cgi this adaptation was lacking in both exposition and soul  all we have here is a cgi clown terrorising some kids  there is no depth to the story of his origins  there is no proper backstory regarding the kids there is absolutely none of the feeling of dread that both the book and the original mini series encapsulated  no atmosphere whatsoever its not a bad film  but highly lacking  there just is not the heart that was there in the mini series  in my opinion  the actors were fine  but the story was not there  i believe there is to be a next installment covering the  now  grown ups  I shall   I will probably watch it   if I have nothing better to do  it has   it is simply not steven king s  it   also they appear to have recycled the cgi lady from   mama  at one point   cannot find it now  but look out for it   beep beep  richie  appears once  so far as i can tell   a long way into the film  against all odds  i looked forward to this  but it has   it is another turkey  steven king tells great stories   why do the hollywood mob insist on killing them  i truly think this was dreadful and not a patch on the original  i hope to goodness they do not remake the stand   what is this  horror for kids  this movie convinces me that the world has gone mad  this is entertainment for what age groups exactly  if its for adults  why is there so much childish humour and dialogue appealing to the sensibilities of an age group that should not be watching this level of blood  guts and graphic murder  the story line is directed towards a certain mentality  which is not of appeal to adults  at least not mature adults  why on earth is this so popular  it failed to scare me on so many levels that i found myself imagining better scenes  how is it acceptable that kids of   years old were in the audience  looking at images of even younger children in the movie having their arm torn from their body  a man with a knife right in his throat  what the hell   as soon as it was revealed that all the horrors were their imaginations  it was a pointless exercise  what happened to all the kids that were floating down at the end  where was the main characters brother at the end  wait for the next episode  no thanks  i would have enjoyed a psychological horror  but gore is not what i was expecting  shows a lack of imagination by the director that he had to resort to this level of candy coated perversity  what a shame  wow  i honestly cannot believe these reviews  i made an imdb account just to write a review  i love the original and have seen it many times  this movie was horrible  i feel insulted by the directors  it was not scary at all  any potential  scary  scene was downplayed by jokes so forcefully inserted into the script  there are multiple  major holes in the story line as well  hole    the group of bullies never once said anything about their buddy missing hole    the girl is pulled down from  floating  and brought back to life  does not that mean that the hundreds of kids that come down from floating at the end come back to life too  or do their rotting corpses fill up the sewers for   years  does georgie come back to life too hole    the girl cannot decide which boy she loves  she took the poem from the pudgy kids room  i have to assume because she randomly ends up with it in her bedroom  but then she thinks that bill wrote the poem somehow  the pudgy kid kisses her  bringing her back to life  true love brings back the dead girl like princess   the frog or something  but she winds up with bill  every cheesy  horror film jump scene was witnessed in this film  the acting was good  but i cannot see how this is touted as a horror film  i felt like i was watching a disney movie by the end of it   spoliers honestly i was really excited about this movie  like really excited  i watched the original it this morning to get ready for it and have some reference  and it was absolutely terrible  seriously  terrible  not only did i want to walk out the second pennywise was shown in the beginning but the rest was torture  i was with other people so i could not walk out  here s the thing  this is the first time I have ever been so disappointed with a movie that i went out of my way to write a review about it  the clown was not scary in the slightest  the teeth were stupid  the acting was a joke  the kids made a ton of terrible and sexual jokes  it did not stick to the original movie whatsoever  they took the  you shall   you will float too  a little too seriously  it just plain sucked  in the original  the kids were innocent and actually dorks but this was pathetic the way the kids were talking  and why the hell did we watch them in their underwear    i still keep wondering how the hell this movie is rated above an   when it should be a disappointment for anyone who knows what a good movie is  this was so much cgi that it took away from the whole movie  i could keep going but i think I have made my point  i would not waste your time or money  watch the trailer and that has   that is as good as it gets  ugh  I shall   I will start this review by addressing that i had no expectation for the movie  i am not a fan of the horror genre as it usually lacks',\n",
       "  ' the thought provoking aspects i look forward to in film  but the reviews were great and i thought I had   I would give it a shot the films antagonist is a demon clown  who can shape shift and move through space in an instant as demonstrated during the film  it abducts  kills and eats children  but can only do so if they are experiencing fear  in the finale fight scene of the movie pennywise is unable to kill and eat beverly because she is not afraid of it but at the start of the movie he kills georgie after having a   minutes conversation with him where they laugh and mingle  georgie even reaches towards it to grab his boat   would he really be so scared of it at that point or was beverly so not scared of an actual demon holding her up by the neck the films plot surrounds around a bunch of disasters that the kids find out seem to happen every   years  this information is found out by a   year old kid named ben  and he figured this out by reading some articles in a library  so this entire town of people has not been able to figure this out  and he informs the rest of the gang that in derry there are substantially more children going missing than anywhere else in the us   if that is the case who is doing the abducting of children when pennywise is on its break all of the disasters have happened near sewage drains  that has   that is how the kids are able to figure out where it lives  but at one point of the movie how was pennywise able to appear in places that have no actual relation to the sewage  pennywise appears and disappears in bills garage and basement  beverlys bathroom  in a building where mikes parents died and in stanleys dads office  if it can appear anywhere why does he choose to murder and abduct near the drain if its only purpose is to feed upon the children as demonstrated in the final act of the film  he is willing to make a deal with the gang to keep bill and let the rest of the children go as after eating bill he would start his   year break again  why would a killer demon clown not be willing to let these kids go anyways and just hunt the other kids in town to feed as these kids are obviously trying to kill him pennywise seems to have unfathomable power as in a scene it is using hair from beverlys sink to grab and pull her but in the final scene it is having a fist fight with a bunch of children  could not it control some sort of object found in the sewer instead to do the same  why is it choosing to not use its full power against people who are fighting back but use such powerful methods when just trying to scare somebody the movie is riddled with cliche has   he is about the bully having a really strict father  the plot point that the only way they can defeat the evil all powerful shape shifting demigod of a clown is to stick together and get over their fears  and of course the scene where the boys find beverly levitating in mid air while she is in a complete state of trance   a coma  and what brings her out of this is a kiss on the lips from one of the boys  before the movie ends beverly is talking about this moment saying  it was like being dead  but when she comes out of her coma she without taking a breath starts quoting the poem one of the boys had sent her the movie takes place during the three months of summer and ends with the start of september where the kids still look bruised and battered from their fight  so it has   it is safe to assume it must have been like a week since it happened  what were the kids doing the rest of the summer as they started seeing the clown as soon as school was out  were they just having terrifying hallucinations of a killer clown and then enjoying the rest of their summer at the beach before going out and hunting it down  the times pan of events in the movie do not seem to reflect the time it actually took to accomplish them this is the first time i have ever considered walking out of the cinema during a movie  nothing  this was a staggeringly ham fisted approach to either king s novel or the miniseries based on it  it missed the point utterly    you will not see a group of children whose shared bond enables them to overcome a monster  you will see a load of bickering kids who seem to barely tolerate each other come together briefly to rescue the kidnapped object of their pre teen lust  you will not see an intelligently written story  you will see a dumbed down  by the numbers screenplay  complete with the usual beats  crisis of faith  catharsis  and all  you will not see belief overpowering evil  you will see a ten minute fight scene where every kid tries to out cool every other kid and get off a schwarzeneggerian one liner this movie is garbage  i cannot express it more eloquently than that  i had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of it in brisbane  the film is absolutely brilliant  bill skarsgård has taken pennywise and made the role his own  creepy  disturbing  humorous  it really possess the creep factor  giving audiences a new reason to fear clowns  the entire casting choices were sensational  all actors really held their own  creating a sense of comradery between the characters  like most people  i do hold the miniseries with tim curry close to my heart  but after seeing this adaptation  i was beyond pleasantly surprised  so much so that upon it being released into cinemas  I shall   I will be back in line to see it again  it really is ridiculous how this movie is being praised like crazy   this movie is so fvcking generic  it was not scary nor was it funny   just stupid   this movie is full of jump scares  that has   that is literally all the movie does  in attempt to  scare  the audience  it has   it is the cheapest and laziest way  to  scare  people  many times the kids in this movie try to be funny  but come off really stupid instead   the scene where the two groups of kids are throwing rocks at each other  and the movie is playing some rock music is so cringy  what the hell  was the point of that scene  ridiculous   and what was up with that zombie homeless looking dude  that zombie guy  talks like a death metal singer and i felt like i was watching the  walking dead   i did not give a fat fvck about any of the kids in this movie  i was  not interested nor was i rooting for the kids  there was nothing  special about any of the kid characters  none of the kids of the   losers club  gets killed in this film  all that tension and none of  the kids get killed  not one    close to the end of the film  pennywise gets his ass beat by a group of  kids with baseball bats and chains  lol  he could not fight them back   stupid movie  first i wanna say great family movie  bring the kids    so they can laugh along with you  i do not want to spoil the immense amount of nothing that happens in this movie  or how you shall   you will grow bored of waiting for  it  to get scary  but i do want to know how much they were paying people walking into the screenings giving this movie a   star rating  or how large is the pr team  i laugh when i see red balloons now  thought i was going to see a horror movie  got a comedy   talk about a let down  having not seen the original movie and only tidbits of the trailer  i did not really know what to expect when walking into the cinema this evening  someone described the movie as  the goonies  meets  a nightmare on elm street    this turned out to be an extremely accurate description the opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark  yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercut by comedy  this happens repeatedly throughout the film  and it works  my friends and i  as well as the entire packed cinema  found ourselves gasping at scenes of sheer terror  then only moments later laughing hysterically at the banter between the main characters i would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart  yet i think even those individuals would find themselves enjoying  it   if not for the horror  then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie  it has   it is as if this is a movie within a movie  a mix of a high school problems coming of age movie and a horror  a brilliant two for one if you ask me great acting from all of the cast as well as excellent writing make this movie a must watch  i am very surprised that this film got such a high ranking  i enjoy the books  films and tv shows of stephen king but found that this film fell way too short  the trailer looks great and pennywise the clown looks terrifying so i was really looking forward to seeing this  but after watching this film which is over   hours long i could not wait for it to finish i was waiting for it to get better but it does not   there was no scare factor whatsoever i just found it a bit boring and such a let down  i really feel this should have just gone straight to dvd   way over hyped  if you liked the goonies  you shall   you will love this  a shockingly poor attempt at producing a horror  terrifying  it is not  scary  it is not  I have seen more horror at at child s party  the tea cup ride at your local fair ground will give you more of a thrill talk about the cliché central  a slow  plot holed  far fetched  continuity riddled farce  cgi was cheap and out of place  this is not a horror  or even a b movie horror  this is more akin to a comedy at best  of course you shall   you will get the odd  jump factor  thrown in for good measure   even these are predictable and poorly scripted  sad to say  scary movie would deserve an oscar pitted against this mess the only saving grace was the make up department did a great job and the acting was not completely off the hype surrounding this film was very well done   i congratulate the marketing and pr companies spin for a complete piece of trash  please  please please   do not franchise this  no more it has   it is not worthy of the big screen cinema  save your money  wait for the dvd bluray release to turn up in your local penny shop  i had high hopes for this movie  in fact  you could say this was one of the most anticipated movies of my lifetime  i was psychologically tormented by tim curry at the age of    and it took several years to get over the weekly nightmares  although aspects of the trailers made me concerned this was going to turn into a jump scare film that you stop taking seriously by the midpoint  the overwhelmingly positive reviews that were coming out after the initial screenings had me optimistic and excited to be the first one telling everyone to go see it  unfortunately  i cannot do that after seeing it the first   minutes of the film were perfect  ultimately what i was most looking forward to from it was a new take on pennywise  i wanted to see what a different actor could do with him  particularly his ability to be psychologically creepy and disturbing  and i felt like i got that in the first scene  and that was pretty much it  after the georgie scene it seemed like anything skarsgård did was masked by cgi  overblown audio  and distracting cinematography in      of his remaining screen time  what has   what is sad is i think the mainstream audience will still eat this style up  the same people who will call this pennywise scarier than the last are the people who said the star wars prequels were better because they had more light sabers in them  ok sure  i enjoyed the crude richie and eddie humor  and thought it was well cast for the most part  but by the end i was almost yawning through the pennywise scenes  i just got out of the film and am alone in a dark basement right now and am not scared in the slightest  there is something wrong with that  as someone who had high hopes for this movie  i can honestly say i am monumentally disappointed  in an attempt to make a more visually stimulating remake of the classic it  this movie ending up looking more like a salvador dali painting  if dali were extremely tacky  the fear factor was taken out and replaced with jump scares and unnecessary gore  and i love gore  bill skarsgard s pennywise seemed more like a mentally incapacitated pedophile than an embodiment of fear  the only salvageable parts of this movie were due to the outstanding child actors and finn wolfhard s admittedly immature  yet hilarious wise cracks  i had hoped that because of this the relationship between the   friends would be properly represented  however  the introduction of certain characters and their back stories were extremely rushed or completely skipped over despite the fact that this movie was about     hours long and focused only on the childhood of the it characters  the only new thing introduced to this movie  that was actually worth watching was the scene with bill and geo',\n",
       "  'rgie near the end  it might be a fun movie to watch with your friends and laugh at  but do not pay money to watch it  it has   it is been a while since I have read the book or seen the first movie  so i apologize if i get some things wrong tldr  the film drags on in the middle by splitting up the crew and subjecting them to meaningless jump scares  this means little character interaction  which is part of what the first movie had going for it   by the time you get to the final confrontation with pennywise  you are just tired of the jump scares and want it to be over because you are not really rooting for the losers  and if you are  it has   it is mostly because of what was established in the first film pros the film starts off great  somehow the scene at the bridge manages to match the iconic opening scene of the first skarsgård is an amazing pennywise and is creepy as hell stan s speech in richie s second flashback is great and actually funny casting is  for the most part  really good  i think it was hard for some of the adult actors to find a balance between being recognizable while still showing how they have matured over time  adult richie is too kid like while bev is too mature to the point of being unrecognizable cons bowers is half assed  literally just used for three jump scares and nothing else  either imply that he died and leave him out or fully use him like he is in the book as the epitome of the corruption in derry the final form of pennywise is unsatisfying  it has   it is literally a clown torso on some sort of arachnid body  they needed to go full arachnid alien like it is in the book  i think this part is just difficult to translate from the book though stan s letter at the end cheapens his death  instead of him literally being unable to handle his fear of it  his suicide is portrayed as a sacrifice to save the others there has   there is next to no character development and very little meaningful interaction between characters  i blame this mostly on the middle   minutes where they all split up  it has   it is totally different from the first film where they are actually a team speaking of which  this part where they all go their separate ways to find their  tokens  is so contrived  the story literally loses all its steam due to this and makes it feel way too long all of the monster scenes except the ones with pennywise have terrible cgi  they might be gross and or startling but you can see them coming and they do not contribute much about     to     of the jokes just kinda fell flat the constant jump scenes and long running time just make this movie exhausting to watch  it was just a constant cycle of  pan to character  give a little backstory  jump scare  repeat   i really  realllly wanted to like this film  as a huge fan of the original mini series  and everything tim curry   i knew I had   I would have a challenge going into both chapter   and chapter   with an open mind  i had to separate  i did not have as high of expectations as i did for chapter   as part   of the mini series was much weaker than the part   anyway as well as stephen king s it  book  the actors were great  even the first few jump scares were decent  and then it just became overkill  and not scary whatsoever  all of the cgi monsters look ridiculous and completely take you out of the moment  i grew up watching     horror  and loving it   the baddies were real and terrifying  for example  mrs  massey  the bloated bathtub corpse in the shining  that was a real  completely horrifying image that has stayed with me   years after i first saw the movie  i do not understand the obsession with cgi when there has   there is no need for it sadly  this movie was just a drawn out bore  why they tried to add so much humor is beyond me  it ruined the entire movie now the guy that plays pennywise did a great job  except for the cgi pennywise  that was out of his hands  when he played the character with no cgi i was blown away  I am a big baby when it comes to scary movies and even i can say i was not scared  the jump scares were alright but the cgi monsters just made the movie feel immature  also    pennywise is a flesh eating clown with hypnotic powers     and they bullied him to death to defeat him  it was just such a corny scene watching pennywise shrink as they say mean things to him lmao firstly  those people giving this a   and      what did they put in your popcorn   did you see a different movie   should you be allowed to leave reviews if your taste in movies is that bad   some poor sod might read your review and go see this movie   do you not feel any guilt this was awful  its not even worth constructing proper sentences for so I shall   I will leave these points here    the terrible acting  it was awful  the actors were either bored or overacting  bill  mike  richie   seriously terrible    what on earth was the need to make this a   hour movie   it was so unnecessarily dragged out and incredibly    the story had no story  mike tells them there has   there is an indian ritual they must collect artefacts for which separates them all for   hours of the movie but then it turns out there was no ritual   what   what was the point of that   ben threw into the fire something he had   he would held dear in his wallet for   years for   no     reason     seperating the characters like that and filling the scenes with flashbacks made sure there was no character    erm what happened to bills wife  bev is kissing all the guys but is still married  they turned bev s character into a gold digging floozy by having her kiss bill then choose the wealthy and better looking ben for his boat     what in the name of all that is mike myers was that terrible cgi about   the old granny scene in the original was scary as she was a creepy old lady not a   foot naked zombie like    speaking of zombies   bowers zombie friend drives cars and breaks him out of an asylum  if zombies can do that  why did pennywise need bowers    speaking of bowers   what was the point of him in all his over acting melodrama  he did nothing  except to prove you can be stabbed in the heart and walk away absolutely    stanley s suicide notes to each and every one of them that he wrote and posted before killing himself   the act was supposed to have been done out of pure fear   not as a human    the grand finale  after spending   hours looking for tokens and mike carrying around a badly built dustbin made in a beginner s pottery class  turns out all you had to do was hurt pennywises feelings by calling him a clown and he will turn into a baby  i have no words    reallypeople do yourselves a favour  avoid this at all costs agh   woah  agh   woah  agh   woah  agh   woah the beginning     mins was a decent setup  well shot and the dinner scene was somewhat funny  then it all goes down hill from there  only  god  knows how i wanted to love this film as a big fan of the  masterpiece  book  i was eager for part ii  i liked the first part  i didnt love it  but it was a good adaption in the other hand  the second part is    slow  i didnt feel the  chemistry  between the adult version of the losers club  dont get me wrong  the acting is good  but    something s off i didnt get the insinuations about ritchie s sexual orientation  why  and it wasnt in the book either   and the way they chose to kill pennywise  that was shameful  ultra simple solution and it made me feel dumb    sigh oh  last but not least  the cgi fest  i really dont like cgi in horror flicks  i dont think it is impossible to use it  not at all  but god    what a cgi monster fest    i think muschietti has a great future and a director  but there has   there is a lot to learn   it part ii is a let down  sadly     it is a disgrace because it is a gross betrayal of the original book  it   the book   is a psychological thriller about friendship  about relationships  it is about the deep fears we have as kids and which grow with us until we are adults  it is about how we learn fighting and ultimately defeating these fears it   the movie  this movie   is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and cgi with the sole purpose of jump scaring the audience  there is no narrative  no storytelling  nothing more than a random   and awfully long   sequence of third league horror vignettes shame on this movie   for   years  i dreamt of you  i craved you  I have missed you  pros the casting director very much shines in the spotlight here  if there is a category for best casting director in the academy award  i am all in to bet that it  chapter two s will not just get nominated  but win very big  the casting director deserves a standing ovation for choosing the right actors for the right characters that resemble a lot with the younger selves from the predecessor you will feel the emotional impact of the losers  club as a whole  the fear that feeds their souls  the memories that hunt them   the hopeless feeling that manipulates their strength all leave a strong impression to wonder within   about the various   disparate forms of it should give a blast of excitement to the audience  this is the most entertaining part of the movie where you get to watch new other worldly creatures lingering within the shadows or the old monsters are back to haunt them with a peek a boo  it is gross  weird and definitely strange the heartwarming story of the losers  club friendship is the beautiful gem you will find in no other horror movies this year  the connection they have is so strong and palpable an excellent set of transition techniques that jump from one place to another  giving that ominous vibe and at the same time feels like an adventure cons albeit the creatures are entertaining to watch  however it lacks the manifestation of the scary rituals that should follow  this is the main problem with the it movies  it is not terrifying nor scary enough to make you have a nightmare  even sometimes it is laughable due to its unprecedented nature of the creatures  features the real form of it is upsetting and disappointing  i can strongly say that the majority will love it has   it is true form from the   television mini series in comparison to the remake because that looks scarier  deadlier   more realistic it is super slow and draggy that it does not need to be at almost   hours mark    hours should be the best run time for this movie like it chapter one  it has nothing much to talk about especially during the first hour  reunion  get together  a few jumpscare parts  that has   that is all there is to it the second act of the movie  halfway  feels as if you are watching   to   different short films instead  because it has that slow burning nature  the scenes feel disjointed from one another  it spends around   minutes to an hour to look at every members of the losers  club being haunted by pennywise verdict  it chapter two is certainly fresh and enjoyable  hopes up not  its extremely slow going story may make the audience bore enough to put you into sleep mode  it chapter two walks you into a journey of the insidious derry town albeit its lack of formidable creatures  okay so saw the first remake of the movie  was absolutely in love  i went and saw the second one today and did not feel any where near close to what i felt for the first one  it was super long but that is not even what upset me  it was just lacking in delivery  pennywise was hardly in the movie  he was in it but they spent so much time soul searching the past of the characters that the real present stuff went lacking  needless to say the first remake is an all time favorite  this one  i definitely should have waited until it came out on dvd  just being honest  the first one was way to good for this to be part    it did not deliver the expectation that the first one set  well  this was a waste  this movie is just a long run of jumpscares  all the f ing time   not at all scary cgi monsters and reusing of the same jokes and  scares   i do not think the director has used a single practical effect in this picture there is no tension or character investing in this movie  and the director manages to make the cast  who works with what they have been giving  look terrible in their acting  it is not scary  just very  very annoying and does not live up to either the book  the mini tv series or part   of the reboot from    even though it also was an cgi orgy  if you like a horror movie  where you do not need a build of tension or the director sticking to a plot or giving the audience a decent payout  but just adds a lot of jumpscares for almost   hours   you will love this  but hey  it has   it is just my opinion   returning to their home town  the',\n",
       "  ' now adult group of friends finds they have been gathered to fulfill the childhood promise that the killer clown pennywise has returned and is on the loose in the town  forcing them to put aside their past traumas to defeat the malevolent being once and for all this was a woefully underwhelming and overblown effort  among its many flaws is the most obvious issue in that there has   there is just no reason for the running time to last this long at all  so much of this one could have been cut down or outright removed  from the introduction of the gang one by one to see where their lives are like now that goes into plenty of detail that could have been accomplished easier  to the incidents in the asylum tormenting the residents inside or just the seemingly endless scenes depicting the escaped inmate under the clown s influence  that these are done in conjunction with utterly boring flashbacks and storytelling that shows how they used to be as kids that just go on forever  serve no purpose to the storyline at all and just seem to focus on seemingly random incidents that just plain dull to get through  it highlights the fact that the main clown does absolutely nothing here with so little screen time as we are focusing on the kids  flashbacks interacting with the clown or building the romance angle instead of in modern times  the other factor to lower this one are the entirely overblown scare attempts that fall completely flat  the cgi here manages to undo so much of the attempts that the scenes of the food coming to life in the chinese restaurant is laughably inept with the black pool looking like a deformed blob like mess that has   that is incredibly cheesy looking and makes no sense in the storyline how that works  much less comes off like any other expected outcome from the very start  likewise  flashbacks to show the kids interacting with pennywise  featuring the confrontation in the apartment  the statue coming to life in the park or the appearance from the sewer grate are all laughably bad and underwhelming with how crude they are  it has   it is pretty disheartening to see so much wasted time in a film this long feature so little chances for something to happen and then showcase such underwhelming and laughably bad work when they do appear  really undermining this one and making for a troublesome effort  there are only a few select aspects that work here  despite generally being underwhelming  the encounter with the kid in the hall of mirrors at the carnival stands out as a wholly enjoyable and solid enough effort that works off the darkness of the setting  the overall creepiness of the concept in general and stellar practical effects that are usually missing from these other scenes  as well  the spirit of unity and brotherhood that they display in the finale when they band together to take on the true form of the creature in the underground sewer lair of pennywise which is not only a great idea to see play out but has some energetic albeit comically over the top action that at least puts some life into things  combined with the creepiness of the main clown and the ability to kill off kids with graphic results  these are all that work for this one rated r  extreme graphic violence  graphic language  underage smoking and continuous violence against children  i personally did not enjoy it   so i did not have much hope for part   but i was expecting them to at least tone down the cgi instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy cgi effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more stephen king books are going to get remakes and it will not be long before we get an all cgi maximum overdrive movie remake there are more scenes with pennywise transforming and creating twisted ways to mess with the returning losers club members but sadly they are all done with cgi and are all standard copy and paste scenes from the original mini series and when the movie finally gets to it has   it is climax the makers of this  horror movie  think by simply making pennywise bigger it instills more fear into the audience when really all it does is scream cgi and all the suspence is watered down to bigger pixels on screen than there where before  terrifying the only and i do mean only saving grace this movie has is the cast they all do a great job on screen especially considering they have to pretend to be scared and flee in terror from a green screen it has   it is not the actors fault this movie was a big let down i recommend watching the original it mini series if you have not already seen it tim curry s performance as pennywise is the reason why people who grew up in the   have a fear of clowns because a great actor in the right role can make all the difference in a movie tim curry will always be pennywise no matter how many remakes are made just like judy garland will always be dorothy in the wizard of oz there performance makes the movie so memorable and it cannot be re created no matter how much cgi you use  after seeing chapter one i expected so much more  unfortunately it did not deliver  the film starts out with an overly graphic bashing scene that tries hard to be topical but instead seems to be there just to dare you to criticize it has   it is honesty  and things just go downhill from there  the loser s club of the first film reunites   years later to have another go at defeating pennywise  but where the kids were charming and you wanted to root for them  the adults all go separate ways to have their own jump scene moments through an overly long two hour middle section of the film  the film bogs because it keeps showing flashbacks to when they were kids instead of building the characters as adults  the effect is that you never really care about them as adults  they are just an excuse to show cgi monsters that never really scare you on any level  the pacing of the film is so roughshod that it never lets any suspense build as it jumps from one scene to the next  while you keep checking your watch wondering how much more of this you shall   you will have to endure  the middle becomes a bit of a horror film mish mash with an homage to john carpenter s the thing  verbatim quote and all  a little bit of toy story erector spider  a dash of poltergeist s native american mumbo jumbo added in with a couple of million years old space entity tossed in in case you needed something to understand what they are up against  james mcavoy s character is jokingly referred to as an author whose book endings suck  a nod to the book  and unfortunately this film does not improve on the novel  it has   it is just an overly long series of vignettes that tie to chapter one in an unsatisfying way   it chapter    is a film based on the steven king s novels  that was released on screen in order to express the horror that the evil clown exposed in the old town of derry  the direction is poor  seems like they did not even try to make it scary or post the image that this story was supposed to show  i remember a scene in the theater where i would laugh to those small babyheaded spiders  the cast looked like they were bored every minute of it  being there just for the title of the film and the publicity it had gained  they did not make any try to act  just reading words and acting accordingly like anybody could do it  the story had some interest but it was all sunk with the terrible acting and directing and at some point took the downroad for good as it seemed like they made it something up to fill it up as they were running out of time  there were many points during the film where i was annoyed  even bored  ready to sleep on my chair  the duration of the film was inexcusable like there were added extra nonsense minutes to it  to sum it up   it chapter    is a movie for young kids aged       because they would be the only ones to appreciate it  i would not recommend it for anyone over that age plus i would not pay to watch it again  it was a really bad try  i would add  pathetic at least  rating      i honestly cannot believe these reviews  this movie truly disappointed me  to director andy muschietti you should put more scenes about the clown  because i seen the scenes is just little bit  that is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortain  this is not horror film  terrifying  it is not  scary it is not  there is nothing scary about this movie  there was so much wasted potential here  consequently i found the movie too long and lost me some part of it  it just does not feel like anything great or memorable  good bye clown and good bye eddie  everything special from chapter one an both of the originals completely removed for cheap not scary cgi effects  lost it has   it is way for the all mighty hollywood blockbuster dollar i could not wait for it to end cgi was horrible at times wait for it to come out on video  at least you can pause it and take a break  very early on in  it chapter two  there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book  but messing up the ending  anyone who is familiar with the  it  book or original mini series will know the ending was not well liked  here now though they had a chance to rectify things  and i can assure you they did  not just in terms of the ending  but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one the film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours  the thing is though i cannot see it having the same impact if it were much shorter  there was a lot of layers to fit in  this is not your average  fast food  horror like the  conjuring  universe films  this is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror  the first half of the film especially  a long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters  showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again  then in the second half of the film  and yes I am talking about almost an entire   minutes  the film kicks into hyper drive with non stop  in your face horror   and it is a sight to behold the cast were again all perfectly selected  bill hader in particular steals the show  he is given some great one liners to work with  much the same as finn wolfhard was  and he nails every one of them  there is also a great stephen king cameo  this is not just a case of blink and you shall   you will miss him  he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue  i was not sure whether  it chapter two  would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves  but it certainly did  i had a great time with this movie and i think any lover of the genre will as well  the first it movie scared the bejeepers out of me  i mean what is scarier than a psychotic clown  unfortunately in chapter   unless you have arachnophobia this movie will do nothing for you in terms of thrills  i feel that one of the reasons the first movie was so good is because of skarsgaard s amazing acting as pennywise  this movie is just cg heavy and very little acting   spoiler  also on an unrelated note the homophobic hate crime at the beginning did absolutely nothing to add to the film and left my thinking  why was that necessary   it chapter   is not a very good movie  but itis not terrible either  i am a big fan of both the book and the mini series  so i may have gone in a bit biased  but where i really liked chapter    i just did not feel it for chapter   the acting is great  but somehow i was not invested in any of the characters  they were just that  characters i was pleasantly surprised the movie opened with the adrian melon scene  this scene is one that makes the story of it  and many other stories of mr  king  so great  besides the obvious evil of pennywise  there are also  real  threats  like homophobic villagers i was very disappointed in the fact the storyline of beverly s husband was completely cut  and the storyline of henry bowers was butchered  the fact that the losers were not only fighting pennywise  but also had to dodge attacks from real people  so more rational fears if you will  was what made the book and the mini series better than this flick all in all  it was an  okay  movie  not great  not terrible  just  meh   well  what can i say  i did not expect too much it has   it is difficult to transform a stephen king book into a good movie  but it has   it is possible  the shawshank redemption  dolores claiborne  stand by me     but there is more bad than good  this is one of the bad ones  lots of jumpscares  all so predictable  i was so bored  i',\n",
       "  ' thought  oh please  not another one  and why do they always feel the need to change the plot  for instance the one about bill not being really sick  why do filmmakers think they know it better than stephen king  or steal from other movies  the thing  and the end  the end  that was the last straw for me  if you read the book you know what it really looks like  i was sooo hoping for a fantastic monster  they used enough cgi  did not they  maybe a little like the queen in alien  the one in the miniseries made me laugh   but no  what a mess  make the clown small  really  stay at home and spend the money on the book  i was very excited to see this film  have been since    when i saw the first one  unfortunately  this one was a huge mess i love the way the first it did not want to be just a horror movie  but rather took time to build up a story  emotional connection  that is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays  however  this was completely thrown out the window in the second one  considering how incredibly long this movie is     of it was just buildup for jumpscares  jumpscares themselves and weird cgi the worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on  jumping all over the place  and most of it was just for shock value  nothing important to the story what i did love was the casting  it was absolutely brilliant  especially eddie i guess this is once again a classic case of   bigger budget does not mean better movie  as well as more cgi does not mean better movie  look  i do not mind being entertained at the movies  but there does come the expectation with such an adaptation of one of the best and most beloved horror novels ever written that it accord some respect while remaining true to the source material my main problem with this film lies in its tonal inconsistency  i could never tell if it was attempting to set a somber  foreboding  menacing feeling  or if it was trying to create an atmosphere conducive towards a lighthearted  hilarious jump scare filled marathon  in one moment it hangs heavy in emotional gravitas  the opening scene is especially brutal and difficult to watch  and stanley s suicide is also fairly dark   and the next  it has   it is so ludicrously over the top and in your face in its execution of its  horror  elements that it produces a jarring sense of tonal discord  what exactly is this film attempting to be  the horror was so absurdly explicitly comedic in its execution  not helped by questionable effects work  that i must assume that was the intent  yet in taking such a directorial approach  it effectively nullified the entire foundation that the movie required to establish and help foment the dreadful tension  atmosphere  and tone necessitated by the narrative  and of which made the book so stellar   and further relegated all the work by the actors and all other aspects of the film that had helped establish it up to that point void  if it was not intentional  then it does nothing so well as to exemplify how the filmmakers hold a fundamental misunderstanding of what actual horror really entails  it chapter two  spends much of its runtime plodding through a mindless  rote  predictable checklist of the characters recovering their artifacts from their youths  to the same tired  mindless  rote  predictable jump scares thrown at you one after the other which you can see coming from a million miles off which further robbed them of all their potency  how am i supposed to care at all about the protagonists  emotional plights  which are portrayed in a serious light  when their antagonist and its supposedly evil forms who are responsible for them are utterly stripped of their malevolence and are portrayed in such a formulaic  repetitive  explicit  and laughably juvenile manner  yes  i know  it  manifests itself also as a pennywise who does utilize a childlike humor to lure his prey in  but that does not mean it was not the only way nor that the entity was not terrifying in all the revelations of its truest forms  they were terrifying in the novel  and here they are a downright riot  a little subtlety  suggestion  imagination  minimalism and unpredictability goes a long way and would have done this film wonders  as that has   that is where the real core of any effective horror resides  it would have not only have helped maintain tonal consistency  it would have made it genuinely unsettling  my theatre was howling at every turn  and I am completely left at a loss as to whether that was what the director intended as is  this film suffers an identity crisis  it is inconsistent  predictable  ludicrously  and unintentionally   hilarious  redundant  overly drawn out to the point of boredom  and worst of all  a downright insult to king  who I am shocked made the cameo he did in tacit approval of this screen adaptation abomination of his finest work  the glaring tonal juxtaposition and abysmal execution robbed me of all interest in witnessing the losers  club finally confront this ultimate evil terrorizing a small maine town every   years  because in the end  it was not an ultimate evil at all      it was a goddamn mockery of one and due to that  i walked out  truly  truly awful  in    henry ford introduced the assembly line to the ford motor company  he made a ton of money and was hailed as a leading innovator  now just a hundred years later  director andy musciehtti brings that same assembly line principle to it chapter two as he serves up his scary products in the exact fashion as the one before this sequel to the highest grossing horror movie of all time  unadjusted  takes place   years later in the same town of derry  maine  the rambunctious kids are all adults now and have gone on their separate paths to some form of success  unfortunately  the good fortune for each is put to an end by the return of pennywise  who seeks more victims for his twisted games  being the only ones that have stopped the evil force  the adults must come together again to put an end to this bloody mess director andy muschietti returns behind the camera after the record breaking success he earned from   s  it   for the second time around  muschietti goes even bigger and bolder than before  both in terms of the horror set pieces and the length when it comes to giving audiences what they came to see  muschietti delivers on adding even more blood  gore  and creepiness  pennywise s indescribable powers get even more creative as his prey are stalked and slaughtered with unnerving brutality the biggest fault that plagued the previous film was its recycling of cheap jump scares that were meant to artificially hold your attention  that same problem is even more glaring in the sequel as any scary moments are just startling moments where something pops out at the screen  the more they happen  the more predictable and boring they are to watch a runtime is never indicative of quality by itself  every movie should earn its length through skill and craftsmanship  and at   minutes   it chapter two  falls way short of earning its record breaking runtime  instead of the horror being a slow burn  it has   it is more of a slow churn as the recycled jump scares quickly lose their minuscule luster and make this already long film feel even longer screenwriter gary dauberman takes up the impossible task of adapting stephen king  a challenge that has killed the careers of countless adapters before him dauberman tries his best to break away from the ridiculousness within king s novel  but his efforts end up backfiring on him and make the film even more awkward as some elements are left in and some left out  the story wants you to take it pretty seriously  but keeping in the weird elements make that almost an impossible task muschietti did not do much to justify the excessive length  but dauberman should shoulder more of the blame with his uneven pacing  the film starts great with the together and playing off each other with a fun and brisk pace  then  against all logic  dauberman has them split up for ninety minutes  severely slowing things to a crawl and forcing the jump scares to keep you awake the highest regards should go to casting director rich delia as he has brilliantly put together a group of adult actors that uncannily look like their younger counterparts  unfortunately  good looks are the only quality some actors possess here james mcavoy does fine as bill  the most evident acting trait he shows off is his struggle to hide his scottish accent with a less than convincing new england one having a rocky    to say the least  jessica chastain follows up the bomb that was  dark phoenix  with another subpar performance  she does not shine as brightly as sophia lillis  younger beverly despite being the more acclaimed actress with a lot more screen time the standout performances come from the two bills in the cast  hader and skarsgård  hader plays adult richie and fairs the best in the cast at toeing the line between drama and comedy skarsgård as pennywise is a sight to see but unfortunately does not get seen for long stretches  between him and heath ledger s joker  future performances for clowns now have an insanely high bar to reach with over five hours of material between two films  the  it  series has come to a less than satisfying close with  it chapter two   there are some things to admire muschietti and co  for doing or trying to do  but for every great bill skarsgård moment  which is all of them   there were just as many moments of wasted potential due to unoriginal filmmaking  overall  between its highs and lows   it chapter two  makes for a semi enjoyable time  just make sure to bring a seat cushion  camille  who was drunk almost every hour of the day from the moment she arrived in town  tries to repress the traumas she has experienced but she is not very successful in that regard  we understand with instant flashback scenes how emotions that camille suppressed suddenly surfaced and she cannot cope with her past  the town s suc cessful drowning atmosphere  combined with masterful work of fiction and image management and with the convincing performance of amy adams  turns the series into a complete mood  so to speak  with the hypnotizing music that plays in the background while watching to the series we seem to be drunk in the wind gap with camille  there are great soundtracks from led zeppelin to the doors  from bob dylan to johnny cash the scene transitions between past memories and the present are very successful  it has   it is like the scenes are intertwined  you are not leaving the general story of the series as you watch the past memories scenes  it has   it is very well tuned  we see that the series does not go on a straight timeline  the scene at the beginning of the episodes is actually the final scene  although not in each episode  some episodes have these time shifts in the background of the series  the words shown for     seconds may give hints about the series  at least when you watch it carefully  it makes you think  who knows  maybe a subliminal message  you are unlikely to guess who the killer is  because in each section you focus on different people  ideas may change as new details emerge  so it has   it is a little hard to guess  something i like about this series  because an unpredictable series is more attractive to me i found the acting very good  i think amy adams deserves the golden globe award with this performance  she conveys her character s mood very well to the audience  you feel deeply the feelings of camille  amy adams and patricia clarkson are really good  i found the tension between them very good  unfortunately  it is not possible to escape from the parents we are attached to  camille also lives this situation deeply  i guess one of the most complicated things in life is the child parent relationship  eliza scanlen who plays the character amma is very successful  like two separate characters in the morning and night  it has   it is like there has   there is someone else in amma when it has   it is night  of course it is necessary to open a separate parentheses to sophia lillis  she performed very well although the first episode starts with a slow pace  the next episodes are moving well  and it reflects thriller very well  the entire town  including the police  seems to be looking for the killer from a single perspective  it has   it is like the killer is the whole town  i love watching horror movies but i cannot say I am scared most of the time  but in this series  there were a lot of scenes that creeped and disturbed me in the series the mystery of the killer is preserved until the last momen',\n",
       "  't  but in the final  the series shoots the audience in the heart with a single sentences  the series manages to leave a shocking effect on viewers with its final  sharp objects gave the message that it wanted to give in eight episodes  i can recommend it for those who love the psychological thriller and killer themed      absolutely brilliant  if your looking for a happy story  look somewhere else  very dark  very depressing  if you have it in you to watch  you get a masterfully spun story of true pain  true guilt and loss  also a very good depiction of mental health  with a final act that is jaw dropping  I have never written a review on here  but this is a masterpiece  the reviews that rate this series poorly   or comment on how slow it is  likely thought this was going to be a murder mystery  it is about murder  but the  who dun it  is secondary  this is a character study in damaged human beings  how they got to that point  and the different ways it manifests in their lives  it is dark and unflinching in some places  and it is fascinating  it is also incredibly well acted  the  slow burn  pace is a dramatic marinade  allowing us to really soak in the character and absorb the experience  it makes the finale that much more impactful  and what a twisty finale it was  if you like character driven stories wrapped in a murder mystery  this will not disappoint  is it slow  yes  it is  but it has   it is also beautifully made  the characters are amazing  the acting is even better and the story is catchy  it has   it is a mystery drama series   it supposed to be slow  to give you time to grow with the characters  to understand every detail  it has   it is not advertised as being the avengers   it has   it is not an action movie    absolutely amazing mini series  there were times that i was confused by quick cuts to flashbacks and flashes of gruesome scenes and wondered if they had   they would ever make sense  but all the while i knew they would come together in the end  this was absolutely true  by the end of the series  all these loose ends were neatly tied into a present with a bow on top  and then the very last scene of the finale blew my mind     would recommend watching  haunting first episode of a show that had me and my wife entranced for the full hour  the editing  cinematography  particularly the framing   mixture of original score and led zep songs  casting and performances were all      it has   it is interesting that amy adams  the best working actress without an oscar  might win an emmy first if the rest of the series is any indication  I have never posted a review before but just had to for this  I have also never binged watched   hours of tv straight before  this was brilliant from the beginning to the very last credit  this series has the nerve of season   of true detective  the cinematography of inception  the clipping of the blade runner  the grit of the wire and the family dysfunction of six feet under  it has   it is all the good things of cinematography in one series  great acting  suspense in every episode and a loss for it only being a miniseries  if you have seen any of adam s earlier works  this one will shock you  her character is not charming  glowing  sweet and innocent  her camille is broken  confused  and in deep pain she has to return to her home town to cover a murder for her newspaper  in doing so  she must confront her own past  which is full of abuse  neglect  addiction  murder     camille has never properly confronted her past  she has drowned it through work  alcohol  and sexual obsession  adam s performance is so nuanced  so perfect  she conveys with a glance what most actors cannot with a soliloquy the production is spot on   especially the editing  camille s past and present collide in quite breathtaking turns   moments sometimes so brief as to seem fleeting you shall   you will want to give this multiple viewings    it will take you time to decipher the story  but you will love every minute of it  dear filmmakers I have noticed a trend in television shows lately  the stories are being dragged out  I shall   I will get to the end of episode   or   and start to feel frustrated because nothing much has happened since the   episode  I shall   I will check the episode list and groan that a good story is being stretched across     episodes  however I am hooked  i need to know what happens  so i continue to watch  but i respectfully request that they be told more concisely  my family has developed a game of sorts to each give our opinion as to how many episodes the story could have actually been told in and inevitably  it is at least half  sharp objects is one of these shows that could have been told in half the episodes  easily  the acting was superb  the story interesting  but the pace was slower than a sunday afternoon  these are good shows  i e   goliath    season   the sinner  the oa  mindhunter  lost in space  and now sharp objects  just to name a few  they are worth watching  but i find them frustrating for plot points to be piecemealed out over so many hours  I am not asking the stories be told like the fast talking legal disclaimers at the end of an am radio ad  but just be tightened up a bit take the first season of stranger things  for instance  it was like an   hour movie where each episode advanced the story line at a very satisfying pace  i could not stop watching and gobbled it all up in one day   i love when all the episodes drop at once   the first and second season of bosch were like this as well  bingeing at its best  now i know this is my opinion and others will disagree with me  but it is a trend i have noticed over the past couple of years and maybe there are others out there who have noticed it too  this is my little two cents worth i find it strange to ask for less of a good thing  but that has   that is what I am asking  i want to watch shows that make me put down my laptop and phone  to make me stop playing games or surf the internet while the show is on  i wanna have to pause to discuss what just happened and look forward to watching more  instead  my reaction to last night s sharp objects was  yay  it has   it is the last episode and we can finally get some answers   the paint has finally dried i sound ungrateful  i know  this show and the others i mentioned are good tv  i thank you for the excellent programming  i just want it to be a little less    stretched thank you  a hats off to jean marce vallee  this is a masterpiece  i still did not get over from the finale  especially from the post credits scenes  this is far better than the brilliant big little lies by the same director  which was really good too  we cannot really decide who did their roles best  amy adams or patricia clarkson or eliza scanlen  they were absolutely stunning  a must watch for all  the love scene between john k and camille should be the clincher for award season  poignant  tender  and shows two humans connecting on a primal basis sharing and understanding each other s paincamille writes her pain on her body then hides it from everyone but john can see thru her guards since he has the same pain  this allows them to connect in a way she never could with detective powerful scene that deserves recognition  masterful in every single frame  if you liked true detective this might appeal to you as well  if you are looking for something to restore your faith in humanity you might want to watch something else  although this eight part hbo limited series has been advertised as a murder mystery  it has   it is really a character study  with the murder plot functioning primarily as an impetus to facilitate engagement with the characters surrounding it  nothing wrong with that  of course  the first season of true detective      still one of the finest seasons of tv ever made  worked as well as it did not because of the ostensible whodunnit  but because of the psychological deep dive into its two central characters  sharp objects is similarly interested not in who has   who is behind a pair of murders in a small missouri town  but in how those murders affect a trio of women caught up in the investigation  feminine in design rather than inherently feminist  the show is a portrait of tainted motherhood and corrupted sisterhood  and focuses on internecine inter generational conflict  matrilineal dysfunction  and how difficult it can be to escape from past trauma  but whilst the acting is exceptional  and the show is well directed and edited  much like the first season of big little lies      it left me wholly unengaged  completely uninterested in any of the characters  and fighting interminable boredom for much of its eight hours  it has   it is yet another example of one of the worst elements of prestige tv  series which are far  far longer than they need to be  sharp objects tells the story of camille preaker  an exceptional amy adams   a reporter for the st  louis chronicle  who is sent back to her hometown of wind gap  missouri to report on the murder of two young girls  a barely functioning alcoholic prone to carving words into her flesh  camille is ill prepared for the effect wind gap has on her psyche  central amongst her demons is her mother  adora  a spectacular patricia clarkson   who looks down on camille with barely concealed disappointment  camille is especially haunted by the memory of her younger sister marian  who died when they were still children  but in the years since camille moved away  adora re married and had another child  amma  eliza scanlen  in a breakout role   who fascinates camille with her dual personality   dutiful daughter from another era who wears elaborate dresses and plays with a doll s house  and roller blading lollypop sucking teenage temptress based on the   gillian flynn novel  sharp objects was written primarily by showrunner marti noxon and flynn herself  with directorial duties handled by jean marc vallée  who also helmed the aforementioned first season of big little lies  vallée was also lead editor  and this is important insofar as the editing is the show s calling card  as he attempts to draw us into camille s psyche via fleeting snippets of childhood memories  the editing rhythms will definitely throw some people off initially  with the frequent one second  or less  cutaways recalling oliver stone s  horizontal editing   however  a more apt comparison would be the free associative editing style of films such as hiroshima mon amour      zerkalo      and probably the best evocation of memory ever put on screen  distant voices  still lives      indeed  the technique is not entirely unlike marcel proust s use of  involuntary memory  in à la recherche du temps perdu   so  for example  adult camille lies in bed and stares at a crack on the ceiling and when we cut back to the bed  she has   she is a child looking at that same crack  adult camille is shown opening a door  and we cut to child camille entering a room  adult camille hears a song and closes her eyes  and when she opens them  she has   she is a child listening to the song on the radio this editing style inculcates us into camille s fractured mind  whilst also hinting at the nature of her trauma  without ever being too explicitly revealing  as will be discussed in a moment  vallée grossly overuses the technique  neutering it of its potency  but that notwithstanding  it has   it is a good example of the importance of  show  do not tell   as well as a great example of content generating form and form simultaneously giving rise to content  the memories are always tied to camille s fragmented psychology  with the brief snippets of recollection acting like splinters impinging on her adult existence another interesting aesthetic aspect of the show is its sense of place  taking place during a hot summer in which the entire cast are permanently sweating  one can practically feel the humidity rising from the screen and smell the pig farm on which so many of the town s people work  but it has   it is not just the sense of tangibility  at times  wind gap comes across as surreal enough to be the location of a david lynch film  the introduction to the town  for example  is a series of long tracking shots which show next to no people  as if the place has been abandoned  later we see amma and two of her friends perpetually roller blading around town like the   century equivalent of the moirai  we also meet a little boy who lives with his meth addicted mother and who carries a gun to ensure their safety thematically  the show covers a lot of ground  almost all of it tied to female experience  specifically motherhood daughterhood  adora is a woefully bad mother wh',\n",
       "  'o made little secret of the fact that she preferred marian to camille  when camille arrives at the house upon her return to wind gap  rather than be happy to see her  adora icily tells her   I am afraid the house is not up to par for visitors   in a rare moment of openness  as camille struggles to understand why adora treats her the way she does  adora tells her   you cannot get close  that has   that is your father  and it has   it is why i think i never loved you  you were born to it  that cold nature  i hope that has   that is of some comfort to you   later she admits that what she wanted from camille more than anything was the one thing camille could not give her   she wanted camille to need her in a more general sense  the show deals with how women respond to familial trauma  it does not engage with feminism at a political or cultural level  but it certainly does so at a personal level  arguing that the pain experienced by abused women is just as valid as that experienced by abused men  that the manifestations of trauma can be just as catastrophic  and that the anger engendered can be just as self destructive  we are very used to seeing stories focused on angry  damaged  hard drinking male characters with dark backgrounds who must fight to control the violence within them  but sharp objects is a story focused on the female equivalent of that trope  indeed  wind gap is a town where women are locked into the virtuous virgin rampant harlot binary  a binary created by men  it has   it is a place where a woman s worth correlates directly with her femininity  her maternal instincts  and her obedient acceptance of her place in androcentric societal structures   everything camille is not however  for all that  i could not get into sharp objects  and by no means did i enjoy it  the biggest problem is the pace  yes  i understand it has   it is a character drama  not a plot heavy murder mystery  but so too was the first season of true detective and never once did i feel that show was moving too slow  with sharp objects  as episode after episode after episode ended flatly  eventually i just stopped caring  aside from a major incident in the first episode  and a couple of big reveals in the penultimate and last episodes  almost nothing happens  and that has   that is not hyperbole  i mean it very literally  tied to this is that the show is far  far too long  the novel is   pages  and could easily have been adapted in a four episode run  but trying to stretch it out over eight  it runs   minutes  means that there are long periods were the narrative stops dead  with the characters not interesting enough to take up the slack  elsewhere  the flashback editing is used so often that it loses its potency and ends up feeling like filler designed only to artificially prolong the runtime  it also starts to feel like vallée is so in love with the technique that he has   he is using it arbitrarily rather than in the service of character or plot  additionally  the show abounds in clichés   from the alcoholic hard as nails journalist to the incompetent local police chief to the out of town detective to whom nobody listens to the gossiping women to the various suspects who are obviously red herrings  vallée also has a tendency to overuse certain images  thus robbing them of their effectiveness   amma and her friends roller blading around town  amma playing silently with her giant dollhouse  shots of the child camille being chased through the woods by a group of jocks  shots of camille filling a water bottle with vodka there has   there is a lot to admire in sharp objects  but precious little to like  although not exactly a work of post metoo fempowerment  it certainly has a female centric perspective  and its examination of issues usually associated with men is interesting  saying some fascinating things about female trauma  the performances are top notch and the editing is decent  albeit overused   but all in all  the show did little for me  i understand that it has   it is designed holistically rather than cumulatively  and i have no problem with that  but the pace is enervating and the characters just are not   am not interesting enough to fill such a lengthy runtime  i love gillian flynn because she writes about real women  fully fleshed out  gritty  strong  good bad and ugly  real women  i love amy adams and patricia clarkson because they convey that beautifully  i was really looking forward to the start of this miniseries because i so loved the book  and so far i am not disappointed  the cinematography and score are fantastic  and the acting is superb  it is a slow burn  as it should be  and it is in equal measure tense  taught  and hauntingly beautiful  i cannot wait to watch the rest of this story unfold  i do not read for pleasure very often  but after seeing the series i bought the book  and devoured it admittedly  the series feels to move slow  but at the end of every episode you are left thinking  what the      in the best possible way  and the pacing of the show just makes the ending that much sweeter and satisfying  great cast  and phenomenal performances from everyone  amy is incredible as usual  the best series I have seen in years  masterpiece    see until the last second  even in the final credits  wow  never felt so many awful feelings after seeing such an amazing show  wow it is raw and real in every sense  the script is finely performed by all the ensemble  and never insults the intelligence of the viewer  it always ends with me wanting to see more  i love everything about it  great atmosphere and soundtrack  very similar in tone and style to big little lies   also by director jean marc vallée  amy adams brings class and subtlety to what is not an especially original storyline  camille  a journalist haunted by ghosts of her past returns to home town to solve murder   but excellence of execution makes this shine  patricia clarkson s portrayal of camille s narcissistic  self absorbed mother is equally effective  you shall   you will find yourself wanting to choke her in every episode  also so refreshing to see women s lives and stories portrayed in a non exploitative way  camille s struggle with alcoholism and self harm is depicted with unblinking realism and is something many women can unfortunately relate to  looking forward to the rest of this series  which is shaping up to be as good as season   of true detective  highly recommend this  this is the type of show i want and need in my life brilliant acting  love patricia clark she is such a dear friend in my head  so talented and beautiful cant forget about the lovely eliza scanlen so skilled  this must have been such a great part to play and  come on amy adams i wanted to scoop you up and take care of you myself  the show proceeds with its own pace  and yet succeeds to keep us hooked  amy adams as camille preaker has displayed remarkable depiction of a girl who has battled self injuries all her life  her troubles feel real  which the actor portrays in a very convincing manner what makes the show successful and a quality watch is how well and deep it is textured  every conversation or scene  ordinary at the surface has a lot going on beneath  one begins to genuinely feel for camille and wonder why she faces the heat of her own mother  who appears to completely despise her the town  the townsfolk  the chitter chatter of the women   feels like a documentary on an american town  something for the international audience to experience and the final reveal on adora definitely comes unexpected and as a shock  there are scenes that are just difficult to watch  events difficult to believe the story ends and one begins to feel the makers are moving towards a patient finish  just like their show s style  but then comes the final twist   something few could have ever imagined  this series addresses the emotional and psychological trauma that can happen when you are dealing with an emotional over protective mother  a complacent father and multiple unsolved murders in small town missouri it keeps you on the edge of your seat until all is revealed and you never know what hit you amazing acting by all main characters and no spoilers here great series    hard to assign this series a number of stars  some aspects    others    the acting was stellar  making the characters believable in their almost unprecedentedly dysfunctional family crucible  and kudos to the way cinematography and editing created the most vivid  inside  view of the mental tortures of ptsd that i know of on film  paralleling the way that a beautiful mind put us inside the mental labyrinths of paranoid schizophrenia   for those commenters who have complained here about the erratic and incessant flashbacks  literally  flash  backs  and found them inexplicable  this would be my response  you were seeing a depiction of the manifestation of ptsd  imagine how anguishing then it is for an actual ptsd sufferer plagued by all such  cuts  and slices of trauma bombarding their mental visions  unrelentingly  but the artistry which achieved that depiction of ptsd is also a disjunct with the series ending where even more frenetic  barely visible cutting and slicing of flashes of violence    seeming to be in the same vein as camille s ptsd that we have been immersed into  racheted up in the splicings into the final credits as if on steroids  cannot serve the same purpose  in terms of the medium being the message  and thus left me with a sour end note as to director s choices  those mid closing  credits scenes were not illustrations of the workings of ptsd  they struck me  and my husband  instead as kind of cheap shortcut twists to stab us  the viewer with  so as to shake us up regarding what had seemed to be the series  final verdict on its crimes and punishments  those cinematic editing choices rode in on the backs of camille s ptsd depictions  so to speak  but they violated the exclusive use of those choices up to that point for illustrating ptsd  these could not plausibly  story perspective wise  be amma s ptsd  they were instead a break away into some  omniscient narrator  visuals  and while the series did put us into the pov of multiple characters  including amma  that never included entering into anyone else s but camille s ptsd flashback experience sensations so that attempted conflating of a use of a film editing  device  to illustrate ptsd and then in the last frames of the whole film to use that same  device  for some wholly other purpose was  for me  a sort of sabotage  and perhaps also a degree of disrespect for the story and or the viewer to relegate such a story twist to a barely recognizable insertion mid final credits  other films have deftly left us with final twists that  owned  themselves  for one thing by coming before final credits   films for example that leave us with some micro last minute filmed focus on a detail that changes everything  such as making us know that we had   we would been watching someone s dream rather than  reality     mulholland drive  and  take shelter  come to mind  their endings then became controversial fare for folks like us to debate as to what their ramifications and implications were for reframing the entire film s plotline  but that works  sharp object s post ending ending just felt shortchanged and inappropriate to the film s chosen form function schema  it also felt a bit cheap storytelling wise to have adora  in her very last extended scene with camille  segue into a bit of her own backstory to telegraph to the viewer that she came by her dysfunctions  legitimately  i e   handed down by her own mother to her  i would suspect that the novel did not wait until the last minute to weave that message into the telling  as an aside  viscerally  the hardest thing in the film for me was getting my mind around camille s cutting  most specifically  was she supposed to have engaged  at least sometimes in  collaborative cutting  à la tattooing  how could she have  achieved  those cuttings into her back  unlike tattooing  which is inherently social  cutting is a very isolationist dis ease  it felt disrespectful of the viewer not to give any kind of accounting for how those backside word cuts could have happened  thus leaving it in the realm of implausibility  the acting is best thing about this  the story is very slow and boring  constant flashbacks with no context are hard to interpret  make no sense  the camera is constantly shaking which gets more and more noticeable as the episode progresses  at the time of writing this has an     score  which simply cannot be true  i gave it a try but i definitely will not waste any more time on t'],\n",
       " ['first off  i enjoyed season   of the    season   was inferior compared to other seasons the   is an american post apocalyptic drama television series  i love the   because it has a unique story line    years after a nuclear apocalypse    prisoners sent down to the earth to see if it is survivable for the ark and it has   it is lacking resources  this show is another amazing and intriguing apocalyptic show that has caught my attention  i was sceptical at first as i am not a huge fan of the cw s channel however i realised that this is an exception to that thought  i have so far really enjoyed watching it and am hooked  if you like the walking dead  revolution or lost then you will love this show  if you like apocalytic  intense  thrilling  quality dramas  this is your show  it has a nuclear and isolated feel to it and it has yet to disappoint me  if you like the show too  please spread the word as much as possible  the show cannot survive without support and good ratings so encourage those around you there are so many cool sci fi themes and issues in the show that it really keeps you interested in watching  characters are also very interesting and bring you in  i would highly recommend this show to any sci fi fan  you will not be disappointed      the   does something not many series can do  it gets better with every season  the character development is great and realistic  honestly i do not know exactly what to say other than that this is a great series with an actually good story and writing that makes sense  there are not   am not huge plotholes which is extremely important for a sci fi show  seriously stick with this show  i watch a lot of tv and when i first started watching the   i found the dialogue accuracy questionable and it seemed like just another cw show  i stayed with it mostly for the interesting concept and wow  the second season develops into one of the most exciting programs out there right now  the storyline moves around like lightening  the characters go on believable arcs which deliver amazing transformations in some cases  it has   it is highly original and creates some fascinating dynamics between characters which you do not see anywhere else  ok it has   it is not perfect  sometimes the science makes me frown  but it does so much right i barely pay attention to the increasingly rare blips now heading towards the end of season    every scene is compelling and feels important and you care about what happens because they have built it in the right way  do not expect the fluffy love stories cw is famous for  this is in no way a show just for teenagers  it has   it is not afraid to kill people  and deaths are permanent  thank goodness   the way they bring up questions of morality and strategy  the ambiguity of the characters  the head on approach to the subject matter  all are fascinating  it has   it is gritty and edgy with excellent production value and the only other program I am getting the same level of epic from right now is game of thrones I have never written a review before but i just had to support this show and want it to get past any stigma it created in the initial episodes  check out the ratings in season    those are earned and well deserved  binge watch it people  you will not regret it  watched seasons     three times love this show  i learn something new every time i watch it  love the characters  cannot wait for the season i started watching this because had nothing to do  first impression  low budget acting and mediocre scripters  but surprisingly  i got hooked  this show is actually good now we do need to warn the nerdy  let us hang bugs bunny for being historically inaccurate type of listener  a tv show is supposed to give you a break from reality so everything in it does not have to be perfect  this is a show  a make believe world made to entertain people  it does not have to be scientifically accurate to be good  television shows are stories  not the real world  get over it for pete s sake first couple of episodes will leave you with a weird feeling of watching a teen drama poorly written  but trust me  it gets better and becomes quickly interesting  gives me the impression that the whole getting to earth episodes were not written by the same person  as soon as that passage is behind you  the show gets really interesting  got me hooked  before watching the   you have to accept the obvious  it is a drama put on by the cw  the same folks that brought you    about a group of   teens left stranded on earth by a society that has been living in space for a century  it is needless to say that the show is going to ask viewers to suspend their disbelief for the   minutes it takes to watch an episode  a lot of people tend to criticize the show for being unrealistic scientifically  the problem with this being that of course the show is going to be unrealistic  you have to accept that the premise of the show is that   teens get stranded on earth by their race of space people   years after a nuclear disaster sometimes television programs do not abide by standard rules of physics  or any kind of science for that matter  sometimes that has   that is what television is there for   to give you a break from the believable  if you are a stickler for scientific accuracy or a big fan of classic sci fi the reality is that this might not be the show for you  if  however  you are someone looking for something exciting and  honestly  addicting to watch you might be in luck in regards to the script i can honestly say that i suffered through   cringing all the way and while some of the   s script might be a little cringe worthy to start  it is certainly much better than most  if not all  of the teen dramas on television  this is a good show  you just have to accept what you are getting yourself into  the series was off to a slow start  but it is getting better and better  the premise is original and fun  and it keeps you on the edge of your seat  there is no doubt about it that this show is one to keep an eye on  it seems it gets darker each episode  but with that said that could also end up killing the show as a lot of viewers have accepted its violence so far because it has been done tastefully  without too much gore  most of the bloodier scenes take place in a dark place or is carefully done by camera angles to get the point across but to not upset the cw s typical viewers  and this is great in a world of the walking death and game of thrones  etc  it has   it is a welcome method of delivering the same intensity without being overly grotesque  there are too many negative comments on this website regarding this show  it has   it is getting good  i expect to see this series renewed soon  I have read a couple of these reviews  both negative and positive  i agree with both  yes  there are definitely holes and i too believe it has a slow start  that being said  it was not slow enough to make me not watch the second episode  or the one after that  you have to appreciate it for what it is  it has an allure  the concept is what makes it interesting  i can poke holes in every well liked show  as I am sure many others can  i kept watching because i felt the show had potential  no matter what route it took  there are still things that irk me about this show  but the things i enjoy outweigh the things i do not  i rated it a   because i went in watching it without huge expectations  and became hooked  i watched episode after episode and finished the first season in   days  this is watching back to back episodes after   hour work days   i love this show because it left me wanting more and i enjoyed watching it  they made some bold choices by deciding to show certain things as well which made it more realistic  regarding human behavior   i can definitely say it gets more exciting  i felt myself predicting things that might happen  but expecting them not too because it seemed too daring for tv  but i was pleasantly surprised  my overall advice is that you do not go in watching it with this grand idea of it  not to say it is not grand  but romanticizing it in your head can easily turn into disappointment   and just give it the chance it deserves  personally  really annoyed with clark s character  no expertise what so ever except medical and constantly making excuse for every overly stupid decision and still be accepted and obeyed from others ps  the show is good fun though  may be with some annoyed characters  firstly  i ticked the spoilers box as  while my whingeing is not specific  it may give away some ideas to those that are yet to watch this the concept of this series was great  the premise a little  dodgy  but we will live with it  and the execution was well attempted by all the writing  however  drove me nuts  the show could have easily been called  the   bad and ill timed decisions   in attempting to heighten prolong the drama  characters would make such stupid game changing decisions  forcing me to smack my forehead in frustration throughout the series someone in charge set this show to    conflict and    angst  not to mention    female on female action   and all manner of shenanigans ensued to maintain that level loyalty switching was all the rage   i cannot say   like they changed their underwear   because grounders probably go commando  there were various timely yet ill advised massacres to ensure that peace existed only during the ad breaks there were several cliff hanger countdown moments that were missed due to lengthy hand wringing and  hey  we know that time is running out but let us pull dramatic faces and talk about it some more  a sprinkling of common sense decisions would have made this so much more enjoyable i should mention the good stuff before i run out of puff  ricky whittle as lincoln gets top marks for the grounder torn between two cultures  alycia debnam carey nailed the role of lexa  all that violence in such a cute package  in conclusion  this is a very watchable drama but viewers will understand my frustrations as it unfolds   a science fiction series about teenagers sent on earth to examine if it has   it is finally livable again after a nuclear apocalypse that happened almost   years ago and forced the survivors to live in space stations  in the beginning of season    the   was basically a cheesy teen show  but then at some point the tone changed  and season   was what it could have been as its best  a show that explores what is morally right and wrong when you are desperate to survive  how far can you go and still be deserving of surviving  there was still unintended melodramatic tackiness in it  but it was going to the right direction but instead of continuing with this tone and enhancing and deepening the morality aspect  they decided in season   to go for a shock value road  traumatic things just happen now to characters but they are never really explored  they build up tension  then there has   there is the shocking moment  and then it has   it is ignored  viewers do not get a satisfying emotional payoff for the suspense it has   it is like the writers are fixated serving  unexpected  shock value moments after another  i write  unexpected   because in reality they are just repeating story lines and doing do overs from a slightly different ankle  unexpected deaths become expected deaths  especially if you are a love interest for one of the main characters   the writers do not seem to care that much  what these traumatic moments and hardships would actually do to a person and how that should affect the writing of these characters in the long run  it has   it is forgotten or it has   it is explained away with an off screen development  or you can just write that chip in the character s head made the character do it  so does it even matter what they did  said etc  things just happen because they happen  because it has   it is  shocking   because  you do not see it coming   because it has   it is  surprising     the morality aspect and the emotional effects are wiped away  basically whatever the characters do  they just write them to parrot   it has   it is us against them  i had to do it  you had to do it  my people  my people  my people  for our people  no deeper push or a meaning is needed for a genocide  no deeper meaning is needed for wanting your sibling suddenly to die  no deeper meaning is needed to torture someone etc  even child abuse is presented simply as a way to protect that child  because the child is  my people  us against them  i torture my child  so no one else can use her etc    and then it has   it is ignored  everything is fine again  it has   it is very cheap writing  characters become just soulless plot devices who never stop to think or feel or reflect what has   what is happening and what are they doing  they just do whatever they have to while repeating those same old catchphrases like brain dead robots there is also no reason to trust any character development you think you see on the screen  because the writers seem to get fed up easily with previously written character arcs  so the characters and relationships are basically rewritten in every season  it has   it is really odd that also the relationships form  as a surprise   the writers seem to think that it would be boring  if there has   there is actual on screen development and the viewers would see the relationships evolving  it has to be a shock and a surprise too but anyways  by season   you do not even recognize the characters anymore  i guess it has   it is fun for the writers and the actors  as they get to do something new and play a different character every season  but this leads viewers to feel detached  there is no continuation or coherence in the storytelling  the characters do not learn anything  it has   it is like they forget what they have experienced  they repeat the same things or are continuously unable to see the other side  even though they have self experienced that other side  and when viewers become more and more detached because of this poor and lazy writing  it leads to a realization that you do not even care who survives anymore  which is pretty bad if you are watching a survival show the choice to mix up relationships  dynamics and even personalities and writing the characters to betray someone just because suddenly  my people  is different than previously  makes all their bonds seem meaningless  one moment they are friends and the next moment they torture each other  betray each other  leave each other to die etc  and again these things are ignored  they just write a fast and easy fix to start a new plot with new dynamics  viewers do not get t',\n",
       "  'o see the effects of betrayals on their relationships characters do not really discuss about these things either  the dialogue becomes more and more shallow and by season   characters basically just repeat already used catchphrases  it has   it is very hard to sell these relationships as something true and deep  when characters do not ever really seem to talk honestly and directly with each other  how can you claim that your main characters are soul mates and best friends  when you do not write them to talk to each other it has   it is so odd it becomes extremely funny when the characters have their most  meaningful  discussions through middle hands  they use for example the other one s child or the other one s significant other as messengers  or even a dead girlfriend who talks through the head of the other one s child  whatever it takes to avoid an actual direct conversation  i guess  for some reason the writers just do not want to let their own main characters  who are supposed to be best friends  to talk to each other  weir  weird  weird so it has   it is a very  very plot driven show  which is kind of ironic  bc there has   there is also a lot of plot holes in it  and because the writers have such an urge to invent something new all the time  it has   it is predictable nonsense most of the time  and reinvent the characters  all the twists and turns and shocks feel very forced if you pay closer attention to them  so even a plot driven viewer needs to ignore quite a lot of stuff to enjoy it  when the pace is quick enough  i guess ignoring is possible  but when there has   there is time to reflect what actually was shown  you probably start to feel like someone thinks you are a very stupid viewer to write something like this and thinking it has   it is good enough for a viewer who enjoys watching the development of the characters  it becomes a very frustrating show  if you like to understand the characters  get to know how they think and feel  and how situations effect them  this is definitely not a show for you  it may need a few episodes for you to get hooked  but afterwards  you´ll just want more entwined in a scifi environment  love affairs  betrayal  loyalty  politics  science  religion  action    all come to this wonderful mix sure some parts are a little far fetched  but hey  its pure entertainment tv have fun  it started out ok  got interesting and then every season is the same thing    over and over again     simply put  it is like watching   different shows  approximately   seasons each seasons           quiet a nice show  full of action  drama  surprises  and unpredictability seasons           as you go further in the series it becomes total opposite  full of dumb fiction that is only fitted to make the main characters  clarke   bellamy  who by the way happen to be the top   annoying characters in this show ever my advice  either watch until end of season   or do not watch it all  spoiler alert    in case you plan on watching passed season    to the point that towards the end of it you shall   you will be rooting and hoping that they die especially when clarke was so close to  however as boring and predictable it is the writer saved clarke over and over with so many ridiculous ways including surviving a brain wipe  death by root plants while hidden in a secret hatch  and a magical cpr by bellamy that revives her  brain  haha what is very clear  is that the worse thing about this show was the writers what is not clear  is why depressing characters that had so much potential and were fan favorite like octavia  and even killing off characters earlier on that could have had much better role and added much better story in the series such as lincoln  finn of course in the end  the go to another planet  kill an entire civilization and win every obstacle against all odds  by any means without losing any of the main characters  unless you count abby as main character  and yet clarke  bellamy  madi  all alive and well  only characters that we were happy to see alive were octavia  who was killed in last scene  and murphy even though they turned both of them into puppies in the last season to help clarke and bellamy bottom line  one of those series that started well the writers started to run out of good idea so kept going with crappy ideas  a total waste to watch past   seasons i have to say it started a bit weak  but now i am completely addicted  yes there are some cringe worth moments  but give it a go    the last episode was a complete turning point  and i personally cannot wait for the next episode i remember how boring the vampire diaries was at the beginning and now it is one of the most addictive shows ever    who knows maybe the   will be the same i was quite surprised with the fact that a show like the tomorrow people is still on the air  and also that it got distributed to the uk  i started watching it  and i literary could not take it anymore after   or   episodes    horribly acted  the acting in this show its quite good  i find the characters on this show a lot more interesting  probably because they are criminals  so you kinda want to know what each of them did it also have that element of uncertainty that shows like the vampire diaries  teen wolf or the originals have  where even the main characters can be killed off  which makes the show even more interesting  so i hope it gets enough viewers to keep it going  if you combine almost every stereotypical post apocalyptic cliches   and then added bad acting  disappointing meaningless deaths and then add   this is war  or  we are at war  a million times  then you get   the    you shall   you will be annoyed with high school type teen drama  and you shall   you will also be yelling at major characters especially clarke  but you shall   you will still want to watch it though  ok  so I am not going to waffle on about how bad the script is and how many plot holes there are to this show as i think from a run through of a number of reviews on this site    that bit is covered it has   it is not great but what i am starting to see coming through is a fairly sincere interlacing storyline between what is happening on the ark  the big space station with the last of the humans on it  and those dumped back on earth bottom line is that it has   it is entertaining  and it is getting better too  there are even moments which remind me of battlestar galactica  the remade series  not the original  as resources on the ark start to dwindle and decisions have to be made I am enjoying it  and i think that anyone else who likes to watch throw away tv and just be entertained will enjoy it too if i have any concerns about this show it has   it is that it has   it is a little bit too  high school  to start with and i do not see how this is going to last beyond a single series as the current plot  barring any miracles  pretty much means anyone left in space after a few months is dead I am just going to enjoy this for as long as it lasts and ignore the haters of which there appear to be many    the first two episodes have piqued my interest so far and are good sci fi  it has   it is a best series out there right now  and it has   it is the only current one I have watched lately  i just hope it does not have too many moral twists in it  but going back to watch ones that do is the norm too I am also in my late   so that  contrary to those negative and even fallacious reviews of the show claiming it has   it is a    remake  or  reviews use poor grammar   even  positive reviews are written by idiots or teenagers    the    has the potential to continue as good sci fi  and good  positive reviews abound  you have got to populate your premise  and it has   it is a new twist on an adam and eve or genesis along the lines  earth     and it has   it is a scenario that includes adult characters as well  moreover  as at least one other review has said   the    even has some of the actors from  lost  in the cast  the premise is already bad  it has   it is post apocalyptic scifi getting the young adult treatment  the show is yet another attempt to cash in on the twilight formula of taking what used to be nerd fodder  fantasy  horror  sci fi  and turning it into teenage highschool drama nonsense in addition to that  the show asks us to ignore massive internal contradictions that turn the whole premise into a joke pretty much  it has   it is bad writing in addition to bad acting    we are supposed to believe that the powers to be that preside over the last remnants of humanity    people  would willingly send a sizable number of healthy  attractive breeding age females to almost certain death  that does not appear to be a particularly good idea if the survival of the species is the goal    we are supposed to believe that they would send their young and healthy to earth  i e  into mortal danger  because of resource constraints  rather than the old and sick or other non essential persons    we are supposed to believe that  unless you are a minor  even small infractions carry a death sentence  even though it would be highly likely that virtually everyone on such a space station would need to have very specific tasks requiring a very specific skill set   making such a scenario highly unlikely    we are supposed to believe that  after   generations on a resource constrained space station  there is still plenty of shaving supplies  eyeliner  mascara and so on so that everyone can look like a perfectly groomed fashion catalog model    we are supposed to believe that out of a total population of   there are   juvenile delinquents     we are supposed to believe that they have the technology to monitor life signs in real time from space but they do not even have a single geiger counter to measure radioactive radiation    we are supposed to believe that the  delinquents   after growing up in what one must assume to be a highly reglemented society  would go lord of the flies pretty much the very minute they touch down on earth i could continue this list  but it has   it is pointless  the whole thing is a complete mess  i was not at all into this genre of tv shows movies  more into the comedies  so i was randomly browsing netflix and started watching the    and what can i say   i got hooked to it the show has a good plot to start with and now has multiple story lines  I am talking about season     i hope it has   it is not a spoiler   which makes me more curious to know what has   what is about to happen next it might seem like it has   it is a teen thing   but once you realize how all the characters grow with time and how they blend with the plot it has   it is pretty entertaining  and i personally think the makers did a good casting and most of them are doing good at acting their roles  though i feel raven overacts at times so in a nutshell  the   seems to be a on good start as they proceeded to season    i hope they will make their storyline more interesting and mature the characters further  just amazing and wonderful  could not ask for a better show this show is unimaginably stupid  the only thing that amazes me more than the fact that it was renewed for a second season is the fact that some people actually consider this science fiction  with their laughable portrayal of conditional gravity in orbit and magic radiation on the surface of the planet  the writers appear to harbor not only ignorance but an active disdain for basic science  the list of plot holes in this show is unending  the writers seem to delight in throwing them out there just to see if the audience is even paying enough attention to catch them or is too distracted by paige turco s holographic eye mascara the character development can best be described as  schizophrenic   the writers  idea of depth of character is turning antagonists into protagonists and back again sometimes within the span of single episodes  half the actors appear embarrassed to be part of such an illogical piece of teen drama crap and the other half are just excited to have a job  but what more do you expect from cw there is nothing to like about this show  i fear for the intelligence of reviewers who advise turning a blind eye to plot holes and terrible writing  you have to be a certain type easily entertained simpleton to find the   a show worth watching for your benefit  and as a response to the naive positive reviews  I have listed just a few of the most glaring holes and general problems with the plot below  unless you are particularly skilled at suspending disbelief to the point of completely shutting off your brain  this show is not for you    portions of the ark are rotating presumably to provide artificial gravity  a concept the artists at least peripherally understood but the script writers do not  one scene in   even involves turning gravity on and off like a light bulb     solar radiation in low earth orbit is not the same as nuclear radiation from thermonuclear weapons detonations  nuclear radiation from weapons detonations dissipates over the course of weeks  which is why nagasaki is currently inhabited by half a million people  for example      even with exposure to the most intense radiation at chernobyl  the type of instantaneous tissue damage and death from fallout radiation shown in the series is not even close to being realistic  it is apparent that the writers have absolutely no idea what radiation actually is     blood transfusions are not going to magically protect tissue from nuclear radiation       years is not long enough for natural selection to evolve a population of humans     strong which is    resistant to anything     if there has   there is still enough magic radiation on the surface to instantly kill people  why did the ark decide to wait almost   years before sending people down since it would not have made a difference either way     they seem to do just fine consistently treating stab wounds  broken bones  concussions  etc  without any medical supplies or training to speak of and with a    success rate and an average recovery time of a day or so     how could a nuclear war have succeeded in destroying not only all traces of technology but all traces of written language on the surface of the planet such that the majority of surviving humanity would be reverted some tens of thousands of years  that has   that is right  tens of thousands  we have had agriculture for the last     years     the   happens upon a cache of automatic weapons after having been on the ground for what  a week  meanwhile  the people who have been living on the ground for the last century have given up on technology and are throwing spe',\n",
       "  'ars at one another and riding horses around     why did the  grounders   stupid name  bother to invent a new pidgin english language if they all still speak common english fluently and without even so much as an accent  the premise for the show is actually good  a great idea that could have been a great show  but  the    completely fails with the execution  it is nothing but a hormone infested high school drama masked as a sci fi show    kids are sent to a previous radioactive unlivable earth to determine if the planet is suitable for life again  great idea right  but what has   what is the first thing these kids do when they get there  separate into groups of who has   who is cool and who is not  while anyone speaking reason that they need to find shelter food anything else required to survive  are just bullied and threatened with their life  as well as the normal pointless  girl likes class clown guy who likes the girl that is serious and will not pay attention to him   it has   it is a joke how silly this is  you are the first people to step foot on earth in   years and you just want to fight amongst yourselves about who has   who is cool and who gets the girl  save yourself an hour and do not watch it  the reason why I am writing this review is because i see so many negative ones  true  the first few episodes were odd  and had their problems  but the following episodes cleared things up a lot  and also developed the whole thing  this show did not start out too well  some concepts were odd  like the technological inconsistencies  however  as you learn more about the ark  it becomes obvious that the resource situation is hard  make up  well  most shows suffer from everyone having make up  when they shouldn t  it has   it is a tv thing  what is important is the story  what i like about it is how the teens on earth are still teens  they have their love life and general angst  but they are also trying to be adults  sometimes it has   it is almost  lord of the flies   but then the characters stiffen their spine and make the hard choices  in a way  it has   it is like a study of society and people  though times sometimes bring out the worst or the best in people  with all the hormones coursing through their young bodies  it has   it is even worse  one thing is for sure with this show  it has   it is not boring  do not understand the hate  great story  a bit of a roller coaster i have to admit that i created imdb account just to rate this show after watching it  hello everyone  i have to say that i really really love the series  especially  i love the couple barney robin so bad  i learnt a lot from the gang and i really love them  i cried with them  i laughed with them  spend every moment with them  really  i cried a lot when marshall s dad died  and when tracy died  i was broken    and i had a quite tough day after  i used to think that the season ninth may be the season that i like the most  but turned out  i was wrong    the moment robin said   we got divorced  made me cry     i do not know if I am a sensitive person  but i cried a lot  and then when ted stood under robin s apartment  holding the f  king blue french horn   i was totally speechless  i spent a whole day after cursing the directors  i really did that     all i can say is that i was totally disappointed by the end of the series  but after all  we cannot forget the contain just because of the ending  so i decided to see the episode   is the end  or at least the last five minutes were just pretending  anyway  thanks for reading this  i love this show   it has   it is one of the best sitcoms on the air and one of the best cbs shows    i disagree with the other comment   barney is the best character  he has   he is the funniest person on the show  i love how the entire ensemble has chemistry together   it actually feels like they are friends in real life  and i do not think they need new writers  they just need to grow a little more  this show gets better with time  i laugh so hard with the show that my sides hurt every time i watch  i recommend this show to anyone that has a great sense of humor and wants to laugh until their sides hurt  i hope that this show has a long run on the air  spoilers      i think too many people took the title of the show too seriously  a lot of people wondered why ted decided to sit down and tell his kids a story about meeting their mother which included his ex girlfriends  well without some of the girlfriends  he would not have grown and become the man he did  he also would not have lucked into the opportunity of meeting their mother  and without those stories we would have not had a tv show  the show has a great combination of funny and heartfelt moments going on that I have only seen matched with friends and scrubs  there were some episodes along the way in season     that were forgettable but a lot of shows get like that when they are on past their prime  now that i know the full story and that ted ends up with robin  i want to watch the entire series over  to me it makes perfect sense to end the show the way they did  because robin was a main character to the story and not necessarily so with tracy  it was clear through most of the series that robin was the one that got away from ted and the one that had the biggest impact on him  robin helped make ted into the man that the kids saw and helped shape him into the man that would fall in love with their mother  barney s story was also very interesting  a lot of people felt that the writers undid all of his development in one show  the thing i like about what they did  was that it felt real  barney s character was complex  he had been let down throughout his life and had his own very deep seeded psychological problems  those were not necessarily gone by the time he married robin  i think they were still within him  hence the jokes that he was still able to make about other women s boobs and so on  the thing barney gained from his relationship with robin was that she helped him love someone  she helped him see that he was capable of doing so  little by little  nora  then quinn  then robin helped barney see that he was capable of more  i think barney was heartbroken by his marriage with robin  he felt that it was going to be a certain way  he was as excited if not more excited than her to be married to each other  hence his nervousness leading up to the wedding and how perfect he wanted it to be  i just think that he could not handle what their relationship was becoming kind of like the first go around  he loved her too much to lie to her  but he learned how to love and become a bit more stable  his   day spree after his divorce was more about him going to a dark place than it was about him wanting to be that guy  the other thing is that robin never would have been able to give barney a child  his daughter was the love of his life and i found that sweet  she changed him forever  going back to ted and robin  what people might forget is that present ted is telling the story and not past ted  people felt like he was not genuine in his love for the mother tracy  i think he loved her with every ounce of his heart  present ted was   years removed from his wife s death  he wanted to tell his kids the story of how he met the most incredible woman of his life  the only problem was that there was more than one woman that had that effect on him  he just did not realize the effect robin still had on him and how important she was to him  his kids helped him realize that  he was not the only person in the story who loved multiple people  robin fell in love with two different men and tracy had fallen in love with max before ted  the show was very real in that sense  so to sum it up  the mother was a macguffin but a very beautiful one and one that helped the story have a direction  the last scene b w the mother and ted where they finally met was beautifully written and acted  and the final scene to me has not stopped running through my head  the music hit  and robin brought out the romantic side of ted again  no words needed to be spoken there and I am happy for that  we all knew and in the end i was happy b c these fantastic characters that I have come to love were all in a better place  I have enjoyed the first few episodes of this post  friends  comedy  it really captures some of the humorous albeit awkward situations that late twenty somethings are finding themselves in these days alyson hannigan once again presents her hilarious  quirky sense of style and humor  along with her boyfriend  marshall  they are an excellent representation of the couple who are trying to figure out an identity in the  not still partying like college kids  but trying not to be all grown up  stage of life the lead character  ted  provides great entertainment  audiences will be drawn in by his sensitivity and likability  he has   he is not desperate to get married  but merely ready to find the one  tired of game playing overall  i think this is a half hour well spent  the humor is edgy  unpredictable  and you will find yourself reminiscing about those first few years after you graduated from college and struggled to find yourself out in the  real world   i do not know if i have enough to say to fill up ten lines  i basically wanted to say that i think this is a funny show  and i hope the network keeps it  i especially like the twists and sense of mystery I have liked alyson hannigan for quite a while  and i think she has   he is doing a great job in the first adult role I have seen her in  i cannot believe she has   he is already     i also think doogie  i mean neil patrick harris  plays his character really well  if you have not seen him in  harold   kumar go to white castle   you should  josh radnor also does a very good job in his first leading role i agree that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion  but i think this show has a lot of elements that make a good series  good plot  good writing  good acting  and attractive cast   i think previous series like  friends  have raised the bar very high for new sitcoms  but i hope that even if a series is not destined to become the next  friends   it can still be recognized as a good and worthwhile sitcom  watched the show  thought  hm  i have not decided if it shall   it will stay or not   but then the next day  my husband and i are quoting it and want to watch it again  we try again the next week  again with the quoting  i have not watched a show where there are lines that stick with me like this for a very long time  the show would not be anywhere without  barney   but somehow none of its faults matter because i enjoy it just too darn much  every episode there has   there is a new line  have not been disappointed so far  hoping it continues and gets even better i mean come on  with lines like   suit up    phone five    not awkward guys  its only awkward if we make it awkward and the numerous variations of  suit up  are a hoot  snow suit up    flight suit up  i gotta say  i just enjoy it  there is not great philosophy  it has a laugh track  but i do not miss it and end up watching the episode a couple times because its the only things worth watching sometimes  how i met your mother is so worth watching  what great characters and amazing writing  this show is a hit  finally something to tune in to on monday nights  not since friends have the characters on a sit com bonded like this  i love that there are   guys and   girls  the writing is fresh and in control and productive     i particularly enjoy the ted with the shirt episode   what a unique story line and all the characters just seem to work so well together  i love the added suspense of  who is ted going to end up with   the character of ted does an amazing job  he has such a cuteness and innocence about him that makes the whole premise of  how i met your mother  really work and keeps the audience so tuned in to find out what is going to happen next  you have accumulated such a great staff of writers    amazing new show  our office is taking turns staging monday night soirees to watch  this premise really works  keep us the good work  keep monday night tv rolling along  yeah   hilarious  first of all  to everyone raging how they hated the ending  come on people  it is a tv show  for crying out loud  get over it for me the ending was brilliant  at least it explains ted s twisted story telling and why it took   seasons before we actually got to meet the mother  and true  it was sad that she dies  but marshall s dad also passed away  which i found way more depressing  having ted show up at robins apartment with the blue horn was bittersweet and basically brought it to a full circle  barney finally committed to a female who will turn out awesome  when she grows up  marshall and lily are the perfect couple as you always knew they would be i congratulate craig thomas and carter bays for having the courage to not end himym like any mediocre sitcom would and want to thank them for almost a decade filled with laughter and sometimes tears  sometimes both at the same time  because the characters they created felt multi layered and so real at times you wished they were actual friends you could hang out with at maclaren s pub  it never got boring to watch  even if ted seems a bit whiny sometimes and when re watching the show you finally notice that lily is a bitch  having said that I had   I would like to send a virtual high five to everyone involved in making this show  it was legen     wait for it    dary  what can i say about this show  the cast is awesome  the writers rock  the show is great  my favorite character is barney  he is probably the main person i watch the show for  he is funny and brings a certain  something  to tv that it needs  it is totally the best new comedy in awhile  while it does have a laugh track   it is not needed  bob sagget is right at home on this show playing the dad  i think it is very fitting for him to be playing that role  the rest of the cast is great also  the guy who plays ted is great at being the  every day  guy and marshall and his soon to be wife  lilly are perfect together  as for robin  well she is robin and there is nothing wrong with her  i think everyone on this show including the regular cab driver are great  this show has everything and i hope everyone gives it a chance  i love it  it is legendary  till next week barney  greetings i know it has   it is weird  but i have to confess it  maybe I am not the first guy who confess his thoughts about himym first of all  i want to thank for everything it has   it is taught me  first time i watched h',\n",
       "  'ow i met your mother tv show  some thoughts are started to appear in my mind  it has   it is very strange to tell  i do not really know how to start or how to describe it  it has   it is like panic attack  you cannot describe it too  you know  but these thoughts are good  i started watching in    as you know start day is september       if i remember true  i started on october  anyway  i have no idea what will happen in this show in the future  i have never expecting to watch it for the last episode  this show is different then others  it has   it is teaching many things to it has   it is followers  friendship  love  kindness  sacrifice  generosity et cetera and et cetera to tell you the truth  i did not establish a deep friendship until now  i tried too much  but why is it not work  really i do not know  i do not know  ted  barney  marshall  robin and lily taught me too much things about friendship  love  kindness  sacrifice  generosity  i learned more  until now  i learned that there are too many things that i must learn  you look like you have too much free time in my country  but in the end  there is a free time they seen but you have not  and they are steal your free time for nothing    instead of this  i can travel to more country  and learn more  i can work more  more and more for me and my family  friends    it has   it is started eat my mind anyway  as i said  i have watched how i met your mother too many times  and this show  these cast and the team  who are stayed background  taught me too many things  I am still continuing to watch this show on tv  even i realized that  i have to own bundle box of this show  i found a site  and i will buy this bundle maybe you said   i do not understand why you are yelling   believe me  there are some things that can hurt  himym helped recognize myself  i believe that  all of these main cast is reflects an idea  ted is ambitious for his dreams  if you believe  you can do anything  barney is looks like lecher  but he is not  just like ted  he is looking for a door to happiness  lily  ah she is adorable and interesting person  but she is very professional to hide her thoughts   robin is unperturbed  but she is very professional just like lily  she is hiding her good feelings during some situations  marshall is childish  and this is a virtue too as you see  i discovered these emotions in these characters  all of them was a very good lesson for me  always be an ambitious  and release your emotions while reaching to these dreams  but at the same time  be lecher for your dreams  do interesting things and do not listen see what people talking about yourself about these situations  and of course  do not forget to do some childish things  this will make you happy thanks for reading  and best regards to how i met your mother tv show cast and the team  of course  excellent series to waste some time  perfect for the romantic souls  the story is about five friends and their love adventures  mixed up with tons of funny stories  ted is a lonely guy  who wants to make a family  but the girl he loves does not want a serious relationship and keeps cutting off his attempts to win her heart  marshal and lilly are ted s best friends they are together for   years and are planning a wedding with all the consequences coming from that  barny is the casanova of the company  he has   he is funny and arrogant in a very humouristic way  the director s method s are different and will keep your attention in these cute series  when  how i met your mother  first appeared on the small screen  i refused to watch it  but then i watched an episode  i think it was episode   when they went to a club  and a thought it was pretty funny  i must admit that the new show is not laugh out loud  slap your knee hilarious   but it has potential to be great  every character in the cbs show    in total  are likable but i must give extra kudos to the characters played by alyson hannigan  lily   and neil patrick harris  barney   i may be biased towards my liking of alyson hannigan s lily  due to her previous comedic roles  american pie series  and buffy the vampire slayer  but she brings a charm and charismatic flair to the show  also neil patrick harris  barney is great    he basically plays a creep which I am sure everyone is familiar with  because i know i sure am    i find barney hilarious    he is that creepy guy at the club but that has   that is what makes him lovable all in all this show has potential  as long as the stories  acting and writing keep up then i am definitely going to tune in  i think once people start getting to know the characters better  they shall   they will start tuning in as well  everyone always compares this show to  friends  which did not really get popular until after the first season  hopefully  this show will continue to be funny and exceed our expectations  but watch it  well  if you just look at the title  its most likely you would think its some crappy show that will probably be cancelled the first season for being extremely lame and incredibly boring  honestly  i felt this way about this show when i saw what it was going to be called   how i met your mother   come on  thats what most people would expect well  if people gave it a chance  its actually a really cute and hilarious sitcom about the main character ted pondering on his love life and looking for  the one   josh radnor I have never heard of before  but i really do like his humor in the show  it has   it is a strange kind of humor to me though  almost dry humor  the supporting characters give great comedy to the show  esp  neil patrick harris  character barney   who has   who is my favorite character in the show   man  his character cracked me up in the pilot  i laughed continuously when everyone kept on dismissing his ideal of them all wearing suits  its great that doogie finally comes back to television in a great new series  their are other great characters i feel give great comedy to the show such as the couple lily  alyson hannigan  and marshall  jason segal  who make a great team  they have those romantic  but hilarious scenes together where you have those laugh out loud moments  then you finally have robin  cobie smulders  who is seen as  the one  at first  but turns out to not actually be ted s future wife  she has her funny moments  but i do not really see her as funny as the rest of the characters thats basically what people need to know about this show  most of the actors we have never heard of and have not seen in movies or shows in awhile  but this is great stardom for them  it has   it is a great show for everyone to watch for it has great comedy and writing to it  it has   it is nothing really what i expected though when i saw the previews for the pilot  just give this show a chance  you will not be disappointed  it def  has a potential to last some more seasons  i do not have much in the way of a review other than to say that based on the pilot  i think this show has a lot of potential to be a really good show  the cast is funny and endearing and the premise is fun  it might not be the most original idea for the show  think wonder years  but it has it has   it is own little twist that should make for some interesting episodes  hopefully next weeks episode will be just as watchable and entertaining  if you have not checked it out  i recommend that you do  alyson hannigan and neil patrick harris are the perfect complements to the show  the rest of the cast is somewhat unfamiliar to me though i must admit  i recall seeing jason segel in freaks and geeks  but i have not really seen him in anything as impressive since so hopefully he shall   he will bring the same originality he showed as nick to his new character  marshall  josh radnor is the newcomer in the bunch and he is just perfect for the part  he has   he is cute yet dorky  with a lovable charm that will certainly endear him to many female viewers  i see only good things on the horizon for this show and i hope it finds a permanent home at cbs  the perfect amount of drama and comedy every character is perfectly developed and very rarely go outside of their core personality  i have seen every single episode and can say that our of   of them i might not have liked maybe    all the other episodes are captivating  unexpected  funny  accurate  realistic  full of positivity  and after you have seen all of them in the end you shall   you will be a little bit better as a person  at least that has   that is what it did for me  this review will fall into two pieces  inspired by the latest   episodes   seriously guys  what the f    is going on with the musical bits and ridiculous rhyming  until season    somewhere mid season    some of the best comedy i have ever seen  hilarious  right on the spot  with great one liners and characters  absolutely wonderful anything after that  what the f    went wrong  lame jokes  terrible musical bits  awful dialogue  just plain awful tv  and yet somehow  i am still watching  just to see the last episode  com  on guys  this should have finished     seasons ago  on your epic legendary peakness thanks for all the wonderful laughs  but wow  you really overstayed your stay   i loved this show  unfortunately  the ninth series is increasingly putting the past tense into that statement  the whole nonsense of having marshall travelling rather than present is tedious  and he really is important to the group chemistry  which is increasingly unbalanced  the flashbacks are getting contradictory  dragging out   days into a whole series is just stupid it is still watchable  but there is none of the magic or the emotional investment that has been present in the first   series  and now we have seen the mother and having her as a permanent recurring cast member  why cannot we just write her in properly and get on with having ted meet her   how i met your mother is definitely one of the best american sitcom  it is the funniest dramas with eccentric humor i have ever seen  the producers of this comedy  carter bays and craig thomas  created an entertaining romantic story full of awkward and amusing moments  so i have not one bad word to say about it  this comedy  with interesting plot and irresistible characters  is certainly my favorite the story is about the adventures of architect ted mosby and his friends  and how he met the mother of his children  however  the comedy is not similar to a traditional love story  which begins from the moment when the romantic leads first meet each other  the structure of this drama is absolutely unique  ted mosby does not introduce his wife until the final season  additionally  the series start with ted retelling to his children in   the story about how he was so close to meet their mother  he had been seeking his love for   years  ted failed a lot  but his crazy friends every time provided him social and emotional support  with a lovely couple marshall eriksen and lily aldrin  womanizer barney sticnson with a secret job  you also will find out it only in the final season  and funny anchor robin sharbatsky  ted has unforgettable adventures and a number of ridiculous stories how i met your mother is suitable for everyone  it has   it is a really positive  humorous and amazing comedy  which you can watch with your friends and with your family as well  however  parents need to know that this comedy focuses on flirting  love and relationships  includes sexual jokes and some vulgar language  on the other hand  some obscene things are substituted with interesting activities  and it makes stories more comical  at the same time this drama has controversial ending  which suggests that sometimes life has no happy endings  overall it has   it is easy watching sitcom with different funny story lines  so you will never be bored  i love that they gave aly a new show  she is so great and she deserves one  they stuck with the  kinky girl  persona the movie american pie gave her  but i still like it  the show is funny and the characters are great  i cannot wait to see who ted ends up with  the tv show may be a little silly at times  but i like it a lot  and i intend to watch it every monday night  i do not know if the show can have multiple seasons since it has   it is a one story type of thing  but if they can figure out how to do it  then i hope they do it  anyways  i give high praises to the show  and i hope it sticks around longer than some of these other tv series  like head cases  kandis how can i say it respectfully  hmm     it has   it is disgustingly boring and insultingly illogical i admit that season   and   were extremely well made  maybe it is the reason why i am now extremely disappointed  the writers only uses tricks of  sudden turns of events  to generate funny moments  having watched many episodes of this show  all i see is that characters constantly changing their beliefs  decisions  and actions back and forth without any logical reasons  we two must break up  no  we must get back together  no  that has   that is just impulse  we should still break up  no  that has   that is true love  we must get back together  no  it has   it is true love because we wanted it to be  we should break up       the show is not making too much sense now  the five figures in the show do not have consistent characters any more  you can not ask such questions   how could this person possibly do such a thing   because you will not have any logical answers  maybe this is exactly what american shows are about  like fast food  you do not need to enjoy it  just swallow what is given to you  sometimes  you stop and think  wait a minute  this does not make sense  does not xx just did something exactly the opposite a minute ago   no  you cannot  the writers just throw to you another contradictory joke and you are moving on i feel deeply insulted watching the show  i feel that the writers assume that audience never think deeper than the superficial meaning of the jokes while watching shows  which is not true deeply disappointed  one of the greatest mysteries of this universe is how this show got sooo popular  people who love this show act as if f r i e n d s never existed  this show is a terrible rip off of  friends  and i am insulting friends by comparing himym with it  i mean c mon     the jokes are predictable and lame  the situations are kiddish  the characters live in a world of their own the story never seems to move on  they give stupid names to each and everything  the way   year olds do     eg  lets pull out the  mosby   I have won the  three way belt  etc  etc   I have watched each and every episode of the show',\n",
       "  ' till date and have not laughed even once  smiled maybe but never laughed    whereas in shows like there big bang theory  friends  seinfeld    i fall off my chair laughing at least once even if it is the nth time i am watching the episode    the only good thing about the show is barney aka neil patrick harris  probably the only reason i did watch every episode    otherwise the show is totally lame    i give it     only because of him  when i first heard of this show i was like  hmm  this could be interesting    but no  it sucks  i first saw it in my girlfriends house  and thought  wow  this is actually pretty entertaining  but then i began to think about the jokes  the characters    and the only thing that came into my mind was  friends    omg  this is a copy of friends     i thought  and i was right  it has   it is the exact same thing  the jokes the scenario the characters attitude and their friendship  it has   it is all there   now tell me  why would they make a reboot of the   s show  because it sells  so why watch it  just to prove my point i made a list of things that we have seen in  friends  and that are similar in  how i met your mother   maclaren s pub   central perk monica   chandler lily   marshallrachel   ross date   robin   ted daterachel   joey date   robin barney datejoey s a womanizer   barney is a womanizer barney and phoebe do not know who their dad is  both have been lied by their mother grandmother respectively ross   ted both end up as professors emily did not want rachel to be around ross   stella with robin  and the list goes on   so that has   that is that   how i met you are mother  is like a show made for kids  it has stupid childish jokes  it has loving clichéd characters  and it has a moral in the end of every episode  to give us that worm feeling that everything is going to be alright    man this show is the basic form of a us comedy  it always has been this way  and it will stay this way until people realize that sh t like this is boring  repetitive and simple has hell  kinda like pop music these days  but that has   that is another story    this really is the most awful show  clichéd writing and amateurish performances makes this a decidedly disappointing viewing experience  time to bring it all to an end and move on to something watchable the situations are poor and the execution of them is laboured  it is almost as though a team of writers have come together to think up the most obvious  in your face  situations and have then proceeded script them  one of the disadvantages of teams of scriptwriters on a show is that the ideas pass through a committee stage and most of the good ones do not get through if it were not for the us the office i would award this the worst comedy ever  i had heard from several people that this show was  amazing    funny   and any number of other wonderful adjectives  so  why had i never heard of it  it has been running since   after all  and this is   years later  well  netflix supplied the answer with   episodes of the most recycled  predictable garbage i have ever seen on television  i did not laugh a single time  accurately predicting almost every encounter in the first few seconds and staring at the screen in baffled wonderment  how is this show popular   this show is essentially the prime example of our american pursuit of laziness  we do not dare watch a show that challenges our thinking or is interesting in any way  we just want to watch the same crap that has been on tv since the first fart joke debuted i digress    this show was trashy  boring  insulting to the intelligence of a kindergartner  and poorly executed at that  in short  an epic piece of utter trash that i will avoid at all costs in the future  others are of course entitled to their opinions  but for those unsure if they had   they would like to take a chance on it  do not  i would sincerely rather watch an infomercial  it would be funnier  in    gloria monty along with other general hospital writers decided to make a couple out of two actors that had amazing chemistry   genie francis and tony geary who have become the phenomenal luke and laura   luke and laura made general hospital the unforgettable soap opera it is  and still today  luke and laura s though painful relationship  keeps viewers going through their fascinating characterization and never ending passion between them alan and monica  played by leslie charleson and stuart damon  frisco and felicia  played by jack and kristina wagner  robert and holly  played by tristan rogers and emma samms  sonny and brenda  played by maurice bernard and vanessa marcil  and luke and laura have showed every other soap opera the definition of a  love story    though never simple  always intense  always unforgettable general hospital has also shown amazing technique in storylines that are not love stories   such as monica quartermaine s heartwrenching breast cancer storyline in    or the amazing storyline of two little girls dying  yet only one miracle came out of it   i could only be talking about bobbie spencer s and tony jones s daughter bj giving her heart to frisco and felicia s daughter maxie  in the last moments to save her life   these stories touched many viewers and there are so many more some of the most precious moments on daytime television have occurred on general hospital  and the highest rated moment on daytime television was luke and laura s wedding in     it was said to be the only wedding ever to rival princess diana s   general hospital has created feelings  storylines  and characters that go beyond words   i thank genie and tony who play luke and laura for bringing out the fantasy we all have about how love should be   though they are general hospital s greatest achievement  i do not think general hospital s done with them yet   and we know that luke and laura are not the only life changing storyline they have come up with   thank you general hospital  i am not one for soap operas  however  general hospital is different  however dramatic this show gets  i can never get enough of it  it is actually kind of funny how i got started watching it  one time when i was little  my mom was mad at me as i would not calm down or sit still so she made me sit down and read while she watched general hospital  i remember half watching over my book when the show ended  and for some reason  i cared about what happened to jason  so i made a point to watch it the next day and i have never missed an episode since  this is by far the best show on tv and it comes highly recommended  hope this helps  fletcher general hospital is a long running soap opera that had wonderful leadership with gloria monty and wendy riche and amazing writers like claire labine  also great performances by john beradino rachel ames  tony geary genie francis tristan rogers finola hughes kimberly mccullough vanessa marcil alicia leigh willis and billy warlock tristan rogers and finola hughes were incredible as robert and anna in the   and   where gh was filled with action adventure and romance the highlight of the   included storylines of the family  bj jones s death  monica quartermaine fighting breast cancer  stone and robin s love story and their aids storyline  plus the amazing chemistry and connection that made sonny brenda soulmates gh hit a rough patch in     with many backstage changes but it is improving in    one of the most promising current storylines is the aj quartermaine and courtney matthews relationship  billy warlock and alicia leigh willis have phenomenal chemistry that makes watching in   a must  after santa barbara  guiding light  another world  and one life to live  the soap butcher jill farren phelps has placed her friends in high position often ruining such high quality shows  when i was watching guiding light  it was at its peak in    they fired the producer and replaced them with butcher phelps  she drove beverlee mckinsey away by overworking her to death  she killed off beloved ellen parker s character maureen  so parker won an emmy but the loss was much worse for the audience  on another world  she killed off alice barrett mitchell s beloved mary frances frame winthrop in a ridiculous storyline  on one life to live  i could only imagine what she did to that show which took years recover  now she is ruining general hospital by driving the great john ingle away to days of our lives where he received a contract role  i feel sorry and sympathy for jed allan because he has a tough act to follow  the quartermaines used to be the funnest family on television completely  she drove the great dame anna lee away right before her death  now kristina malandro wagner refuses to return unless she gets a contract for playing felicia jones  why are not   am not the veterans of this getting the short end of the stick  i bet gloria monty is livid over the show getting best drama emmy under phelps  i know monty s heart was always in the right place with this show and her last time around was not successful as the luke   laura days but still  i know butcher phelps track record with soaps  nobody in the real workplace would allow somebody whose cost so much damage to so many people  i am glad that robin strasser is speaking against phelps  known favoritism for certain actors  i am going to single them out now on general hospital because it would be unfair  but i know after   years of watching soaps  i could do a better job to satisfy both fans and the cast and crew  i am sorry but phelps is just a soap opera butcher to me  i know guiding light was great at the time but she made terrible decisions which cost fans  now guiding light might be up for cancellation  the cast and crew took a pay cut to keep the show afloat  remember another world  phelps was there before she jumped ship to one life to live  what goes on behind the scenes must be more fascinating than on screen  guiding light and another world were creations of another daytime diva or queen irna phillips who would be turning over in her grave if she knew what this woman has done to her children now phelps is killing off alan quartermaine who has been played faithfully by stuart damon for   years  I am concerned that she is going to lose one of the show s best attributes  the quartermaine family  she and the network practically drove anna lee out over a contract dispute  even with john ingle s welcome return  the shadow over the show is still different  i do not blame cast members like leslie charleson and others for being so vocal about damon s departure  it has   it is as shocking as it comes  this is what you get when you have somebody like phelps at the helm  i have been a viewer since    watched in black and white  was    and still watching  i have seen them come and go on this show and it has   it is still the best one on tv  it has had it has   it is ups and downs and always manages to come out on top  remember jesse  audrey and he sister lucille  that was back in the day  i do so miss the luke and laura thing  luke just is not luke without laura  anthony geary has only improved with age  luke is all that and more  gh also has the best looking guys and the sexiest  is jax gorgeous or what  jason is sooooooooo smooth  and all that too  it will always be hard for the writers to top the original luke and laura storyline it dosen t get any better then that  but they have kept me watching all these years  to every one that is associated with the show  keep up the good work the show has really hit a stride when it had luke and laura saga and how thirty million for a tv audience in the daytime at the time watch their wedding  as it was a big thing  this was also the year where diana and charles married along the way  couples like them  frisco and felicia in the past to dante and lulu in the present  make the soap as the super couples  be why the soap has been popular also the hospital thing known as scrubs as the daily scoop of the inner workings of the hospital  hence the title  in upper ny  like doctors  nurses  cops etc set the star thing for future superstars like demi moore  rick springfield  john stamos among them  a treasure  I am so tired of people saying that general hospital is just a stale old soap opera   gh has been a staple of abc s daytime lineup for   years   it has   it is   in the ratings and i think that am not   are not half bad considering it has   it is age   the alexis  sonny  carly triangle is a masterpiece destined to go down in gh s extremly long history   the actors and actresses who portray the characters on the show are fantastic and so are the writers   i get very upset when people say that it has   it is a stale soap   so when gh tries to do something exciting and fun people say that it is not true soap storytelling  just like the revival of the cassidines  helena  stavros    i thought that that was a great storyline   in closing i would just like to say that general hospital is on the track to taking back the ratings crown from the young and the restless   your the greatest gh     when i was a kid in the    i watched soaps with my mother  it was all the abc ones  all my children  one life to live and general hospital  when i was about   or    luke and laura got married  i wanted to see it so bad  i told my mother i was sick and stayed home from school  over the years i stopped watching the other two and stuck with gh  it has   it is still the best soap I have ever seen  it has   it is not as good as it used to be but it has   it is good  i would love to see less sonny and carly and more luke and  whoever   when luke was the hero  the show as truly great  since now it has   it is all about sonny  it has   it is getting really boring  the same old mobster stuff  sonny is not heroic he has   he is a crook maybe in the future gh will regain it has   it is backbone  maybe draw clear lines between good and evil like it did in it has   it is hey day rayvyn general hospital used to be a great show  back in the late   s and early   s  it was the soap to watch in the early   s  when claire and matthew labine took over head writing duties  general hospital spotlighted so many fantastic  heartwrenching  and honest stories  i mean  what fan of this show will ever forget stone and robin s love story  stone  dying of aids blind due to it   takes his last glimpse of his love  robin by a window and hapilly says  i can see you    then passes away  or will the forget the breast cancer storyline  when monica cuts her bandages off to see that she has no breast  and she just begins to cry uncontrollably  or  the revolutionary and gutsy storyline when young maxie is dyi',\n",
       "  'ng from a heart condition  and is need of a transplant  at the same time   her cousin barbara jean  b j   is rendered brain dead in a school bus accident  tony and bobbie decide to donate her organs  meanwhile felicia  maxie s mom   gets the news that a donor heart has been found  so she goes to bobbie happy that they have found a heart for her daughter  her happiness turns to horror when she finds bobbie crying  instantly  felicia knows    noooo  not barbara jean  not barbara jean s heart  and she collapses to the floor  crying  i cry now as i think about it  and this was ten years ago  and then the scene where tony hovers over maxie  as she recovers from the transplant  and he leans down and places his ear over her chest to hear the beating heart that belonged to his deceased daughter  oh man   this was outstanding television sadly  gh has regressed so much under the watch of bob guza  jr  i do not care what anyone says    it has   it is blasphemy to put a spencer with a cassadine    to me   this show is long gone  with the loss of some of my favorite actors  johnathan jackson  amber tamblyn  kimberly mccullough  sarah brown   and some truly horiffic writing  storylines and pairings    i can never watch this show with the same enthusiasm as i did ten and twenty years ago  for me though   there are few saving graces for this show  the quartermaines   john ingle   whom not only has filled the shoes of david lewis   edward quartermaine  character   but has greatly improved on the original  and this is saying a lot  as david lewis was fantastic as edward   leslie charleson  stuart damon  anna lee  jane eliot  always a good watch when she returns from time to time   and robin christopher  great   maurice benard as  sonny  still delivers the goods  and of course  tony geary as  luke spenser   i just wish the material was better  sadly  unless the labines come back  or someone can be the second coming of gloria monty   I shall   I will just be a viewer on occasion  i do not watch soap opera shows any more because i just do not have the time to watch a show that you have to watch every day but when i did watch soap operas  i watched general hospital which i started watching when i was in high school when a class mate told me about the show and got me interested  i started watching general hospital sometime in the   s shortly after luke and laura got married and i watched it on and off again for several years and though i do not really watch it anymore i still keep up on what is going on by reading about it in the soap opera guide in the newspaper  the only other soap operas i also sometimes liked watching were  one life to live  all my children  and santa barbara but i much preferred general hospital and only watched those other soaps for a short while  once upon a time there was a  story  that brought the kids home from school just to see it  it was called  dark shadows   but then later another soap did the same thing  it was called general hospital  in the early   s this show managed to rise above it has   it is soapiness with sharp writing and novel concepts that attracted the younger viewers female and male  throughout the   s and early   s gh managed to ride on that loyal fan base  but during the last     years gh has struggled mainly due to lousy writing  the current scribes seem to think the audience wants to watch heroic crime lords break the law and beloved characters die horribly  it has   it is a shame that this once cutting edge show has devolved into a show about a mobster  his moll and his cardboard cut out henchman  abc should either fire the current writers and producers or pull the plug on this terminal soap  back in september  i thought gh was finally starting to improve but sadly that was a brief improvement and it is now downhill  soap operas have similar storylines sometimes but general hospital only has the same recycled storylines  the show is predictable and boring  general hospital has a large and wonderful cast including robin christopher  nancy lee grahn  tony geary  rebecca herbst  leslie charleson  billy warlock  stuart damon  chad brannon and so many others  yet general hospital seems to waste this large ensemble cast and only use them to prop up four characters  known as the drab four  sonny carly jason and courtney  by some fans  general hospital has turned into a wanna be sopranos  they hardly ever showcase the hospital or the families  they have backburned older characters or gotten rid of them  like original cast member rachel ames  audrey hardy   the show now puts down the police and strong women like alexis  elizabeth  monica and carly  the writing is god awful and the pairings lack chemistry and are forced  especially the pairing of jason and courtney  alicia leigh willis s courtney showed promise in the beginning but without billy warlock s aj the character and actress is a disaster  nancy lee grahn s alexis was once a strong independent lawyer who is now reduced to dressing like a man to see her daughter  general hospital is now the worst show  it is appalling general hospital needs to write better for it has   it is women  for the police and for all it has   it is characters  they need storylines about family  love  adventure and storylines that are not about the mob  they need couples with actual chemistry that sizzle like steve burton and rebecca herbst s jason and liz  zander and emily or alexis with either luke  ned  or cameron  ted king s return as lorenzo alcazar is a great move but gh does not need more characters  it needs balance  and great writing  i watch general hospital all the time  and i must say  it is the best the ever  it is a soapopera  but  i think even men will enjoy it   i say that because men do watch it  but mostly women  there is just enough action to keep the men interested  and enough passion to keep the women  the show is just a good show  point blank  its plots are amazing  you never know what will happen next  also  the characters are written to a tee  so you fall inlove with them  and end up picking favorites  and picking those you do not like  some people say the show is not good anymore  but i disagree  if you were to of watched back in the day  it had a much different feeling  now  mob families rule port charles  where general hospital is located  but  story lines do not just center around that  if you decide to give gh a try  some characters you should look for are edward  monica  alan  luke  tracy  bobbie  leslie and audry  they are have been on the show for a long time  this show is my opinion  out of a   worst    best  id give it a    it is always keeps me entertained  but  nothing is perfect  even general hospital  i began watching in the fall of   it was the time when the spencer cassadine feud was reignited this  in my opinion  was the show s peak the best characters actors in daytime were front and center sonny corinthos maurice benard jason morgan steve burton luke spencer tony geary lucky spencer jonathon jackson carly roberts sarah brown they made the show worth watching now   years later only   of them remain long past his prime luke has been reduced to a series of boring plots involving the always annoying skye the only reason i still watch is for sonny and jason s scene s but the writers insist on saddling them up with depth less arm candy reese and sam  also the formidable jonathon jackson had great chemistry with his costars tyler christopher amber tamblyn becky herbst genie francis and especially tony geary all subsequent luckys have paled  although i do like jacob young on all my children  i have been watching this show since    i started watching it when carly and sonny were just getting together  so thats who i fell in love with  to this day still love them  and for all of the people who think that they should take sonny of because he has   he is just a gangster and a crook well there wrong  sonny has brought a sexy danger to port charles  he is the one man who you want to kiss and the man who you want to save you  the whole mobster thing is great  he loves his family and he would never hurt them  he does what he has to  to take care of them  to this day there is never a dull moment in port charles  i wish sonny and carly would get together again and that jason and elizabeth would get with each other  i started watching this soap   years ago  i loved watching jonathan jackson as lucky  he is the reason i started watching  now i wish that I had   I would stopped when he left  if someone asked me to pick my favorite storyline I had   I would have to tell them that there has   there is no way i can pick just one sadly i cannot say that I am enjoying what I am seeing on my tv now  this show used to have characters that were worth rooting for and that you loved to hate  now all it has is pathetic wannabe mobsters and characters you just hate  you are forced fed basically   characters sonny  carly  jason and courtney  the writing on the show is horrible and some of  if not all  the acting is horrible  couples with no chemistry are on every single day  jason   courtney  while others who used to be great  sonny   carly  have become boring and props for other couples  i want the general hospital that i used to love  i want the gh was more then just boring mob stuff  the gh that actually had a hospital in it not just sonny s place  the gh that actually cared what fans thought not just what a certain fan base wants  for the first   years or so  general hospital was a basic medical show on daytime tv  nobody watched enter gloria monty  who turned the show into a ratings winner  she created the luke and laura phenomenon  and expanded on that with far fetched stories and international intrigue  eventually  it became stale  as did the luke and laura story enter the    new producers and writers completely changed the image of the show  from romance and intrigue to a show that set out to inform the world about diseases such as aids and breast cancer  something that numerous soaps had done before   although it is good to be socially aware of the world around them  general hospital was not like that before nowadays  general hospital resembles every other soap on the air  there is no way someone can distinguish general hospital from another show  the stories you see on this show are just like the ones you can see on any other show  and that has   that is a shame side note  the show rarely even takes place in the hospital anymore  what has   what is the point of calling it  general hospital  when no story takes place there  and i think there are only   characters who are even connected to the hospital  hello  do not be fooled by the title   while back in the golden ages this soap may have been centered around a hospital but now it has   it is main focus really centers around the mob   i cannot say that i know it was better years ago because gh had been on many years before i was born   the storylines of today are really lacking   golden couple luke and laura are not   am not on the screen and we are forced fed pathetic excuses of chemistry such as the jason and courtney storyline like most soaps general hospital gets caught up trying to make a steamy romance build up for may to try to gain teenage viewers   this means that we usually get some   to   something airhead with a past blow into town and start what the writer s think is a romance with a favored regular   i am a teenager and i can tell you now that i could care less how old some of the cast members are  i want to see real romance   although i may not have been around to see some of the blossomings of past couples that does not mean i do not care the one good actress that gh has is robin christopher who has played skye chandler on three daytime soaps and very well general hospital was once the most graced and respected shows on daytime tv but like most all other soaps bad writing has lost a lot of loyale viewers and failed to gain new ones   if you are already a soap watcher then it may be worth your time to try it but if not then there is not much for you  general hospital struggled for awhile with bad writing but it is improving each and every day  it has once again become a tv show that you cannot miss the pairing of billy warlock s aj and alicia leigh willis s courtney is a breath of fresh air and they shine in an  us against the world    making him a better man  love story the true love story of steve burton s jason morgan and rebecca herbst s elizabeth webber is amazing  it has   it is full of friendship  loyalty  trust passion angst and love  jason and elizabeth are soulmates they are the best since the early days of luke and laura and sonny brenda the return of vanessa marcil as brenda and ted king as alcazar is adding much excitement  all gh needs to do is reunite soulmates sonny and brenda and it will be all set also needed is storylines for brad maule  john j york  stuart damon and leslie charleson  rachel ames  real andrews and a good new romance or the return of emily for zander these characters couples and actors leave you wanting more and put their hearts in to their work  with improved writing general hospital is the best soap opera to watch  i have watched this show for as long as i can remember  i was born in   and watched as a little kid  my parents were fans and i got into it  they both watched all abc soaps   i was also a fan of amc oltl loving port charles  i knew people felt it was weird for a guy to like soaps but i did not care    i was hooked  i remember vcr days and taping every show so i could watch after school and rushing home to catch gh in time lol  i have fond memories of characters staring out on the show that are still on today  luke and laura  frisco and felicia  robert and anna  the q s and all the bickering and backstabbing  robin being there since she was a kid    etc  the show has changed a lot over the years but i would like to think i am as much a an today as i was back in the day  get rid of nell this is ridiculous no one after all this waiting for micheal to get his baby back wants to watch this o k   so i did not start watching  gh  in april of    i was only a month old   but found this as a teen in late spring   just as heather was about to take the l s d   monica announced she was pregnant with a baby  now a j   and laura and scotty were dealing with issues in their young marriage    years later  heather is in a mental institution  occasionally springing back up to make some l s d  caused psychotic rant  the widowed monica is supporting a j  in his bid for elq president  and laura and scotty are arguing over the ma',\n",
       "  'n who initially broke them up  thousands of episodes later with so much having happened in the meantime  i find this enjoyably ironic and cannot wait until monday to see what happens   my joke today is  guess where gh was today  the hospital   yes  the hospital still has not disappeared  but psychotic royal families and mobsters have taken over the majority of the episodes  steve hardy  the late patriarch of the hospital  is occasionally mentioned and honored  and his still beautiful widow audrey may yet pop up again as she did recently for a dedication to him  his granddaughter elizabeth is a nurse there  her brother  and his namesake  steven recently was forced to resign when sent to prison for an out of state crime  and those who were around during his time share his dedication  the show s veteran character  dr  monica quartermain  is now chief of staff  unfortunately rarely seen  except for the occasional family squabble   and is a waste of talent for the still beautiful leslie charleson  her recent reunion with former rival lesley webber  the exquisite denise alexander  shows how much  gh  needs its roots back as opposed to the darkened ones of the many blonde s who dominate the screen as talented an actor as maurice benard is  this show is  gh   not  gm   general mob sital  and after years of mob focused story lines   gh  has divided the show s focus between multi generational characters  the writing is sometimes strong and the use of history amazing  fortunately  vintage  gh  episodes have become available for viewing so young fans can research the show to see why  gh  in the late   s and   s was a true phenomenon  that brings me to the show s leading man  anthony geary s luke spencer  a character i found overrated years ago during the ice princess storyline  yet came to like as his older version of luke was revealed to be truly flawed and not the super hero the old regime under gloria monty made him out to be  i also like the fact that the   version of genie francis s laura is much stronger  still kind but nobody s patsy  even the sardonic tracy quartermain s  jane elliott is a riot  stealing every scene with her presence  and in spite of their bitchy repartee  you can tell that tracy and monica have come to love each other in spite of old wounds often being brought up the younger generation of q s  corinthos  webbers  spencers and cassadines are all taking on the reign of focus  and in spite of the fact that many veterans have been written off  bobbie  alan  or made recurring  felicia  monica   there are always glimpses of the glory days  mentions of brothers rick and jeff webber  original head nurse jessie brewer  lee and gail baldwin and the late edward and lila are nostalgic  seeing pictures of anna lee and john ingle on the quartermain mantle give hope for the show s continuance  the show also supplies some delicious comedy whether it be stuart damon s ghost of alan showing up to play referee between tracy and monica  batty heather going ballistic over a vampire s look alike brother  or the delightful  dominator  alice displaying girl like innocence as supporting young love  the return of long ago veterans like finola hughes  robin mattson  kin shriner  lynn herring and denise alexander reminds us of the glorious  gh  past  which included such wonderful favorites of mine like susan pratt  david lewis  the original edward   frank maxwell  judith chapman  tonja walker  matthew ashford  constance towers  replacing elizabeth taylor as the evil helena  and even short term roles whose memories have not gone away played by melinda cordell  spy  natasha    adrienne barbeau  janis paige  an auntie mame like forger   and michael learned  so sweet to elizabeth as a dying patient i was never a felicia frisco fan  never interested in sonny brenda  and tuned out for a while regularly after lesley webber was  killed off  in    but every so often  if i caught the q s on screen  I had   I would tune in for their witty  cat on a hot tin roof  like conflicts  wanted to jump through my screen to hug aunt ruby  we should all have one    and finally cheered for joy when tracy made her   comeback  so while  gh  has not had my loyalty all the way since    I am like the prodigal son who can occasionally leave for greener pastures  but always ends up home  bradford anderson and jason cook are working on a new project called genreful  had a friend send me this link  looks really interesting  looks like jason cook with be directing and bradford anderson is acting  what a great combo  there has   there is a neat little video on the genreful link with jason cook talking about the project  but if you are a supporter of the projects there are some awesome giveaways and incentive to get involved  it has   it is pretty interesting the way they set it up  plus stephen hanson is involved as a producer in the project  I have heard some great things about him as well and has some cool films in the works  I am looking forward to getting involved in it myself and maybe meet them  http   www kickstarter com projects   genreful ref search so am i deeply concerned about the future of gh s wonderful and exciting plots  I have been watching this soap opera for nearly one month  general hospital had its own recommendation in my case and i had it described in the best possible quality  i was considering me joining the show and start belonging to this world world of gh and its fans  as you can guess i made up my mind to become a part of gh  and i still do not dare to use any bad or negative word for describing it first of all i would like to mention that this soap opera really makes my every day  it is still alive and active in my dreams  it is inside me  it has   it is a living soul in my heart  never before have i been so obsessed about any soap opera  general hospital can boast about its remarkable climate atmosphere  every episode starts with jumping from one scene to another  it has   it is really gorgeous  it is some kind of quick skin  you can take pleasure from enjoying   or   various scenes of sometimes different stories  it makes this soap opera look versatile  it is my impression my constant impression  what is more  general hospital has a very fresh stories  it is linked to the world of drama  sensation   it has   it is also stocked with joke fun here i have this entire story with kate howard and sonny corinthos on my mind  their quarrels fights and  arguments presentations  have this power to make viewers laugh loudly in front of their tv s or computers    furthermore gh shows totally different characters  we watch characters that are absolutely opposite to each other  jerry jacks jax jacks   jerry who was named craig was torturing   people in a hotel treating them with a little bit of cruelty with no honour and goodness  jax is his younger brother capable of sacrificing his own private life for his bad brother  jax is the ideal brother husband son    jason   lucky  jason is this type of man who is supportive for women calm who usually respects others  lucky is a volcano  lucky was abandoned by his own father luke spencer that has   that is why his behaviour makes others feel very bad for him  disappearing of jake let this whole amount of lucky s anger appear and start making trouble in his life  lucky instead of comforting his wife elizabeth  accused her of turning back on jake  it made me furious  there are a lot more opposities but i would like to leave this aspect now last events in gh are remarkable  disappearing of jake sam s secrets that are coming out jax who is searching for his brother luke taking laura etc   I am just after the episode from the   of june and i   i am only about to say that I am dying to watch the next episode cheerz  just awful  i do not recommend  do not waste your time  just one word can describe and the word is awful  pure garbage  this is my first review ever  so please bear with me happy endings was a terribly underrated and under watched show that deserves very high praise  it blows both friends and how i met your mother completely out of the water  and trust me  i love both of those shows too   each character was unique  well developed  and hilarious  the show has a really distinct feeling to it  it was modern in the best kind of way  penny  max  brad  and jane were definitely standout characters for me  alex and dave were great too  but i have to admit they were not quite as interesting as the other four  nevertheless  this show really let us get to know each character both individually and in the group setting  plenty of memorable guest stars helped to round out the cast the writing is smart and funny  there are inside jokes that are recurring throughout the series  i keep finding great jokes upon multiple viewings  it has   it is both laugh out loud funny and make you think a  little funny  this is the one show that i would pick if i could pick any show to come back onto the air  i would even give back season   of arrested development and the veronica mars movie  both of which i love  for more happy endings   if you have not seen this show  watch it right away and fall in love with this amazing group of friends like i did  edit  okay  i may have been a bit over dramatic with that statement    I am actually just writing this to save this show  as it might get canceled soon  i love this show  and it so does deserve another season  as i live in denmark i feel really powerless  because i cannot watch it and help the ratings  i love the characters and the plots of the episodes  this show and new girl are the best new comedy shows and i really want them to continue  the cast is excellent and the writers are amazing and i simply cannot believe the ratings are that bad  so i want to ask all that can have an influence in saving this show  to spend a little time and watch the show so it can survive  it will mean a lot to me and lots of other people  please just watch this show and help it survive  please    this show is simply superb  the deliverance  character development  and plots of each episode are amazing  overall the show is hilariously quick witted  similar to   rock and community  the pilot does not really do the show justice though  all of the characters are quirky in their own way  and they all get into antic situations  I had   I would recommend watching at least the first two episodes to get a feel for what the show is really like  honestly  i cannot wait to see how the show evolves from here  I am sure it will be amazing i recommend happy endings if you like shows like  modern family    rock  and community  do yourself a favour and watch this show  i guarantee you wont be disappointed  I have watched the first two episodes of this show this afternoon to be honest  i gave it a try because it was elisha cuthbert  who i really liked since watching  the girl next door  after the first couple of minutes i knew this might be a great show  the acting is great each of the characters has something different and unique  the dialogs are funny and you get great moments of laugh  i hope this will not change later  overall  i highly recommend this show if you have watched  the   show  or  how i met your mother   i can hardly wait for more episodes  hopefully this will not get canceled after a few episodes like a lot of other great shows were  like firefly or pushing daisies  this is the funniest sitcom since arrested development  it has   it is witty  sharp  and twisted  it gets compared to friends a lot but the characters are jerks to each other in a similar setup as seinfeld or curb your enthusiasm elisha cuthbert who was the weakest link in season one has improved tremendously  she has great comic timing in playing the ditz alex  damon wayons jr  shines as brad  he takes all the great comic attributes of his father and adds his own hilarious spin  i also love how adam pally as max breaks the homosexual stereotype  he thinks just like a straight man and is rude  obnoxious  and hilarious every member of the cast is great and the pop culture references are as penny would say  ahmazing  when you can have a sex dream about the mom on the   s comedy dinosaurs you are a pretty funny show  season one is good but season two and three are where the cast really shines  check the show out if you love community  arrested development  peep show and other witty comedies  i liked friends but i prefer happpy enings  i read an earlier review comparing this show to  friends   they could not be more wrong  sure  its got the typical cast of   main female character and   main male characters  some who are in relationships and some who are single  but this seems to be the norm to most new sitcoms  ie  how i met your mother  big bang theory etc   this show on the other hand is quite refreshing in a way that makes it comparable to other popular past sitcoms  yet is original and different  flashbacks during scenes remind you of scrubs and family guy yet do it in a way that does not make it seem like they are stealing that idea  you have really got to see it to know what i mean so far  while writing this review only four episodes have been shown  and quite honestly  i cannot wait for the next one to come out  the characters all have their own unique qualities that make them interesting and I am sure that as the series goes on we will get to know more about them in my own personal opinion i would definitely recommend happy ending to anyone willing to open themselves up to a new sit com  there have been a lot of friends knockoffs over the past few years  most of them forgettable  some regrettable  but this is one funny show it has   it is well written  fast paced  very funny  the characters are well defined individuals  each with their own quirks without being quirky the first five episodes have all been laugh out loud funny  the situations have been believable and relatable but go to very funny surreal places  it has   it is creative but the creativity all comes organically from the characters so it never seems forced also  no laugh track  no setup punchline timing to make you feel stupid  this show is simply spectacular  I have not had any high expectations when watching comedy pilots this tv year   especially not couples comedies i still thought i should give this a shot because I am a fan of coupe and cuthbert  i can simply say that i loved it the chemistry between the actors are hard to put into words  their acting skills and the writing of the show all combined together make this into such a good show I am so glad that this show has aired   and i can finally watch a new comedy that makes me really l',\n",
       "  'augh hard when watching   yet enjoy the different aspects of the writing and still be humored by the quality of the episodes and their story lines  witty  hilarious  full of fun and replay ability on a seinfeld or friends level  but updated for a new generation  i felt like this was one of those shows that got canceled way too early  i loved it  still do  i wish there were more episodes  i had my doubts about this show at the beginning  i started watching some episode because it aired right after modern family  but after watching a couple of random episodes  i started to get interested the characters really grew on me  i really recognize my friends and i through them  it has   it is funny  touching at times  well written and intelligent  they make lots of references to movies  tv shows  celebrities  so if you do not watch a lot of movies and television  you may have some trouble understanding everything  it has   it is refreshing to see a gay character who has   who is not a drama queen  typical type of gay guy you see on tv  adam pally  who plays the gay character  is awesome and my favorite  it has   it is also so refreshing to see an interracial couple  black and white   that openly make jokes about their differences  the only thing i do not really like about this show  is elisha cuthbert  although i like her and i think she is so pretty  i do not think she plays her character well  i feel like she cannot find her place with the others and she does not really fit  like she has   he is missing something  a lot of times  i just find her awkward  but that has   that is just my opinion  I shall   I will still watch the show  maybe she shall   he will get better with time  so overall  i think it has   it is a super cool show  and please do not compare this series with friends  this has nothing to do with it  it has   it is too easy to say they are friends and do stuff together  and compare characters  it has   it is so much more than that  i never really liked friends and i love this show  they cannot re invent the wheel  we all have friends  a lot of them resemble others  it has   it is based on real life that has   that is it  i really recommend everyone to at least watch season      then you can judge by yourself    i have no faith in any new shows anymore  so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched happy endings  i get concerned when a new show gets slotted in between the hottest most popular shows  but i was hooked right away  there is definitely great chemistry amongst all cast members  the jokes are well written and the timing is well done  one area of concern is what has   what is in store for the couple that fell apart at the altar   i am not sure how they will handle their relationship  but so far so good  they take risks  but they pay off  the result is sweet and funny and engaging  i think it will get even better with time  i am definitely continuing to watch it  i was recently introduced to this show by a friend and was left wondering why I have never watched it before  it has   it is awesome  as a chicagoan  the setting has an authentic feel and while i do recognize the friends esque setting  the characters are refreshing to me my favorites are jane  brad and penny and  frankly  i could happily watch a show about those three alone  i love jane  eliza coupe  and brad s  damon wayans  jr   relationship   they are hilarious individually  but there has   there is something magical about them together  they are amazingly kooky and have their own relationship shorthand  which is endearing  i can relate to penny  casey wilson  on so many levels   she has   he is just trying to get it right and she has   he is so optimistic  even when everything goes wrong max  alex and dave are good  too  but they do not pop for me the way the other three do  i do love that they did not go obvious and flamboyant with max  all six together do have a wonderful rapport great show   i hope it has   it is around a long time  I have just read they have cancelled this which is depressing news it has   it is funny  well acted  great timing  lots of surreal left turns  it has   it is just brilliant and  inspired  comedy  even when it gets ridiculous  they do not break character  which makes it all the funnier  it does not matter that there has   there is no overriding story arc as each episode stands alone  and each is funny  i do not see it at all as like a friends rip off  it has   it is far too leftfield  the only similarity with friends is it has   it is got a group of people who know each other in it yet you have poorly scripted and acted forgettable stuff with awful timing that has   that is basically a sequence of bad slapstick and double entendres  see  two broke girls   and that has   that is renewed  himym which lost its way a while back and has another season to go  what sort of world do i live in     please some other network pick this up  it has   it is ah ma zing    if you are over   you might not like this show  it has   it is the typical fare hollywood is rehashing over and over  but this time it has   it is  modernizing  with an interracial couple  but still the same tired african american man with the blonde white girl   one sided jokes and   sitcom no real story just people hanging out episodes  each pretty much like the last  what makes the shows before it click with an audience is because they are funny  non politically bent with characters that can be individual from the others  happy ending has none of this and feels forced and fake  but the teenagers think it has   it is great  but then again they think mtv is how the real world works  and it has   it is just modern hip enough for pretend hipsters to smugly say  oh yes  it has   it is far beyond the middle and modern family humor  it has   it is cool   there ya go  hopefully  like the other shows before it this sorta rips off  this one too will vanish  i still do not understand   this show is absolutely hysterical and so entertaining  thankfully it has   it is on hulu now so i can still watch when i want  bring it back   even if it has   it is just for one episode reunion   that would be  amahzing   I have had high hopes for this one  i adore elisha cuthbert  and i was so excited that she has   he is returning to tv   but come on    it has   it is    for g d s sake  shows like  modern family    cougar town   and  the middle  are on the air on abc  to name only the single camera comedies that  happy endings  is joining there  not to mention the competition    community    traffic light    both shockingly well written comedies  it has   it is like a rotten apple in an otherwise flawless bowl of fruit i really do not want to be the jerk here  but i honestly do not understand  why this show got     points here on imdb  yeah  the cast is good looking  hollywood  d oh  and they are generally decent actors  hollywood  d oh  pt     but the characters are    well  they almost do not even exist  it has   it is just a bunch of mediocre professionals  fooling around in front of a camera  without any pronounced reason  or goal whatsoever  it has   it is not the kind of stumbling around when taking the very first steps    something s very wrong  that has   that is seated deeper than that I have watched each and every pilot in the past   or   tv seasons  network or cable  everything   and there were many occasions  when i had felt like   ok this was pretty bad  but i can feel it will take off  and get much better   with  happy endings   i have no such feeling at all  there are just too many things that are wrong about this one  the characters that are supposed to be funny  or funnier than the others  are just not  the lines  and plots are not funny enough or at all  the ones that come through after all  are so clichéd  that if i had a penny each time I have heard of seen them  I had   I would be rich i have a very bad feeling about a pilot  when after watching it i cannot remember the characters  names  it has   it is a dead on indicator  that the show is badly written  another  tell  is when I am confused about who is really the lead character  or  hero  if you will  but it has   it is quite silly to talk about heroes since it has   it is  supposedly  a comedy james burrows had said in an interview once  that it has   it is very easy to tell if a comedy is well written   or if it works or not  do not look at the screen  only listen to the dialogue  as if it was a radio play  it has to work  even then  and damn it  it has   it is true  try it  with  friends    cheers    that   s show   i could go on  it works  with  happy endings   it does not  even if you look at the screen it does not but at least elisha is beautiful  that has   that is not enough to save the show  in my opinion  i watched one episode to kill time and feel in love instantly  rarely i actually laugh out loud when I am alone  every time i reply the episodes i still do  each character you will fall in love with and is hilarious  i gave it a well deserved   out of   and will recommend it to everyone i know  the shows characters covers all demographics of the black guy the hot girl the funny football watching  beer drinking gay guy and so on  the style is great on the show with a lot of twisted humor which is awesome  and it has the hot girl from the girl next door and damon waynes son  emediatly after reading this go watch it  and there has   there is a lot of hot girls on the show  i love this show  its fresh  borderline crazy  and its only the first season  if more people hear about this show  it will be undoubtedly a show that everyone will be watching and talking about the next morning  i currently love to watch modern family and this show ranks up there  its a different setting scenario but how it makes me laugh is the same   hard  the characters actors seem so individually talented that the show can probably run live with ad libs  kudos to the writers and actors in this so far  i eagerly await each episode  i really hope that they give this show a chance to get the exposure for people to hop on board  i kinda feel good that i am an early adopter to the show  but i tell everyone that i meet  that its a must see  it has been a long time since i found any sitcom hilarious since friends  thank god for modern family now i have something to watch on  but is it enough no way  and imagine how delighted i was when i watched happy endings pilot  it has   it is unique  funny and you can relate to all the characters  personally  i love all of them but if i have to choose it would be max and penny  max is charming  sassy and a slacker which add more points to him  and penny  she reminds me of phoebe buffay but in less weird world  i think i speak for every guy when i say that we watch this series cause of elisha cuthbert  though ironically her character is flat  gradually changing in second season   of course she is pretty to look at  but have you see her on screen sister  eliza coupe is mamacita sexy  my favorite episode from season   would be  mein coming out  and  the shershow redemption   both brilliantly written and has its own warm that will surely bring smile to every viewers  recommended  same as the other s really  i adore elisha cuthbert  but I am also a big snl fan  so casey wilson was an added bonus  but i dvr d it and gave it a shot and I shall   I will be coming back for more  the episode where adam pally s character is too scared to come out to his parents  so jayne plays his  beard  was great  fast forward to jazz kwon do and i think abc found themselves a winner  listen  its nothing like  friends  other than   males and   females  that crappy show that nbc just axed   perfect couples  was more like it than this  i would certainly say its more like  how i met your mother   meets  cougar town     more shows that have great writing and built some decent back stories for their characters  needless to say  I shall   I will keep watching and hope that abc does not squash it too early  i watched almost a whole episode of this second rate friends  which i also could not stand  show  is this what passes for comedy  inauthentic  unfunny banter between young fairly good looking actors who try to act cool and hip  i cannot believe people like this show  is not the point of a sitcom to make you laugh  i sat through     of tonight s episode and could only shake my head  do yourself a favour and watch a show that is actually funny like parks   recreation  the actors are not hot  they are funny  strange concept for a sitcom  eh  i would rather watch a marathon of that new adam sandler movie where he plays his own twin sister  yes  it has   it is that bad  i love comedy  i hate lame the long review there is nothing less than lame here  how much more unthoughtful well unwritten schlock can you get away with and call it  comedy   it not s exclusive to the usual  i like chewing gum for the mind  set that can get along with a few words and an accompanied laugh track but this really takes the cookie  not for any other reason than the following     why would you want to watch and waste you time with this show     there must be something else on     abc have produced much better shows  why did they think this would be a hit the short review in a nation that put a man on the moon why cannot we learn how to make a funny show without saying that it is funny when it has   it is not  for example family guy   funny  not to be biased but it has   it is not for everyone  the golden girls   funny roseanne   funny   rock from the sun   funny home improvement   funny sitcoms are not   am not funny unless they can be laughed at without a canned laugh track the following above are just examples and not funny for everyone but are widely viewed and repeated  happy endings will probably not be repeated thank god  includes all beliefs but we are one nation  let us laugh at something funny together for once  it has   it is simple as abc  seriously cannot understand why anyone would like this show  it is the worst thing i think i have ever seen  it is not funny in any way and the characters are so annoying  worst set of actors I have seen  they over act each scene and it is basically just insulting to the audience s intelligence  there is absolutely no wit or thought behind the writing  i literally wanted to scratch my eyes out it is that bad  please stop making this show and showing me commercials  even those brief looks into what is coming up on the show is too hard for me to stomach watching  so tired of comedy shows like this that basically come up with the cheesiest jokes and actors they can find  horrible  ',\n",
       "  'do not watch also  please stop comparing this ridiculous show with modern family  not even in the same category at all because this show sucks  i tried to love this show  i could not  it hovers on the edge of two faces  annoying and potential elisha cuthbert is attractive  funny  and compelling  her character is believable and well written     zachary knighton is a good match for elisha but not a compelling lead  i cannot say if it has   it is the actor or the writers  but somethings missing  and from what I have seen from knighton elsewhere he has   he is not the problem  maybe this just is not his role     writers need to make him more cocky with quick one liners   eliza coupe while sometimes her role is funny  it is so often annoying it has   it is painful     adam pally is the only reason to watch this show  he has   he is hilarious  he lands his lines and sells his charm  he owns the role  but he has   he is gay  and that really limits his story line  the whole show already has too much of a gay feel     damon wayan jr  is awesome  just not in here     casey wilson an amazing actress and comedian  just blows  she has   he is so annoying on happy endings that sometimes she literally has me standing up and turning off the tv walking out the back door and shooting myself     endings had such potential  but it ended up being about annoying people  you just do not walk away loving the characters  it has   it is a highly polarizing show  but as a comedy show  it has   it is brilliant  if you want laughs  this is where to go I have read all the reviews here and people have been rating it poorly due to a weak pilot  I shall   I will admit it was weak   cliché characters  they are  and lack of story arc character development this is a comedy  not a light drama  i watch it to laugh  not to see characters develop and romances blossom  this show is similar to how i met your mother s earlier seasons  how it should have been before it became a lame love story  in some ways  it is similar to seinfeld  also no character development  or it has   it is always sunny in philadelphia  also no character development    they are shows to watch and laugh  not for light dramas  cute events and  aww  moments every episode is a throwaway episode in that it can be watched in any order  the story is irrelevant in the big picture and it has   it is just a mechanism for delivering laughs ultimately  it has   it is a comedy  it sets itself out to be a comedy  says it has   it is a comedy and it does a great job at making people laugh  rating it poorly for not having enough drama or character development is missing the point  it has   it is supposed to make you laugh  not cheer you up the jokes are really funny  they are witty  sometimes word based and sometimes situational  there has   there is flashbacks  family guy style   camera tricks  observational  references to other films and more  there is very little slapstick  people tripping  falling and so on it has   it is not for everyone  if you want slapstick  drama and  aww  moments   you have come to the wrong place  if you want laughs  this show does it best  i would say this show deserves more than it has   it is current rating  i see folks bash it but after watching more than   episode   most bad reviews watched the pilot and crucified it   i can say this can have a future  it has   it is well done the acting is good enough the cases are interesting and the whole military guys coming to the be a doctor at a hospital in a night shift is pretty interesting i would say  give the show a chance it can grow on you  i know the market is a bit saturated and over the whole medical drama theme  now if you are completely over medical stuff then there is no convincing anybody i myself am never over good shows and this seems to be a good show  i ve watched till episode   and it has   it is getting better and better  show was pretty decent for season      did some things differently then the standard er show and did them well  season   had some issues but was not all that bad  season   is just a mess  it has   it is hitting all the negative tropes of an er show  the story itself is all over the place and the  big event  for many of the episodes are just ludicrous  sorry to see the series end on such a sour note  i hope this runs longer than one season  i found it charming and uplifting that there could ever be a place where people meant more than the bottom line the characters seemed to fit the heart was in the place with each doctor nurse and staff  maybe it is too much for some just coming back from duty but i liked it  i will be tuning in each week to see what happens  i would class it in line with n c i s and hope it stays around  i wish more shows were of the drama involved here inspired  tragic brings hope without terror keep up the good work the facts are that they do not take entertainment serious anymore  casting works in this case the seem to fit just right  i watched a couple of episodes before i turned it off forever  it is the worst depiction of er life i have ever seen  it is more like a video game than a show  it should be a soap opera not a evening tv show the characters all have unbelievable back stories they are all clichéd they apparently do not have a medical consultant  as the medical care is laughable  they apparently do not have a medical ethicist either  every time they get to the crossroads of a moral dilemma  they take the wrong turn in case nobody told them  you cannot cross match and do heart surgery with er docs in the o r  if an er doc went to the o r  he had   he would be laughed out of the room  oh  writers for this series here s a clue  resuscitated people usually stay on a ventilator for a while and have iv s and stuff  people that sick  look  well  that sick  there is no social worker on the team  i guess that has   that is a blessing as whatever stereotype of us exists would be through the roof  but they do have a full time psychiatrist  on the night shift  it was rare to ever see a psychiatrist in the er let alone have one live there  oh yeah  if we did have one i doubt she had   he would be boinking the narcissistic er doc in the store room i could go on and on but will not  check it out for yourself  being a surgeon myself i watched two episodes  first two   i cannot believe my eyes  i know for cinematic purposes medical procedures are a little different from real world  but when you do open chest surgery in the er  with no masks    what are the directors trying to portray here  drama and coolness abounds but glaring falsity in treating patients must not be twisted  wrong wrong wrong  at least housemd and greys anatomy do not distort the medical procedures  sterility etc   they need a medical adviser to make this better  the first episode with the doctor doing auto transfusion without filtering is again a misnomer with what we really do  i will not go to this hospital ever  this show is terrible  but on a level where its almost playing on all the cliches that make network tv so bad  which is why i love this show  it feels intentional by the producers  eerily similar to    party of    and dawson s creek of   years ago  random slow motion scenes  ridiculous explanations for what caused the patients trauma  way over dramatized er power struggles out of no where  wierd sexual tension  the stereotypes are perfect and extremely unrealistic  problems are solved out of no where throught an episode  and relationship paralyzing issues over the most random things  the acting is so on point  just like one of christopher guest s infamous mockumentaries if you despise network programming between the hours of     pm monday friday  there is a good chance you will love this show  for those who miss the daytime soap operas  this should be your cup of tea  everyone at this hospital bickers with each other  patients never die  well  they do die  but the staff performs miracles and brings them back to life  and doctors and nurses are constantly hopping into bed with each other  and if you tire of the hospital surroundings  you can enjoy the same ridiculous plots that take place in syria  the stories are all embarrassing and beyond belief and the acting is worse  case in point is scott wolf  i am not too familiar with him  but i know he has   he is been around for decades  if all his work is similar to the character he portrays here  it is a mystery to me how he continues to get acting jobs  his grimaces  bug eyes  and gestures are laughable  he treats every line like he is reciting shakespeare  when he has   he is on camera i just cringe  the only mystery bigger than how he gets acting jobs is why so many people think this is a good show  i do not normally write actual reviews on here but i thought this was necessary after seeing some of the bad reviews  this show is great  from the action  to the characters and the relationships between characters it has   it is a show that i find really enjoyable  if you love dramas with action and a bit of comedy to keep things interesting then you will absolutely love the night shift    ignore the negative reviews on here the night shift is awesome and really enjoyable  a definite     i hope it runs for a lot longer cannot wait to see what happens next i have to start off by saying that i am not usually a fan of medical drama shows  i was never interested in er  grey s anatomy  scrubs  or any of the other shows of this kind  this one  however  i like i first watched the show because it stars eoin macken  i loved his light hearted  somewhat goofy portrayal of sir gawain in the bbc show  merlin   so i thought I had   I would see what he could do with this role  I am very impressed with his work on this show  which seems to improve with every episode  his breakdown scene after his friend topher is shot triggering overpowering flashbacks to his time at war  is heart breaking  the fact that he may be the most perfectly gorgeous man who ever lived is just a bonus the show centres around a group of army doctors who now work on the night shift at a hospital in san antonio  macken plays t c  callahan  a doctor who is suffering from ptsd  though it is never specifically stated  the cast is lively and interesting  it includes callahan s ex  girlfriend  jordan  as the acting chief of staff for the night shift  and a secretly gay army doctor who does mma fighting on the side  there are also two interns  one who is capable  cool  fun  and fits right in  and the other who is  book smart  but naive  there is a hospital administrator who seems like a real stick in the mud  a psychiatrist who is having a sexual fling with t c   and jordan s current boyfriend who joins the hospital as a trauma surgeon with all of these colourful characters  there are endless story lines  there are always sub plots alongside the main action  and everything blends together seamlessly  i have to admit that i found the first episode clumsy  as there was limited time to introduce so many characters  but after that  the show really took off the action in each episode is non stop  being army doctors  these guys often fly out to do triage at a chemical explosion  or airlift a shooting victim from a remote hunting accident  do i think this is a realistic portrayal of an average doctor s shift at work  no  is it dramatic  exciting  fast paced  and fun  hell  yeah although the plot changes each episode  it always furthers the personal story line of the characters  each of them faces insecurity  doubt  jealousy  fear  joy  victory  and loneliness  there is a strong emphasis on camaraderie  sticking together through thick and thin  and helping each other  there is the occasional make out session in a storage closet  pranks played on their new intern  and even a male nurse helping the boss write a dating site profile  all of which lighten the mood from time to time sometimes the patients die on this show  sometimes the doctors make mistakes or have a melt down  it just adds to the drama  as outcomes are unpredictable  this is the kind of show that you allow yourself to enter  rather than sit back and observe  while it has   it is not demanding to watch  it is intense most of the time  I have shed a tear in many episodes  i find it quite funny how the general public of today cannot give credit where it has   it is due  this show  any show at that is geared for entertainment purposes and that has   that is that i find  the night shift  entertaining  well acted  thought provoking and greatly paced  just because what unfolds during  the night shift  may not follow protocol of an actual e r  that does not mean it should take away from the show it has   it is a show for entertainment purposes  if you do not find this entertaining go stare at a rock  you also have to realize  this show brought plenty of people work for an extended amount of time  i happen to be personal friends with one of the main  lead actors  i spent quite a bit of time on set and the effort put forth for this show to become a success was immense  everyone worked their tails off  everyone took pride and the local economy workers prospered greatly  if a show  as this one can boost a local economy  like abq  where filmed  then fantastic  also  for all the under qualified naysayers of this show  tune in next season for season   of  the night shift   enjoy tonight s episode  this show has very strange politics the emergency room is having a hard time staying open because of  cut backs and obamacare  is this fictional texas hospital but the poor infant cannot have dialysis because of no insurance   had texas increased medicaid coverage as offered by obamacare the child would be covered   the hospital janitor s daughter cannot get a scan of the lump on her abdomen because of no insurance   but if she has   he is under   years old  she has   he is covered under her father s policy under obamacare   the hot doctor s medical education was paid    by the u s  government because he was in the army at the time  I am confused  is the message  the government should have universal health insurance coverage and pay for the education of our doctors   even in the state of texas that said    the characters are no strangers to medical dramas  there is the tough administrator who may have a heart of gold  the second in command who is smart  very good looking and compassionate  the macho closeted gay doctor  the nurse who    well  you get the idea  it has   it is been done before in countless number of medical show that barely made it to   episodes  still  if you like that sort of show  and i do   it has   it is worth a watc',\n",
       "  'h  i look forward to viewing the summer shows but night shift is the best new show i have seen in years  i hope the nbc has the good sense to bring it back for a full season    the characters are rich and well developed  the plot lines are excellent and the writing is superb  having worked the night shift in a hospital years ago i can appreciate the various trials the staff has to endure such as shortage of staff  equipment  etc  but even to the layman this show has everything to offer with the story lines  suspense  a little romance  the hesitation of new doctors trying to care for their patient s with as much expertise as their limited experience allows and glimpses into the past of some of the doctors that contribute to the people they are currently  this new series hit the ground running with adrenaline charged action emergency room trauma from   seconds into it at a level equivalent to a blockbuster action movie   i will not reference the army field procedure in the forest in the first few minutes but it will knock your socks off   the night shift kept the heart pounding adrenaline up throughout the entire first season  i am enthralled and in love with this series  great writing  great dialog sarcasm character development  camera story  this is a smart show  any poor reviewers of this show are clearly under  educated  i feel sorry for those folks who left a negative review and obviously hate everything and the people bother to read their negativity  nbc take note  this show is devoured appreciatively   thank you    please renew seasons      i have not been sparked to watch a medical drama  one of my favorite genres since i am a doctor  since er  the night shift blows grey s anatomy out of the water   grey s anatomy is a soap opera with a little medicine thrown in for garnish  the night shift  thankfully  is centered around original creative trauma scenes with serious medical maiming that the cast has to handle on their own via diagnosis  treatment and surgery  in the same way real overnight er doctors would in one hospital that serves a lot of military staff  excellent acting  brilliant story lines  keep it coming    thank you   i usually give new series a three episode window  i stopped recording after two  it has   it is just bad  forget the fact that they have doctors performing heart transplants without doing tissue matching tests  doing field surgery  and hitting each other  the stereotypes of veterans  blacks  latinos  nurses  doctors are abundant and insulting  the characters are tropes as are the situations  the troubled veteran  fighting for justice while recovering from ptsd  give me a break  it has   it is insulting to doctors  veterans  and people with ptsd the writing is manipulative  the druggie who threw himself off the roof miraculously recovers so that the decorated vet cannot have his heart and then dies  oh  the irony  i can only imagine the damage this second episode did to organ donation programs after the parents were virtually strong armed into donating their son s heart  do not waste your time on this one  i watched the first episode and thought this can only get better  give it another chance  episode    how wrong can one be  it actually got worse and i finally turned it off after   minutes  a definite no go  the acting is only as bad as the script makes it  there are a couple of good actors in this show who should be doing better work  wonder sometimes whether they really read the script or they get talked into things  i can really claim i have been watching tv for around   years and have seen good things be canceled and bad things stay for a long run  maybe they will manage to make this better but they will have lost so many viewers by then it may be too late  I am gone  you just know this show is not going to be realistic in any form right from the first minutes of the pilot episode   small spoiler  who seriously gets released from jail  hops on their motorbike  performs a lifesaving operation along the way  successfully  and then gets into work and swaps their bloody shirt for a scrubs top  seriously where was the shower     spoiler over i decided to instead judge this show on how it obviously wanted to be portrayed  a dramatic action comedy that just happens to centre around a bunch of doctors working the night shift  after coming to terms with this fact and actually watching more than one episode  i have come to the conclusion that this show is not too bad  it has some interesting cases and while the cast are ridiculous they are what draws you into the show  they feel like normal people who just go through extraordinary things if you are watching this because you like medical shows like grey s anatomy   er then give it a miss  but if you just love watching over the top action dramas then you may really enjoy this show  this show is supposed to be set in san antonio  but looks nothing like it  san antonio has no mountains and is not in a desert  looks more like a rural backwater than a large city  i doubt the writers have been to san antonio or texas the plot has a patient who needs a neurosurgeon  but the only one is finishing a surgery in houston  which the writers obviously do not realize is   miles away   san antonio has no neurosurgeon  really  a city of     million people  i could overlook the sizable factual flaws if the characters were not so one one dimensional  bland and predictable  the plot does nothing to grab your interest  no humor  no suspense  just boring texas is such an interesting place  diverse cultures  a nice variety of natural disasters  hospitals that deal with urban problems and transfers from far flung rural areas and  perrycare  all could have provided interesting story lines  but no  the writers stick to the already overdone stereotypes  what a waste  seriously  this show is terrible  looks like a bad takeoff of grays anatomy and er combined  a macdreamy look alike  a meredith character  a naive intern straight out of er  the wise counsel of the calm dry  green   seriously  do television execs think we the audience are that gullible  had trouble following the dialog  the pacing was chaotic at times of high drama  the storyline was too far fetched to be believable   a child with multiple and violent personalities acting stiff and forced  bedside scene with dying hero so contrived  i am sure the actors in this show can do much better   writers and director to blame  i am done  shutting it off  never to return  yes  this show is both unbelievable and stupid  it is as though its writers randomly took a handful of clichés out of the hollywood not so big bag of clichés and threw them together in hopes that somehow they would create a watchable show  well  they do not it is just another unbearably pompous and self important    and because  or is it despite   of that completely unconvincing    network tv disaster  of which there are plenty  where the characters look and sound as if they stepped right off the modeling runway  with acting skills to match their original occupation  it does not escape anyone s attention    because how could it     that in addition to stunning good looks  the average age of this  er  staff is    ok  maybe   and a half  they must all be graduates of the doogie howser medical on line program            for a diploma   and they act it  too a bunch of high school students putting on a play for parents would probably do a better job than this cast  although  to be fair  the dismally hackneyed writing is mostly to blame  if you want to waste your time on another predictable so called medical drama where the glamorous doctors  main preoccupation is who has   who is shtupping whom  then this new ish  nbc fiasco is for you  otherwise do not bother p s  not so confidential to the show s writers  after the       episode   immaculate conception does not mean what you think it means   and that has   that is one of the less jarring missteps  eh   awesome series  its heart throbbing  action and comedy all in one  certainly a great series  its the ultimate best  it shows emphasis on real people and how their work life s contribute to their professional life in the med field  it shows you also how passionate people are about saving lives and the behind the scenes of how real doctors and nurses lives are  the casting crew is amazing    its like they characters are like family members they love and care for irrespective of caste or creed  the comedy is good and the fact that their saving life makes your heart skips a beat with the intense scenes  i seriously enjoyed it and recommend to all  its addictive  hope there has   there is more seasons to come of this amazing series    i honestly could not believe how bad this was  it looks cheaply made  the acting was like watching acting students who knew they were being filmed  now i know some of these actors have been successful in other things  so i have to blame the writers and the show itself  it feels like a jumble of   other medical  dramas  with the all the parts that do not work  i watch stuff like this to fall asleep to but i found myself waking up with annoyance at how bad it was  this is the medical version of  friends with better lives   which i felt the same way about after one episode  i said that is getting canceled stat  and it was  this will never make it  they will burn it off for summer and it will be done  there is nothing worth watching on this show  this show had all the pieces to be something great  but it is sadly more of a let down then anything else  you easily fall in love with some of the characters like brendan fehr and his portrayal of dr  alister  ken leung as dr topher  jr lemon as nurse kenny and freddy rodriguez playing michael rogosa as the hard arse that you grow to love  however through out a show that is meant to capture humanity in some of it has   it is most vulnerable times and deal with current issues across a wide spectrum  the writing is weak and unfulfilling  you have main cast member shave tumours in one episode and then they have survived what few do without any screen time of this  you have a character that is struggling to be openly gay and where this is an occurring theme  after his partner loses his leg and a small break up they run off to get married  which again we do not see  another main characters is written off by an email being sent to the staff to say he died in a car accident  after being on the show for   season and guess what the next episode is a month later  where the whole team have healed from this tragic passing  the afore mentioned gay couple try to adopt a kid when the real dad turns up out of the blue with about   mins screen  of course wanting to stop them and by the end of one episode this is all resolved and they take there daughter home  it just feels like lazy writing and no interest in actually exploring things in depth  which is a shame because they had some good examples of storylines  such a disappointment all and all  where there is short lived problems and miraculous diagnosis  a rather weak start with the morals of the characters  they seem to believe that what they feel is best is what they should do regardless of the patient s wishes  some things include cutting off medical bracelets and disregarding dnr or sedating another person in order to obtain their blood for donation another user said it best when they described this as similar to grey s anatomy as there is a mcdreamy   meredith  other things that can be considered annoying is the two female brunettes jordan   krista  since they are on the same team they wear the same colour clothes  similar long brown hair so it can be difficult to determine which is which until you get used to the two of them  it would have been better to put in a blonde or a redhead instead  having being deployed twice as a hospital corpsman with the marines and working in the e r and icu  i can tell you this show is bunk  no er doctor is going perform surgery  they may place chest tubes  perform thoracentesis and cricothyrotomies medical doctors in an active combat roll  no  not going to happen  they are not   am not going out of the wire let alone drive a humvee or engage in combat doctor s as part of a medvac team  again not going to happen  did the writers and producers of the show just pull what the thought how an e r operated out of their ass  i know it has   it is  entertainment  but do not insult people s intelligence  I am not surprised by the news of  the night shift  being canceled  i have been a loyal fan of  the night shift   but in the fourth season  the series really lost touch with its roots  the fourth season started out just okay  but by their fourth episode  it started going downhill  the show seemed it faced a bit of an identity crisis  as it could not decide whether or not it was military medicine or work back at home at texas san antonio night shift  i think the series peaked in its third season  season three was near perfect  but the show s fourth season had too much going on  as i said  come the fourth episode and that point on    the night shift  always had the issue of balancing military based stories and work at s a m   but it became much more obvious in the show s fourth season  i think part of it might have been sending t c  back to syria  while also introducing the new nurse  played by mark consuelos   while also following t c  s new love interest of the year  cue the eye roll   it got to be too much  if the series stayed in touch with it roots through season four and then got cancelled  I had   I would be upset  however  that just was not the case  i will not miss  the night shift   not to mention most of us will not  as the ratings do not lie the show s first season was just average  the second season was an improvement  the third was great  and then it fell apart  i am sorry to say the showrunners and writers brought this on themselves  going all over the place and ruining the core focus doomed a once good show  had they continued along the paths of seasons two and three  they just might have made it to their fifth season after season one  i gave  the night shift  a        after season two  i gave it a        after the third season  i gave it an        if it was not for season four  i would probably give this show a solid      but it happened and i really dreaded the show s fourth season  i am now only convinced that all that goodness was for nothing  i give it a        i am really sorry to say this but it would have been best if the series ended in its third season  it would have ended on a major cliffhanger but on a really high note

       " ['sorry  I have gotta go with the negative nerds on this one  i love star trek  I am an old man  and i watched tos episodes as a kid  i shushed my kids during new tng episodes because i could not wait for the video tape to watch it  i watched    voyager  the films  the cartoons  i even broke down and watched  enterprise   just to get the monkey off my back    way to kill the franchise  bakula    and discovery  never mind I have put up with a lot over the years  walking around with  robot commando  spock  searching the universe for his missing brain  whiney captain janeway and her heroic poses  watching a hot vulcan go topless for ratings  or tom hardy in a lovely evening gown  goofy looking klingons in elizabethan armor  and so on  but i love star trek  so i put up with it now someone has turned it ugly  in episode    i am expected to watch a man get his eyeball drilled out of his head and listen to him screaming all the way through it  i do not want to see that on any show  but on star trek it makes me feel betrayed  i want to watch st with my grandsons  i do not want torture and sadism featured on my favorite show  I am willing to suspend my disbelief  put up with bad writing and gaping plot holes  listen to rabid and thinly disguised moral or political agendum  even see some of my heroes fall  but suddenly the whole st universe is dark  and the future is no longer hopeful  is the world really that way  sure  but that was the appeal of this alternate universe  its overall message was   things will eventually be    okay  if you guys want to make an edgy  dark sci fi drama  fine  but make your own show  do not ruin star trek to do it  i am at the moment watching fifth episode  i was forcing myself to watch all these episodes expecting it might get better  but honestly i am disappointed and angry because it is boring  not star trek  and dragging as if they plan to have   thousands episodes      after   episodes i just cannot take it any longer  what a mess  this is not star trek  i do not know what this is but it is not star trek update march    after forcing myself to watch further episodes I have now reduced my rating from   stars down to   and i really wish i could give it a zero  i thought discovery was bad but this rubbish makes discovery shine  up to episode     all that has gone could have been done in one episode  ridiculous fight scenes involving patrick stewart who is too old to be part of them scenes and a ridiculously french accent in ep    just dull and a stretched series  i struggled through the first   episodes hoping it was going to get better it never really did  but the final straw came at the start of episode    i mean the unneeded over the top gore and violence i thought was well completely off putting  so much so i stopped watching the movie  why on earth they need to put violent gory scenes like that in star trek as well as the multiple f bombs make no sense to me  the plot is slow and boring  the characters are dull and you do not really care about them  you just wish they were like they were in tng  but they are no where near as likeable  and the unneeded gory violence and swearing is completely off putting  so just like discovery picard is getting thrown into the trash for me  cbs has totally destroyed this franchise and the orville is the only current place to watch a real star trek like show  there some real funny business going on here with this list show s rating being      at the time of this writing   not only is it so obvious that this show is terrible  a look at the reviews shows mostly   s    s  and   s  how does it average an     fake news the only thing this has in common with stng is character names  it has   it is just another action show that has ditched everything that was good about it has   it is predecessor  while some are falling over themselves slobbering this show with praise  i  a fan since    will not  trek started to go downhill with the rushed into production  voyager  continued the tailspin with the tepid enterprise  hit a terrible bumpy road with the mostly unwatchable kelvin films  and is now being destroyed by this fool kurtzman  discovery  with it has   it is dark  crappy storyline as well as a non existent sister for spock  one of the dumbest ideas in the history of star trek  and another unnecessary prequel  we have the boring picard  cbs is in this just for the money  while kurtzman seems to think his foolish ideas and ignoring of star trek history make his stuff great  wrong  the lens flare  the cursing  making the romulans this honorable people   stolen from the klingons   making the federation a bitter alliance who turn their back on the romulans  picard is the only one left with a conscience  ridiculous  as for bringing back picard  why is cbs so afraid to do something truly new  an entire new cast  go into the future rather than making prequels  reboots and retreads  bring in a guy like manny coto  who saved the   season of enterprise and fire kurtzman  he has   he is the zack snyder of star trek  bring back a direction for the franchise and point it into the future where it belongs  what is it trying to do  why imitate star trek mandolorian when the franchise had so much good to borrow from  obnoxious music and unnecessary backstory when did capitan picard fell on his head  no cohesion in story and worst direction  more like a haphazardly edited movie trailer then a series  the first episode had me interested for a bit then it just went into the toilet and every episode since has left me completely disappointed and more and more disinterested  there are a few special effects scenes that look amazing but that has   that is it  and that has   that is not nearly enough to make me watch any further  the writers and producers of this farce need to be canned  while it was pretty clear the episodic star trek tales are unlikely to come back   and they did not need to  given picard s age   this series is an utter disppointment and wasted opportunity I am through half of season   and not much has happened yet  there is no story arch worth mentioning and characters appear flat  and if you have ever watched st tng  everyone is out of character anyway  it has   it is probably the worst written series since nightflyers  where nothing makes any sense if you spend a few seconds thinking about it if you enjoy science fiction  watch  the expanse  and compare the first five episodes to st p   the writers there managed to establish a whole new universe  background story  characters we care about and most important a stroy arch we are excited to follow st p is neither star trek nor scifi  it has   it is some uninteresting drama series in some fantasy setting  not worth watching  i grew up watching star trek and have become an engineer because of its inspiration  however  this show does not inspire me  there has   there is violence  strong language  and a confusing story line on the other hand  they are ruining beloved characters such as seven of nine as it seems she is a murderer now  far from the character we remember from voyager  having been a star trek fan for decades  was so hopeful for a new star trek series  picard has as much to do with  star trek  as a frozen tv dinner has to do with a gourmet meal  the characters are flat  and lack the chemistry with each other that was always evident in all the other star treks  suffered through the first   episodes   had to pull the plug  sir stewart please retire  ms  ryan you deserve better than this silly wanna be sci fi   this show resembles one of the more boring next gen movies except even slower  darker  and less like star trek than ever before  if you enjoy very slow  very poorly written incoherent messes like the rest of anything kurtzman has ever been involved with  you probably still will not like this show  do not waste your time  when gene roddenberry created st  it was with a sense of optimism and a profound belief in the power of people  whatever their planet of origin  this was encapsulated by the concepts of the federation and the desire of people to expand our knowledge and understanding of ourselves and the universe around us  the original series reflected and recognised the social problems of the time and looked forward to when we were bigger than these issues by being better st  picard is set in a slow  depressing and down beat galaxy  how did that happen      the main protagonists  including picard  are self absorbed  self serving and self centred  gone is the ambition to make the world s  a better place  they are operating in a cess pool of greed and corruption and appear to be very comfortable in that environment i started watching st tos in the     having enjoyed all the various iterations to varying degrees  yes  discovery too   this however  is not star trek and after trying to find some redeeming feature in any of the   episodes aired so far  I am giving up on it  I am sorry for the harsh title but i mean it  this is not a star trek show or even a good show the   episode makes it clear the writers never watched star trek  ever  first off  there has   there is no currency in star trek  the writers forgot that and decided to reintroduce money into this  the peoples rid themselves of currency  thus creating a utopia  in the real star treks in picard  poverty  mercenaries  rich people  financial classes and woes are back like they never left    this has ultra violent crap and ridiculously unnessecary swearing abound  this show caters to a sadistic and moronic audience who desires to see dystopian futures e i  not trekkies all the good star trek shows  from the original series to star trek  enterprise heavily valued living beings and hope  enemies of the federation would still be shown as people  living  thinking  breathing people  st  picard treats people like disposable garbage who will suffer gory fates with no end in sight  it is bleak and dreary  the opposite of what star trek is about  i love star trek but this show is too boring and lagging what star trek usually offers  where is the star trek action and adventure that we come to love  i surely dont see it this is too boring  star trek was philosophy  humanism and moral dilemmas presented in a gracious profound way  it was theater  it was inspiring  it was sublime star trek tng was last bastion of culture in a tv series and this    this is what writers can produce now this is their best this is what corporate art did with the most cherished franchises this is woke culture not understanding how you present moral and political issues to the masses with grace and with emotional appeal at the same time  this shows that people financing this has a total disconnection with art  society  and the viewers this is a mockery of star trek fan productions in yt have more substance nobody will remember episodes of discovery or picard in   years  before i watched this i asked a friend his thoughts on this episode  i quote   its like if you asked me what do i think after seeing the face of cthulhu  what would i say  horror and madness  many times i thought  this is ill intended   someone said  there is too much philosophy in star trek  lets change that and make a sitcom  these billionaires aproving this circus are living in the clouds  they just throw money  what else do they have  for the first time star trek and star wars are  united in pain   i posted this on the   episode  but it should be here please seth mcfarlane  buy star trek we beg you make roddenberry proud  please  someone should tell the writer to watch tng  i am so sorry that sir patrick stewart  who is acting flawless btw  got involved in this  do not watch this show  is pure garbage  just change the name of the show and nobody will know it has   it is star trek  but a huge disappointment  this show has nothing to do with the star trek  script  acting  politics  federation etc  all ruined this show  what a wasted opportunity to do a high quality scifi show  i get the idea  our world is falling apart and so we need a trek show that is not as bluntly idealistic but one that is a bit colder  a bit crueler and in which picard acts as like a bernie sanders in space who remembers the values of old that has   that is fine but the show does not deliver what similar shows like the expanse  galactica or firefly gave us the characters are flawed and broken  which is fine  but they are also bland  depressing  lifeless  joyless and just very very dark and brooding this show has no moments of light to balance out its dark and grittiness the show also has a big mystery in the spirit',\n",
       "  ' of lost and i am not really hopeful the mystery will be solved in a compelling way this show is best avoided  managed   episodes  waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen  started the   and just could not keep watching  boring  boring  boring  honestly  do not bother  i wanted to like this  i tried for   episodes now  it is just not developing properly  and it feels like cbs went really cheap on us writing  dialogue and character development are all shallow and superficial  production quality looks cheap the departure from star trek in general is just huge without a strong justification they make jean luc come across as even older than he is  in fact they diminished him so much that it is almost insulting and they keep creating opportunities to remind us that he is too old for this  this i find weird  detrimental to the show and completely unnecessary   episodes of what amounts to a setup and the season has    they surely took their time  we are pretty much half way through and very little has developed the ship  and the crew are just awful  deprived of almost all of the star trek feel  the expanse s rocinante is a better  more exiting ship with a soul  character and a heck of a story to tell  if you want a real ragtag crew ship  that has   that is where you shall   you will find it  not in this sorry attempt to tell a different star trek story the character dynamics in picard suffer from something I have seen in too many shows that did not last long  extreme individualism  lack of compassion  selfishness  cynicism and mistrust  they are all in as a part of some deal  but what we really crave in drama is love  compassion  sacrifice and selflessness  discovery injected these virtues into star trek correctly and artfully  picard so far failed completely at this and created an emotional void that only amplifies other problems the federation resembles the roman empire just before the collapse  they are infiltrated and run by all kinds of agenda with no real structure  mechanism    and the will really    to self correct  suddenly  in the   century after centuries of progress i am to believe that humans reverted to circa    vaping  swearing  bickering and engaging in egoistic back and forth and before you give me the kurtzman explanation for swearing  that has   that is a prepared bs response to criticism which they expected  while it may be true that sweating was not a legal option in the early days of broadcast tv  star trek fans did come to understand it as a feature of the imagined better humanity  as symbolic as it is  they should have known this  discovery used it sparingly and smartly  they knew the risks and they packaged it masterfully  this now is in your face     because i can   probably even hoping to create controversy and social media discussion the sense of awe and wonder is gone  boundaries are not being pushed  human spirit is not being tested and challenged  melancholy has set in and everyone seems riveted by grudges and ego at times it feels like jean luc is in a different sci fi  an alien himself  struggling to fit into the writing of whatever this is  diminished to an almost miserable old man  so much going on with nothing really happening  only being dragged out to keep viewership  no originality some good characters and directing  but the writing really  really let us this down  when i first reviewed episode   i gave it      it was slow paced and nice world building  also  i guess i was happy to see picard again since then though this show has gone down hill so fast it is unbelievable  the next   episode are really boring and nothing of consequence happened  and in retrospect you should be grateful for that  because once stuff does happen it is the worst you shall   you will ever see episode   was so dreadful that even hardcore nutrek fans were not able to defend it anymore  this series has nothing to do with star trek anymore  neither visually  nor the characters  nor the story and most certainly not the writing this show is  star trek  in name only  star trek is dead and alex kurtzman will not stop dragging its corpse around in hopes of making a quick buck  there are   series planned for the near future and all of them will be a dark gloomy dystopia so much removed from star trek they might as well have made a random scifi show and just slapped the name on it   which is what they did basically anyway  law   order  special victims unit is one of the best and most underrated shows on tv  it stars christopher meloni as elliot stabler  a tough as nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show  he has another side  a vicious side  that criminal intent s robert goren  vincent d onofrio  lacks  I am very pleased that he has   he is been nominated for an emmy  mariska hargitay won an emmy for her performance as olivia benson  another fantastic detective  benson has more edge than ci s alex eames  kathrine erbe   but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects  her life is put in danger at least twice a season  yet she continues to be strong  next is the sarcastic detective jon munch  played by the excellent comedian richard belzer  munch may seem annoying at times  but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent  and he plays the  good cop  bad cop  role very well  the final detective is finn tutuola  played by former rapper ice t  ice t plays the character reasonably well  but i think we had   we would all like to see a meaner side of him  he was very good in the episodes entitled  rage   and  rooftop   they are led by don cragen  played by dann florek  and cragen is as good a captain as any  as florek reprises his role he held on  law   order  for a few years  adam beach recently joined the show  bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost  surfer dude  approach to detective work  the ada now is casey novak  played by diane neal  who could be better  but she gets the job done  she has   he is been better of late  and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show  her predecessor  alexandra cabot  stephanie march  was great also  the team is also aided by an fbi psychiatrist  george huang  bd wong   who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person  witness or suspect  his best performance was in the episode called  coerced   the members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes  rape  rape homicide  and child based crimes  school shootings  child abuse  child molestation   the show has had extraordinary guest stars  from evil  johnny messner  reg flowers  asio highsmith  jeff kober  to touching  leland orser  jerry lewis  to lost  brittany snow  to famous and legendary actors  jerry lewis  dean cain  chris  ludacris  bridges  henry winkler  robin williams  matthew modine  alfred molina  cynthia nixon  john ritter   this is a truly great show that not only shows the line of work in this graphic department  but shows the emotional stress a detective goes through      i have never one been that big of a fan of the original law   order  i would watch it for time to time and it was an alright show but never really had anything jump out at me to make it one of my cannot miss shows  then this show came on  i watched this show when it premiered back in   and was impressed from the get go  sure it followed the basic premise of it has   it is original cousin but was much more loose on it has   it is format and execution  some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern  first half hour is the law then the next is the order  this show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it  mariska hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of det  olivia benson  the whole cast as a whole is magnificent  now i know a lot of people will disagree with me that this show is in no way better than the original but for me it is  it has given me something that the original never did  this used to be my favorite of the l o franchise  until stabler left  the last several seasons have done nothing but shamelessly pander to a political agenda  rather than focus on engaging plots  as they once did  it has   it is regrettable that this show has become such a disappointment  it feels like I am watching a sinking ship  when i am communicating with other people interested in crime series it is remarkable how many people seem to watch either csi or csi  miami or both  rarely  actually never  have i heard talk about this show  unless i brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them  of course i do not know the situation in america and other countries regarding this show  but i feel it is very underrated in the netherlands  of course this has a lot to do with it has   it is programming spot  while csi is usually on saturday s at     or     p m  and csi  miami on tuesdays at     p m   svu s spot has been sunday s around   m  for quite some time now  that has   that is hardly what i call a prime time spot  just to compare i looked up the share s of those   shows on the internet  csi has a share of   in the us and     in the netherlands  for csi miami these numbers are     and     and for svu they are     and      this does not mean much  but once bring the number of households into it  it gets a lot clearer  csi has about     million viewers in the us while csi miami and svu have     and     viewers respectively  in the netherlands these figures are     million    thousand and   thousand  this means that svu has less than one third of the viewers csi has and much less than half the viewers csi  miami has  in america svu has two thirds of the viewers of csi and about    more than csi miami  in my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot svu has gained in the netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two csi s  for i feel it cannot have anything to do with it has   it is quality the thing that makes svu stand out so much in opinion  is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt  i personally appreciate it very much  that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music  mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short  maybe that has   that is just another  trick  to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera s  to me though  it makes the stories appeal much more life like and truly gut wrenching and sad also all of the characters are good  if you watch long enough  you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them  thus discovering what makes them tick  i must admit that the series has changes it has   it is emphasis a bit in recent years  in the first year there were numerous episode s that featured theme s or events from the investigator s home environment  especially stabler s   this trend has somewhat diminished over the years  yet you can still see each individual s background shining through into their work ethics  one thin i really had to get used to was richard belzer s  det  john munch  role getting smaller  it seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks  something i really enjoyed  but overall the series has not changed for the worse  for i feel it has actually improved  while a few years ago I had   I would given this series an   out of   I am much more inclined now to rate it even higher  what I have come to appreciate these last   or three years  were the additions of ice t  det  fin tutuola   b d  wong  dr  george huang  and stephanie march  a d a  alex cabbot  to the team  stephanie march s character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the d a s job is  but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice  huang s intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone  up until now   not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight  but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media s depiction of profilers in the silence of the lambs or the tv series profiler  also i think it is good  in addition to being very interesting  to',\n",
       "  ' show the public that not every offender is purely bad  but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface  as for ice t s character  i think he really completes the mix in the show  as the tough street cop  him and belzer are an ideal couple  just like benson  mariska hargitay  and stabler  christopher meloni  the reasons  i personally feel svu is the best crime series on the tube at the moment  are easily summarized  it has very much diversity  it offers insight into the psyche has   he is of both victim s and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect    out of   quality is the foundation that  law   order  special victims unit  is based upon  with compelling storylines  great performances and a first rate cast   law   order  special victims unit  radiates from the screen each hour it is on every night  dick wolf has combined quality writing with quality casting in the second of three series  in the  law   order  franchise mariska hargitay  christopher meloni  ice t  dann florek  b d  wong and richard belzer all share one thing in common  they star in one of finest series on television mariska  chris  ice t  dann  b  d  and stephanie march are a well rounded cast that bring great depth to their characters and compliment each other very well  furthermore  the cast portray their characters so well that i have to remind myself that they are actors not detectives quality writing and outstanding performances set  law and order  svu  apart from the other dramas on television  each episode is riveting  written with intelligence  and character driven  it is a privilege to watch  law   order  special victims unit  the writers  ability to draw viewers in and make them care about the involving storylines and characters help to make  law   order  svu  one of the finest legal series on television  ok let us start by saying i use to love this show  however this new season that has come out     is absolutely ridiculous  it has so many political views and bs left right motivation in it that it has lost me as a viewer  i do not even live in america  I am australian  i enjoyed it for what it was   law  and  order  i enjoyed seeing the crime and then the person hopefully being punished for it  now though  well according to the last episode i watched         it would appear it has gone all political  i understand keeping with the times but its a law and order show  none of that stuff needs to be in it  show some sort of rape abuse etc and then the investigation and court proceedings like you have been doing since    why bring all this alt left  alt right bs into now    personally i recommend skip anything new from this show and just go back to the original episodes where it was about the crime and solving it  not trying to push an agenda into your minds that in reality no one really cares about  i used to adore svu  watched it religiously  but regretfully this series should have retired gracefully instead of giving us endlessly telenovela illogical plots  based on emotions and nothing to do with the law  law and order it certainly is not  i hear on tv that apparently america s favorite law and order is the original  i personally think this is the best one out of all of them  it tackles some pretty intersting sides of society and humanity within an hour  I have been watching it for awhile and fell in love with the cast  they all have that hard edge that comes from doing a job like their s  marishka is great and ice t is amusing  the storylines are very interesting and groundbreaking  in my classes  I have heard about the down low phenomenon amongst black males in the u s  this is the first show  aside from oprah  that dealt with this issue  i was amazed and pleased that they shall   they will take on any topic within their framework  their guest cast should be praised as well  they have a great casting director  i do not know about their history with emmy nominations  but they should definitely be in the running  the show has a very easy going nature despite the hardness of the cast that works well and acted beautifully   it gives a real look at society s imperfections and discriminatory ideologies  nobody on the show is perfect and even the lawyers manipulate the law beyond the usual scope people think they do  instead  they are manipulating it to see justice done and not avoided  i would urge anyone to watch this show  give it a look  she has   he is the executive producer  and now the  executive actor   she dominates every plot  every action  every aspect of the show  the rest of the cast has been reduced to less than minor roles  moreover  this ruins the show s previous  police accuracy    cragen  ran the unit  benson runs the unit  personally conducts the investigation and interviews  makes the arrest  too much  the show needs to restore its balance  i started watching this on netflix as a binge show  i fell in love with the original cast from the beginning  stabler kept benson in check  and capt  kragen kept them both in check  then comes season    i think it was  that ends with stabler shooting the kid in their squad room  so no more stable to keep benson on track  then one of the best characters retires   sgt  munch  and the show needs a new sgt  so who else but benson gets it  oh and then kragen retires  and now they need a new leader  so obviously  this show is now the olivia benson show  it has   it is stopped being about the svu  it has   it is now a drama about benson  her kidnapping  her torture  her adoption  etc they need to get back on track and involve the rest of the cast more  like they used to do  this   man  or woman rather  team of olivia benson and her wishy washy law enforcement is getting really old  i finally made it through season    I am finding it very hard to make myself start watching season   leave the left partinship out of it  i want to be entertained when i turn off the news  not watch a scripted make believe version of an op ed  used to tune into law and order every now and then growing up  tuning into the newer seasons has ceased secondary to the blatenetly obvious bash course it chooses to take in all conservative values whilst pushing leftist garbage  no thanks and no thanks  i used to love this show but now it is just so far fetched  asinine or far left liberal storylines that it is just no longer enjoyable to watch  i think it has over stayed it has   it is welcome  the acting is haphazard  the characters are one dimensional and loathsome  and the writing is predictable and trashy  i hate this show so much  the only reason i joined imdb was to communicate to the world how odious this show is  please  if it is remotely within your capacity  take this show off the air  if you have a positive view of the world  of humanity  the government  or the criminal justice system  do not watch this show  it not only communicates the sensationalized myth of the need for fear  but it also depicts public officials as sinister  self  righteous villains for whom if violence could ever be justified  it would be justified against the characters portrayed as protagonists in this show  quality is the foundation that  law   order  special victims unit  is based upon as it illuminates from the screen each hour it is on every night dick wolf has combined quality writing with quality casting  mariska hargitay  christopher meloni  ice t  dann florek  b d  wong and richard belzer all share one thing in common  they star in one of finest series on television mariska  chris  ice t  dann  b  d  and the now departed stephanie march are a well rounded cast that compliment each other well  furthermore  the cast is so good portraying their characters that i have to remind myself that they are actors not detectives quality writing and outstanding performances set  law and order  svu  apart from the other dramas on television  each episode is riveting  written with intelligence  and character driven  it is a privilege to watch  law   order  special victims unit  the writers  ability to draw viewers in and make them care about the involving story lines and characters help to make  law   order  svu  one of the finest legal series on television  everyone must watch  another crime show that is being ruined by propagandistic infiltration  i have watched every episode  and i have been disappointed to see more politically charged episodes during the last   seasons  they clearly take sides  and they end up being disrespectful and undermining the very difficult jobs of law enforcement agencies including the police and ice  i will not watch another season  once was an alright show  now it has   it is all political  nothing but liberal rhetoric  stopped watching after last season  all the storylines are repetitive  terrible writing  nothing to hold the viewers interest  time to archive svu  maybe future generations will dig this out of the scrap pile and wonder why in the world anyone would waste their time watching this garbage  this show is such a disapointment political agenda and neverending pans of the characters faces mostly good old mariska and tired understanding feel good dialogue it used to be a great cop show now it should be shown about two oclock in the afternoon with the rest of the soap operas  l o  svu is by far the worst of the l o franchise  and one of the worst shows ever to appear on tv  any network  any language  it suffers from the late mash syndrome  where all minor characters have to have a part and are all buddy buddy  the writers cannot use jargon without immediately defining its social meaning  benson   he has   he is a pedophile   ice t   yeah     of pedophiles rape kids under    yo  word  mariska hargitay has one basic expression  shocked horror  and what has   what is with benson s one cure all for everything  talk therapy  no  dear  some things should be bottled up and never spoken of again they have something in for prep kids  what  was dick wolf turned down by the philip exeter academy or something it has   it is a bizarre combination of far left socializing plus far right tactics  yielding an overall effect eerily reminiscent of the cultural revolution in china why is richard belzer on this show  munch was a great character on homicide  they do not write to either his character or the actor s capabilities at all are these cops supposed to be nypd cops    new york   playing social worker  no  new york cops solve crimes  they do not play social worker  victims are chumps  perps are prey  bizarre where is the real  svu  horror of the welfare mom in a roach infested hovel starving the kids while hubby rapes them  it has   it is an incredibly  clean  show  in the dictionary of american tv jargon  this show is featured next to the phrase   jumped the shark   here s why the last episode of the current season  benson and the ada  do not remember her name  perform a surgical procedure on the medical examiner while she has   he is conscious and directing them  screeching in alleged pain  after the m e  been shot in the chest get real this travesty is clearly aiming for syndication on the lifetime channel or oxygen  better to kill it off now and put us out of our misery richard belzer and ice t ought to have their own spin off show  but a comedy this time   they had   they would be much more at home  this is not to say that they are not good at their craft  but simply that they have been given such wretched material over the run of the show  i could see them in their own  buddy cop  show  i might even watch it  the rest of them can rot in syndication  and dann florek can keep doing his gold commercials  apparently what he has   he is paid for them has  never been worth zero   unfortunately  this show has outlived its usefulness january    i cannot believe I am writing this  harry connick jr  has joined the cast as an  executive assistant to the da   is not  executive assistant  an overpaid secretary  the first thing that sprang to mind after i saw him in character on screen was  elvis movie   as a huge fan of harry connick s music  i am equally disappointed in his choice to take on this role  stiff and stumbling do not even begin to describe it  stick to jazz  harry  i do not know why they had to start making this show so political  i use to love this show  last season     i almost gave up on it  but pushed to the end hoping they would give us an evening of entertainment instead of putting our minds right back on the problems we are watching tv to forget about for a few minutes  they cannot seem to do it anymore  they lose the crime plot now for the political plot  n',\n",
       "  'ot the kind of show i like to watch  it you do then you will love it  for me i am no longer watching the show  i watch svu from beginning  even though i liked the original law and order better  but since cpt cragen retired and olivia benson assumed as lutenant  show took a wrong turn and there has   there is no law nor order in the show  it has   it is just all about left wing political bs all the time  and feminism  and all that crap should have retired the show gracefully now it has   it is just another show starring a boring  delusional sjw who sees bad in everything  oh olivia  what have they done to you    and about political correctness and all that bs     nowadays not for our surprise  the ratings from law and order svu are dropping hard  svu used to be one of my favourite shows  there has   there is been some incredible  edge of your seat episodes like      but now it has   it is mostly he said she said s and statutory rapes between two willing participants  i e    year old girl and   year old guy   yes  it has   it is more realistic and true to life  but that has   that is not why i watch tv like this  if i wanted realistic crime shows I had   I would watch highway cops or something   not law   order the political agenda pushing that has   that is become central to the show is beyond aggravating  as the most liberal  feminist  pro immigration  anti racist  anti fascist person around  having the views i already believe in forced down my throat every time I am trying to chill out and watch tv is frustrating  it has   it is also even more frustrating knowing how pointless it is   svu is a crime show  it has   it is not going to make anyone reconsider their politics  and it has   it is dumb to isolate people from a show they have enjoyed for decades just because their politics differ to yours  the way it has   it is all approached feels really patronising and tacky too   and the  my way is the right way  attitude is unhelpful in creating any positive political discussion season   has been better than the past few seasons   there has   there is been a few more engaging plot lines  it has   it is still not even close to how it used to be though  where virtually every episode was an     with   s being a common occurrence  now it has   it is more like every episode is a      and we are lucky if we get a   i do not watch the show regularly anymore  i just resort to it when there has   there is literally nothing else i can think of to watch  it sucks because it was so good  and i do not even think the new cast is too bad  yeah  they are not the og s  but i can deal with it if the plots are good   it seemed to get a lot worse when mariska hargitay took over as executive producer bring back engaging plots please and stop the political tripe     i watched svu a lot before but now it has   it is just soap all the way  just sad to watch really  this has become my favorite regular show on the main networks   the stories are good enough to keep me watching and the character interplay can be quite amusing at times   gibbs is great   watching the others react to him makes me chuckle   abby is perfectly believable  despite the goth overtones   she is strong  smart  yet still sexy and feminine   i think pauley perette was the ideal actress to cast   the writing seems to continue at an even keel   if nothing else getting better as more episodes are shown   i think the producers have a hit here   i go back each week   definitely worth your time   even if it means taping or tivo ing it  which i do    something to look forward to when i cannot make     on tuesday  and each episode speeds along all too quickly  i love this show\\x85  what is there not to like  rich story lines  strongly portrayed  and very human  personalities you can really warm to who play off each other brilliantly  all with their own distinctive quirks and \\x96 above all \\x96 the always wonderful mark harmon as main character  what more could you ask for in a show   there has   there is not a single character I had   I would change \\x96 none that irritate \\x96 they are all excellent  i consider it a bonus that it has   it is the one thing on tv that all our family equally enjoy for different reasons  even my father in law likes this and we normally have totally different viewing preferences  i was delighted when i heard that there was a second series imminent  only problem is that living in england  who knows how long after it has   it is shown in the us we will get to see it  fortunately it has   it is worth the wait  easily one of the best shows on television today  suspenseful  humorous and real not always pleasant or formulaic but real  just when i think bellesario has gone too far in the  lets screw up jag  sweepstakes  ok   episodes this year were actually good the rest terrible   he redeems himself with a show that is riveting  timely and funny at the right times the casting  the writing  the overall look of the show is first class  starting at the top with mark harmon  the sexiest man on tv he also sets the tone with his right on portrayal of the most conflicted man on tv today  his obsession with ari  the terrorist   his list of rules  then his tendency to think out of the box just adds to the spice and pace of this show   plus his constant dueling with dinozzo priceless  an added plus is the inter meshing of the cast david mccallum funny  urbane  so hot  his stories are hysterical  then his sad commentary on the life or death of their latest subject just gives you pause  his diatribe on the terrorist and what he did to his assistant alone is emmy award stuff do not mess with ducky ever again  then we have the reason for rule   special agent catlin todd the writers do not always have a clue as to her portrayal but she always pulls it off  and that humor of hers the end lines alone are great   i have to disagree as to the chemistry with gibbs kate it has   it is there all right hopefully we get to see something come of it in season    the actors portraying abby and dinozzo pauly perrette and michael weatherly are hysterical  yet right on in their portrayals especially when dinozzo thinks with his hormones and not with his brain then turns around and saves the day this show is a keeper  i can hardly wait for season    at first when my husband would watch this show i was not really paying much attention and i would see this goth girl in the lab and think   what on earth is that        then  one night i sat and watched along with him and now i am totally hooked  mark harmon s character appears to be annoyed sometimes by the other characters actions etc  but you get the feeling he really likes his coworkers  i like david mccallum s character and the way they tease him about going on and on  i get the feeling he knows they really do like him but his stories just get to be too much for them and he understands  my favorite though is pauley perrette s character  she is just a lot of fun  i hope the show stays on a long time  tuesday nights would not be the same with out it    zeva leaves  then tony and finally abby  the cast that built the legend on ncis has been reduced to a couple now and the new adds  except for maria bello  are not providing the intrigue and drama that was the previous ncis  as a devoted fan i am slowly but surely finding the show becoming a non  watch instead of a must see  we used to schedule our lives to make sure we never missed an episode  as ziva david  tony dinnozo  and abby have left the show  the show has become very lame and very uninteresting  tony once said   we need the pa  now i know what he was referring to all the pa s have left the show  and we are left with d  characters  basically kind of toward being a clear f in my opinion the tv show has lost it has   it is spark  which is very sad  when the show first aired it had a freshness to it and i really liked it a lot  actually gave it     stars  now i would only give it     stars we have decided not to continued to watch this in the following season s  to come i wish the characters well in the future season s  I have been a fan since the beginning and have watched every episode but with all the changes in the last year or two  the show has lost what made it great  the relationships between tony and kate and then tony and ziva added something special  tony s and abbey s personalities made it even better but now there has   there is just nothing  they took away what made the show great and did not add anything to make up for it  it also seems that mark harmon is tired of the show and it shows in his acting  he does not have the gusto he used to  unfortunately   ncis has gone downhill  become boring to watch  and i may not continue to do so  when the show first started out it was a little shaky  but since then has grown into its own  the characters are believable  both annoying and enchanting  and the plots are wonderful  there has   there is a depth and a comradeship that is not often showed this well in television  it is not forced or faked  it has   it is entirely true to life and believable  the underlying sexual tension between several of the characters is also intriguing and interesting to watch  the most obvious of these being the relationship between tony and kate  but there has   there is also hints at kate and gibbs  mcgee and abby  and so on  it has   it is a crime drama that has   that is both serious and light hearted  and a wonderful show for anyone who likes fascinating stories  good humor  and great character interaction  tony dinozzo  michael weatherly  was the character that really made this show come to life for me  he was interesting  a film buff and very unlike the typical gungho cop you get in shows like this  when he left  and i know there were characters leaving before him  it left a huge gap that the new stable of characters just cannot fill  in fact there have been a few newbies come in since he left and they are all so boring i cannot even think of their first names  now abby has also left and so we really only have jethro  ducky and probie left  probie was always a supporting character a good straight man to dinozzo  jethro worked well with the original cast but now looks bored but happy to be raking in the cash  ducky is still interesting but not on the show as often as he used to be  and the others  who cares  not much left in the way of talent   the tim character is now flat and uninspired  the abbey replacement is more a cartoon character  and the scripts are uninspired  too bad   no longer interested in ncis  finally bellisario got it right   gibbs and his gang are first and foremost investigators  not hoity toity staff officers who moonlight as stereotyped combat soldiers with thickly laid on patriotic dogma that would make ward carroll vomit with rage   at no time do they ever try to borrow an f   to go on some bombing raid over the international hot spot du semaine  they stick to their job descriptions the whole time   they also have personalities and eccentricities that make them a better ridealong than overstarched harmless rabbit and whatever babe he happens to be working with this season  such as gibbs  coffee addiction  ducky s intellectual ramblings  dinozzo s attempts at being a cool womanizer  abby s interesting blend of science nerd and goth grrrl  and kate as the token vaguely normal neophyte thrown into the mix   too bad this could not have been done with jag in the first place  I have written about this show before on imdb     but here i am months later in may   and yet it still continues to be impressive  there have been a few shows that were  bleh  in the last season but the  swak  episode tonight really got a few great moments of emotion between the cast members  the writers  at least to me  were able to pull off the  suspended disbelief  and i got pulled into the moment as dinozzo was about to kick the bucket  i sure hope they keep most of the cast in the next season  as they seem to play off each other brilliantly  the only cast member i could see losing  according to the season finale preview  they lose an ncis agent  is mcgee  he has   he is great and believable for his role  but any of the others lost as regulars on the show would break down the core character interplay  the mcgee character could be replaced   but the others would be much more difficult  but then again i guess this is all decided and in the can   we will find out on may    my comments to other viewers that have commented on the reality of the series     yeah  it has   it is not the real life ncis at all  but real life would be mind numbin',\n",
       "  'gly boring to fit in   minute tv show  you had   you would need the constant buzz of fluorescent lights in the background combined with pages and pages of forms being typed into the computer     mostly about drug abuses by young   year olds  this is tv drama and a fabricated fiction  i appreciate the nod bellesario gives to ncis and like the show for the entertainment it is  real life ncis is not a fun job  but we get an hour on tuesday night to pretend it is  same old stories over and over  gibbs is way to old  they would not have a man of his years in the lead  it has   it is farcical ncis los angeles is much better escapism  just finished binge watching season   and i have watched this show since the beginning  maybe the producers or whomever are trying to set a record for the length of the series  but there is little other reason for this show to continue  the exit of vital characters like ziva   dinozzo has created a downward slide into mis casting key roles and creating dubious plots  the one bright spot in casting is reeves  the   transplant   both the actor and the character bring a breath of fresh air to the otherwise dowdy team  the loss of vance s wife and ziva s father was a preposterous plot twist  the addition of quinn and torres to fill the gaps in the ncis team is weak and failing  quinn has nothing to do and torres does not belong there  neither character is interesting nor entertaining in any way  maybe  like reeves  the producers should have considered another foreign import  french or swedish   to add some dimension  bishop is marginally effective as an analyst  but is not believable as a field agent  it would have been better to keep her married and have her be the nerdy info bank who gathers and sorts backgrounds   personality profiles  even if it were a smaller role  that kind of role would be a fair replacement for the departing abby  and bishop s tricky relationship with her nsa lawyer husband would have brought new fodder to episodes  and why do we have to be subjected to jimmy palmer s buffoonery in every episode  said buffoon scenes becoming longer with each passing season  I am also now very tired of franks showing up in a delusion to drive a story  kind of pathetic  there is lots more i could say but basically it has   it is time for this series to go out with some dignity left  i know the show has been slated for a   season but i cannot imagine it getting any better if it stays on the same path  i have watched every episode but the new abby replacement stinks  hope they find a better replacement soon  what started out as an amazing series for many years has declined over the past few and had unfortunately become something rather senile  occasionally serious with a lot of something which appears to try to imitate humor but greatly lacks it and sadly the wit is gone i knew she was coming as soon as i heard the character was leaving and duckys assistant arrived  no thanks it is a shame they killed off   officer  now im wondering if he will be replaced i may just quit watching this now  i am very disappointed with this season s cast changes  i have been a loyal fan of ncis from the very beginning  I have always enjoyed the show and thought the writing was great and the characters were believable  but jennifer esposito has all but ruined the show for me  i find her to be rude  arrogant  obtrusive and obnoxious  she definitely does not fit in with the team  wilmer valderrama may eventually fit in  once he learns that he is there to work  not to flirt with every skirt on the show and search for apartments while he is supposed to be working a crime scene  also  the writing has taken a decided turn for the worse   the character s parts are all over the place  and it seems they have no idea what they are doing with jimmy palmer this season  the show used to be balanced  told a good story  and treated all of the characters well  now it seems they have lost their way caring more about jumping on the politically correct  diversity  and inclusive bandwagon than with creating the award winning show they have had for all these years  very sad to see such a great show fall apart like this      spoilers ncis  the ncis  navy criminal investigative service  is a service that investigates on any kind of crime  from barroom brawls to international terrorism  that involves men and women from the navy or marine corps the team is formed by  leroy jethro gibbs  the second b stays for bastard   mark harmon   the moody  intuitive head investigator  he likes his coffee very strong  his women with red hair  and his investigations thorough  it is rare to get a compliment for him  when you get one  do not ask why  he is very loyal  and actually cares for his team  but has problems with women  evidence of this being three failed weddings   anthony dinozzo  michael weatherly   gibbs     a smartmouth  player to the soul and proud of it  who masks his quick mind and powerful intuition with a happy go lucky  and sometimes obnoxious  attitude  sometimes he can behave in quite the juvenile way  and when he is  a good headslap by gibbs will help him put things straight  this two have also what could possibly be the strongest homosexual subtext   more of an almost text   in tv history   he enjoys to torment someone  usually the newest element of the team  dearly departed special agent kate todd  more later  and special agent tim mcgee  more later  have suffered the brunt of that in various occasions  comes from money  but does not get an allowance because if he did  he would not work  and it seems there is bad blood between him and his family  he has a deep love of movies and tv shows  one of his favorites is  ozzy and harriet    and referred to movie acquired knowledge various times kate todd  sasha alexander   killed in the season   finale  who came from secret service  and made a point of bringing it up whenever the occasion presented itself  and came off as quite the uptight girl  all in all  the weakest character in the show  though her witty  hepburn tracy  rapid fire dialogues with dinozzo were great  and she had with him the strongest hetero almost text this side of gil grissom and catherine willows abby sciuto  pauley perrette  a perky goth  not as oxymorous as it sounds  who has an imprecise number of tattoos on her body and is the greatest at her job  she loves to hear techno or hard rock music  like android lust  played at a very loud volume while working  she is the only person in the team gibbs actually shows affection for  and she is currently dating special agent tim mcgee  more later  tim mcgee  sean murray   who joined the team in the second season after making various guest appearances throughout the first season  tim is a computer whiz  but is at a loss when it comes to social life  has gotten a tattoo on his butt to impress sciuto   and it worked  has been mercilessly teased by dinozzo when he first joined the team  getting the absolutely not flattering nickname  probie    pivello    greenhorn   in the italian version   he has proved his valor  though  time and time again and last but not least  donald  ducky  mallard  david mccallum   the me  who has two curious habits  one  to talk to the corpses he is going to autopsy  and the other  to go off on tales that are very loosely related to the case in question  he likes the music abby plays  but not distorted by speakers  lives with his mother  who  wearing only chanel n°  when she goes to bed  hosts very awkward slumber parties and has various dogs  he is the one who has worked the longest with gibbs and looked like  ilya kuryakin  when he was younger this is the team  I am not talking about ziva and madame director because i have yet to see season     and my suggestion is to watch them in action  every tuesday      central  on cbs you will not be disappointed ncis       season   started with a bang with ziva making a   episode return  now she has gone and with her any talented script writers it has now returned to the smaltzy dribble it has been since ziva left if you like this sort of thing watch the waltons   this is now a program this is long past its best  i guess all the time it makes money it will run  oh for the days of tony  abby  kate and ziva            oh  what an engaging show this used to be    i still remember episodes from more than a decade ago with sasha alexander  ziva was a solid replacement  ably supported by tony and ducky  gibbs was a no nonsense  high and tight marine  there was action  there was intrigue  there was natural humor  there were genuinely poignant moments even during the slower  more personal scenes  those moments were moving because they felt real and because they involved characters we cared about the past couple of years have upturned almost all of that  almost all the core personalities are gone  those still there  gibbs  mcgee  and  occasionally  ducky  have been emasculated to the point where you begin wondering if mcgee and jimmy are going to start making out during one of their heart to hearts  gibbs is becoming more of a senile grandpa with each episode  other characters have come and gone  the gorgeous jennifer esposito  the black english dude  mcgee s disabled wife    as for the shrink  jack  and the new abby  a k a  a female steve urkel   the less said the better  torres and bishop are okay but they are never going to fill the shoes of ziva david and anthony dinozzo  i think the only character worth his salt anymore is director vance then there has   there is the storylines and plots  the show has taken on a distinctly politically correct tone  seasons   has so far managed to dredge up racism form the   as well as feature sermonizing about the environment      and that has   that is just two episodes  it has   it is now a hybrid of the gilmore girls  lethal weapon  and dr  phil it pains me to say it but this show is well past its sell by date  it has   it is time to put it out of its misery  may this season      be the last so the show is retired with  some   albeit not much  dignity left    these story lines used to be about naval personnel and the problems they encountered   with the ncis team helping resolve them anymore  most of these programs are about the  personnel interactions  between team members  for example  tony and ziva  for weeks and weeks  he has been trying to get her back from israel and get her to love him  this has become so tiresome   tiresome   tiresome and gibbs storyline involving shooting down some of his own friends is to far out of his to date character line that it is amost comical  to say the least please  writers  whatever you do  please get off this track  you are losing fans  earlier seasons are very good  with a lot of strong  interesting characters  todd  ziva  tony  abby  ducky  mcgee  gibbs      after so many main characters exited the show  they were replaced with extremely mediocre ones  quinn  sloane  torres  or jackson  etc    the one replaced abby was the worst  do not bother watch the current season  it has   it is simply garbage now  this is a great series to watch   i have been hooked on this show since the beginning because i love watching mysteries and crime like csi and csi miami   harmon s so sexy in this role and mccallum is always a joy to watch as ducky especially when he has   he is on the role over various anthropology lectures which to my amusement everyone on that shows roll up their eyeballs  this show used to be in my top   must not miss shows every week until season    i honestly do not know what they were thinking when they forced bishop   kasie on us  those   have ruined the show for me  i can tolerate the other   newbies  torres   sloane  to a point  but they too are not   am not the best fit either  it was great to bring back ziva this season as an attempt to keep us interested  but it has   it is a little too late because the damage has already been done the last few seasons  i can no longer watch without cringing every time bishop   kasie are on the screen because they just do not belong on this show  so many other loyal fans have said the same things   it amazes me they have not replaced these horrible characters yet  but maybe the plan is to end the show  so they figure why bother writing in better characters  anyway  i just want to say how much i truly enjoyed every season up to    i put up with most of season   only because i love jennifer esposito   wanted to see where that was going  but the minute they forced that out of nowhere relationship bishop had onto us   then had her go all crazy   murder that g',\n",
       "  'uy it made me sick to my stomach to watch after that  i actually forced myself to keep watching just because i kept thinking things would change   that maybe bishop would get fired for what she did or get demoted  since that has   that is what it seemed was going to happen  except nothing happened  i guess the writers just gave up trying after that  i finally stopped watching it weekly after kasie joined the team  though because she has   he is the absolute worst fit of any character that has   that is ever been on the show   i just could not stomach watching it after that  last month i went back to try   catch up before this new season started by trying to skip through the parts when she came on   parts where it was just bishop  too  but it has   it is just not worth the trouble  so i am officially done watching for good now  it has   it is such a shame how they made it so many seasons picking good characters that fit well with each other   with gibbs  but then they just stopped trying after season    thanks for   great seasons at least  you have failed this show  the first two seasons were brilliant   meaningful flashbacks  great villains  good pacing  fitting dark tone season   had a drop in quality  and season   completely butchered a fantastic show  in season     horrible meaningless flashbacks  worse acting  terrible villains  unfitting lighter tone  illogical story lines with many plot holes  more like a soap opera than a superhero crime drama tv show  butchering of major story lines like andy diggle  oliver s child  hiverating for season   and          rating for season          rating for season        after episodes of trying and trying i have fainlly stopped watching arrow  left it midway season    season   and   of the show were pure gold  season   the show got a little sloppy  season   was just terrible  season   went surprisingly good and season   is just very boring and and terrible the show lost its spark after season   and arrow  s new  team  is just unbearable  if you compare it with team flash  the show lost its billionaire playboy charm and the dark cool arrow long back  even felicity and diggle are annoying now  it feels like greg berlanti just lost his focus from the show i hope they gain back the season   spark  the first   seasons of the show was amazing however after that it got stale and boring  i decided to give up less than half way through season    the flashbacks become uninteresting  the villains after   seasons are boring  love story is soap opera material  season   made the show unrealistic with the sci fi magic  arrow was more interesting when he was working alone without any sidekicks  an excellent show till season    from season   show started to decline  season   is a mess  slow  boring and totally confusing  from half season   episodes  production introduced some new characters to the show  the main characters sons and daughters  in an inconsistent and confusing manner and in a different timeline  probably they decided to cancel the original show and are preparing the way for a new show  arrow sons    in the future  i am only watching it because i am curious how they will end it  i used to love this show  when it began  the mere athleticism of stephen amell used to give me goosebumps and i would have rated it an    even    but with the passing of time  i think somewhere around season     the quality of writing started dropping  actors can do only so much  and they do give their best every time  with this kind of material  some characters have become sort of hangers on and should be put out of their misery i sure hope things pick up in season    this was one of the best tv shows you watch for comic book genre  it started of great well lit up scenes with loads of action  suspense and a good story line  suddenly all of that was thrown out and made a weak series in which the main character reveals himself all the time and the action is terrible to watch  no suspense  no general direction of the character  in almost every episode its the same dialogue  oliver if you want them to trust you  you should let them know who you are  and oliver takes of his eye piece and says  i am the green arrow  l o l what dafuq the show is just going down hill  specially that now the main character is now felicity  sleeps with all the billionaires and take their fortune and keeps them under her payroll  worst character  thea queen   billionaire famous line  i am out   just keep the group small and the action hardcore like   season  identity reveal yeah stop that  let the character start killing again  and please do not bring dead people back to make their own show season     great  season     just ok  season     what is happening season     why are you killing the show  season     i give up  cant watch anymore  season     stopped watching  this show started off great from season    onto season    then it began to slow down a bit in season   and    but it picks up again with action in season    there are many story line build ups  and great flashbacks  and it also compliments with the action and fight scenes  one major critic of the show will be how the writers will often attempt to put in too many love sequences in a super hero show  another will be how the story does not follow up as well with the green arrow comics  if the show sticks to its action first and love story later  it will stay more consistent to what fans would love to see  and this will keep the show alive for a longer number of seasons  the best part of this show is that it provides its viewers with crossover episodes  and team ups with other super hero shows such as the flash  these crossover episodes provides more action and delivers a comic book genre type of team up for fans or even non comic book fans to enjoy  on a side note  season   of this show is by far the best tv show season i have ever watched  even if you do not have time watching this show  just watch season    you will not regret it  it has   it is becoming so boring that every bad guy in the series has more brains  more skills and more bravery than oliver queen  it has failed the fans making the arrow a weak  troublesome individual that really anybody can defeat  start making him more astute  more strong  and wiser than his enemies  the series is plagued with oliver s failures to succeed  you have a great potential for the series do not waste it on stupid writing  we want to see a strong arrow not a weak one defeated by everybody  make him a winner again  team arrow is pretty lame  it has   it is like they went from a show for adolescents and adult to a show for kids the first two seasons were incredible but from there henceforth it has   it is kinda boring arrow    i was looking forward and waiting this show to start  but from season to season its get more unwatchable    last season with the kids    come on  please make the next season be the final one    it was tolerable up to season    that has   that is where everyone became emotional extremists and critically irrational for most of the show  there are inconsistencies  events that make no sense  too much hypocrisy from every character who demands respect and honesty but continuously lies and disrespects in every episode  the arrow team plans fail   percent of the time making them look incompetent  evil is portrayed as stronger and smarter  while good is portrayed as stupid and weak  the only way to win is by luck and not skill for the arrow team  really disappointing that said  i enjoy the performance of the actors and will continue to watch  even though it feels like I am sticking needles in my eyes at times with everything this series irritates me with  i can no longer watch  although i still like the key characters and how they use to be in earlier seasons  i cannot stand the whole stupid diaz storyline  he gets away with everything    as if   so unrealistic  illogical and cartoonish the villains are so so evil and yet they always have the upper hand  and the heroes are presented as too weak to prevail not too mention that agencies supposedly on the good side of the law also side against the heroes   i mean    really no wonder there is so many bullies in the real world  they are in most tv shows today  and they are always in top positions  i want to be entertained  not annoyed and frustrated  sorry stephen amell  I am a fan of yours but you have to speak up to the producers and writers  they are failing you  i was kind of sketchy when i first heard about this series  considering the terrible job that was done with  the cape   I am pleased to say that all of my doubts were unfounded  arrow is a darn good show  and the first pilot episode is very strong and leaves little confusion behind this vigilante s origins  i felt that the main actor properly conveys a somber and mature attitude in contrast to the description we receive of him as a partying playboy before the shipwreck  the action is intense and not over the top or completely unbelievable  what we are presented with is a young man whose   years spent on an island have shaped him up into an agile warrior tasked with cleaning up his city from corruption  i cannot wait to see what lies in store through future episodes  and i certainly hope this show delivers the goods  so far  i believe we are in store for some quality television this fall  i have seen all   episodes of arrow  and honestly I am pretty impressed  i believe this is inspired by nolan s dark knight trilogy  but i do not think that it has   it is a ripoff  for me  the show is never boring  it is like the combination between teen drama and the dark knight trilogy  speaking of realism  this show is not realistic at all  oliver with diggle and felicity seem to have any solution to every kind of problems  well it does not matter at all since this is a comic book adaptation  as much as i love this show  i still think the show is so flawed  the cast are not   am not that good  well they are okay  sometimes what really bothers me is the dialogs  it is so f in cliché  the dialog is so fake that has   that is filled with cheesy words that we had   we would never say in real life  what i like most about the show are the action and the plot  the plot is very good  the crimes never seem to end  and i loved every episode in the series as much as how flawed the show is  it has   it is pretty darn entertaining  it has   it is obviously not breaking bad or game of thrones  but it has   it is one of the most entertaining shows in tv today   let us take a moment of mourning for the tv plot arcs of yore  back when shows prioritized the characterizations above the action and  if indeed there was action  it took place precisely in the last   minutes of the episode  and was all done with before the close  giving the characters a chance to make light comic banter  close down the storyline  and give the audience a chance to go to the toilet  how many tv shows followed that formula i cannot say  but the number was in the    now all that has changed  you can now have action many times in the body of a show  it is permitted  even encouraged  and you have action even before the characterizations are fully developed  all this is positive evolution i think  but here the catch  there are no more  closed  story lines  in the multi band  multi channel  multi device electronic age  where viewers tend to have attention span of a hummingbird  nighttime tv has astonishingly borrowed the rule book of daytime soap operas and  lo   plots never actually resolve  they just become more complex  arrow is one of the best exponents of the new type of comic book derived drama  arguably as good as or even better than smallville  which was  thematically  all over the map   amell is great  he has a whispery kind of delivery which oddly makes what he says that much more interesting  the supporting cast is great  in fact the only thing that prevented me from giving this a     are the flashbacks  they are terrible  they are like some silent hell the viewers must go through to get back to the actual episodes  it is almost as if the lead writer  as a small child  was locked in a closet with a dvd looping kung fu  and grew up to believe that you cannot advance   minutes of plot in the present  without   minutes of flashback to fortify it   this review is written after having seen episodes     only  who the hell decided to give the green light for this series in this state  honestly  the people who made this must have never read a comic book in their lives first off  let us get the good things out of the way  the plot is ',\n",
       "  'very promising and so far it has   it is the only thing that keeps me going  and the cinematography effects are not bad  but they could use a little polish here and there  especially the choreography of some fight scenes     stars from here  now what is wrong with this series  they failed on every level to deliver us a show about a superhero  they took the idea of the green arrow and crapped all over it firstly  the green arrow is supposed to be an incredibly stoic and cynical character when he is monologuing  with a witty tongue reserved for his foes  someone who used to be a very naive young man once  but who was slapped in the face with the realization that the society around him is rotten to the core  so he sets off in a crusade to even the balance between the poor and the rich and bring some justice to his corner of the world with only his excellent archery skills as a weapon  as a modern day robin hood  now  the background story the series shows about him being stranded on the island shows this very good  however  his monologues are not as thought provoking  philosophizing or caustically cynical as they appear in the comic books  i will give the actor though another star because after watching the first couple episodes  he is honestly trying to improve his character and deliver his poorly written lines in an arrow like manner  kudos to you sir for actually caring  secondly  alas the efforts of one person are overshadowed by the failures of the rest of the acting crew  plastic dolls posing in shop windows have better acting skills than this lot  first and foremost is the annoying ex girlfriend laurel whatever her name who delivers her lines in the most crude way possible  i can see her thinking trying to remember what she has   he is supposed to say or what emotion to show in her face  it has   it is like watching a baboon school play  the writing of her character does not help either  we are supposed to accept that after   years she is still in love with the guy who cheated on her with her friggin sister  and who is responsible for her death  and how about his mother that apparently killed her husband  but threatens to raise hell if a hair of one of her family is even touched and then we come to the third and most crucial failing of this series  this is supposed to be a series about a superhero  i do not care at all about the sex life of his ex girlfriend  i do not care about the sister s drinking problem  i do not care about the social life of anyone  partly  because they fail as characters  but mostly because this is a series about a superhero  this is not the days of our lives  or sex   the city  I am not expecting to watch romantic crap about women on their period  I am expecting to watch a superhero kick ass  bring justice to the wicked and perform some general pwnage  do not get me wrong  i can understand showing how his actions to hide his alter ego affect those around him and how in turn he is affected himself  i like to see some inner conflict in my super heroes  what i do not like is the green arrow being a supporting actor in his own series  an average episode goes about   minutes and   of those are spent showing us uninteresting flirting between his friends and family  then the green arrow steps in the room and says he has to go  to fight bad guys  but instead of following him  we are stuck for another     minutes to witness the constant crying of his friends and family of how he never spends time with them i do not care     seriously  imagine watching a series about batman  that all it does is show catwoman talk to her girlfriends about how she is in love with a really cute guy called clark kent  yes clark kent  that has   that is how messed up arrow is  a terrible effort and an outright insult  do not waste your time  at least for now it has   it is still pretty early in the production  only   episodes so far  and as i said the plot seems interesting  perhaps the cw network will come around to realizing how much more they could do with this series and improve it later on in the season  one can only hope  season   was mediocre  but season   has a huge drop in quality  shoutout to marc  franchise slaughterer  guggenheim   if you are a fan of the series  do yourself a favor and stop watching  the flash is really hitting it has   it is stride if you are desperate for cw superhero shows  this season of arrow is just a crudely stitched together collection of tumblr fanfics  the characters have lost any real personality  and just serve to move the plot forward  this season is plagued by writers using half  baked concepts to push the  plot  forward by brute force   they frequently make decisions that defy any form of logic as well as any character traits of note  any development that the characters have made in the past seasons has just disappeared  seemingly because they oppose guggenheim s mary sue couple  also it would be a misconception to think that the villain is the basis of any overarching plot  he has   he is just a side note to said couple  really this season seems to lack any direction whatsoever  it has   it is like the writers are giving up on trying to provide any cohesive story  and to make it worse  while they could look back to some of the source material for some good ideas  they spit in its face in favor of their own rambling mess as a side note  i feel that the length of this show has been a huge detractor from the start  even in it has   it is glory days  the seasons probably could have been trimmed in half or lower and tell the same story  a lot of the time on this show is wasted on silly stuff  and could it could be a huge improvement to trim down the story to something more concise and save more for the effects budget  but honestly  is nobody in the studio checking up on them  was this really looked at and approved by real people in the entertainment business  it boggles my mind that this could make it to air on such a well known show  the cw s superhero shows have always been aimed at a more  teeny  audience  but at the levels that guggenheim has taken it to  it seems like he would be better off writing those fanfics and letting someone with moderate respect for the story s integrity take over  i love the actors in this and wish them the best  but the only hope i can see for this show is to retcon this season and get a fresh team of writers because this may be the biggest train wreck i have ever witnessed make the air  save yourself the time with this one unless your less than about   years old or have a very low iq it has   it is like the ideas been pieced together from other shows  it has   it is stupid  inconsistent  hypocritical  ridiculous  and most of the acting is terrible it has   it is a pity because the underlying story with the mother and her associates is the shows only redemption  you just have to sit through the agony of the rest of the show to get this  maybe they should save us all the heartache and just tell us what happens with that story line  ok  just seen the first episode and i think it was amazing  i am not the biggest fan of comics or very knowledgeable about green arrow in general  so i feel i can be very objective in reviewing this show like i would any regular one  without fan love ideas or huge expectations  the characters seem very believable so far  few minor doubts here and there but nothing crucial  acting also up to part  story is realistic  without that fantastical loop holes that comic adaptations usually have  was told green arrow was like that in comics too  so i respect the decision to stay with that   cgi was decent  compliments to stunt collection and fighting choreography  well done  sir  well done   and quite good screenplay for this episode  the makers opened quite a few questions  made room for many ways show can stream to  i can say without a doubt  that this show is one of the surprises of this fall and i can only hope that the whole season lives up to this great pilot  I am not sure why arrow has an     rating  pretty high for an overly boring  almost laughable show first of all  why does oliver always seem to feel the need to have sex with every woman he encounters  second  why does everyone come back from the dead  and third  why does every villain they come across somehow related to the island oliver was stranded in for five years do not get me wrong  i do like the concept  I am sure this would have been an amazing show if the script  or the plot  or the actors were not so horrible  i find myself always laughing at the dumb things the characters say do  the plot does not make sense at all  there has   there is nothing remotely interesting or not ridiculous in it  and the characters are just as laughable  how did they cast these actors exactly  was there even an audition or were they just going for the prettiest faces that came their way this used to be a good show  the first few episodes were good  that is  somehow  it took a turn for the absolute worst  like many others here  i thoroughly enjoyed season      and   was alright    was where it really went down hill with poor plot and acting which overall lost the more gritty feel to arrow  season   however really brought it back for me with an amazing villain and interesting plotline  despite this i dropped out midway season   as again the story became sloppy  repetitive and uninteresting which is a real shame for a show that really does have it has   it is high points  highly recommend just watching through to the end of season   and leaving it there  probably just watch a season recap or something on season   as its really not worth the watch  I have watched all   seasons of arrow  and its been quite the journey  but the quality has been dropping with each new season  i can no longer justify spending my time watching this show  as it just is not good anymore  nothing about story is interesting  no good villains  plots and schemes  everything is predictable     this show is almost indescribably bad  it makes me angry just to think about caveat  i do not know a whole lot about green arrow  his name is oliver queen  he gained his skills while marooned on an island  he has   he is rich  and he is so easy to make fun of  but this is not an attack on the concept  I have seen sillier concepts work out to be much better shows arrow is one of those shows where wooden acting  poor directing  and writing about on par with the twilight saga come together to create one of the most offensive television experiences i have ever had  and I have seen jersey shore stephen amell as the titular hero green arrow and katie cassidy as laurel are particularly bad  with approximately one and a half facial expressions between them and a penchant for removing themselves from the room as the standard method of showing anger  you could make a drinking game out of it  truly the writing is staggeringly awful  however  when i say  writing   I am not speaking about the plot  that might yet unravel over time  but it has   it is too early to tell  what i mean is the actual words which come out of people s mouths  there is a specific scene which comes to mind where oliver and his best friend  tommy  are seated at a table  discussing their friendship  tommy reveals that he has   he is been sleeping with laurel  and oliver s only reaction is   that has   that is okay  i forgive you   i closed my eyes for this scene and realized that i could not even tell who was saying what at certain points  they have no verbal mannerisms  and the  funny  best friend has no real sense of humor that i could discern  plus  his jokes plain suck  but i guess that has   that is a minor point  all things considered  i should point out that  recently  a friend told me that tommy merlyn turns into green arrow s nemesis  which means they of course have a lot in common and might seem like the same person at times  but that does not really come across as purposeful on this show the directing is maybe the worst offender  here  because a good director could turn cruddy actors and poor writing into something downright entertaining  just look at sam raimi s work on spider man   and    instead  i find myself imagining david barrett or john dahl or any number of the other directors on this show  sitting there texting while scenes are happening  maybe eating a sandwich or something  not paying attention must be hungry work I am getting into a lot of detail  so I am just going to cut this off and say that i should have seen it coming  just look at the promo picture  really consider it  that was the very first thing w',\n",
       "  'e were shown regarding this series  ask yourself what that says about their priorities  the universe of star trek has done something brilliant to keep alive   the creators have imposed a story arch for all the series starting with    do not get me wrong   tng was what got me into star trek in the first place  it had vibrant characters  unique ideas  and was the building block for setting the stage for the other series and the later movies   however  in all it has   it is glory  it lacked something   continuity   the longest the crew of the enterprise d would have to deal with an immediate situation  was no more than   episodes   no doubt things would reoccur  but it was seldom  voyager  however  would have numerous back to back episodes dealing with something   and that might even resurface somewhere down the line i cannot understand what people dislike so much about this show   they explored so much more than any of the others   not just in the unverse  but with the crew   they all grew   some more than others  but you cannot go   years and not show growth in a character   and as with every other star trek  it was rough at first  but it gets so much better once the writers and the actors have about a year or two to get it right i truely believe that if people give it a chance and do not jump on the bandwagon  they had   they would like it   it has   it is easy to say you do not like something if you have never really given it a chance  if imdb had a way of getting a blood pressure reading on some of the users making comments for this show  the results would be frightening   there has   there is no reason to ever get that worked up over a program   I have never been able to understand why a person would watch an entire seven year series  hating it all the way   option  turn the channel   you have got nothing to lose   it has   it is not like in the theater where one might sit through a tepid movie because they paid admission   voyager was free   take it or leave it personally  i enjoyed the show   i liked the plot  the cast  and most of the storylines   i appreciated the mix of drama and action   voyager  in my opinion  was a very good program   had i not felt good about it    i would have turned it off   problem solved not every series is going to be a masterpiece   not everyone is going to like every show   if it has   it is your cup of tea  drink it   if not  put the cup down  i had to respond to someone who said this was the worst of the franchise  i happen to favor    but voyager has many great qualities including cast and unique plots  captain janeway was an excellent addition to the captains of star trek  let us not forget the criticisms that james kirk had during the beginnings of his work in star trek  the ensemble worked well together  slowly but surely over seven seasons and there were many truly memorable segments  chakotay  tuvok  blana  tom    of    kes  harry  neelix  the doctor  at the end named joe  each and every one developed into a character you liked each and every week  irrespective of the episode  they grew even better over time  although i wondered how chakotay and the captain never got together and on occasion how blana and tom did and the final episode a two parter was truly a great ending to the show there is no edge like there is in    just questions on how they are going to get home  and it is the third of this group so it gets compared to st tng sometimes unfavorably  but  just as the ensemble was great in each  so as it is in voyager  if you take the time to watch the first season you will want to see each and every episode and feel badly when it all ends  wanting more that is just not forthcoming criticize if you will  but the current enterprise could take some notice of the great ensemble of the previous star trek s and the wonderful writing that kept many turning in week after week and continue in syndication i just recently purchased the full seven seasons on dvd and saw it again after its television airing  the show is even better than when i first wrote about it  each show stands alone with compelling story lines that are creative in their design and resolution  the franchise of star trek  from its inception in the   s through voyager should continue in some form other than conventions  there is a void for good stories  writing and ensembles  contrary to what many trek nerds would have you believe  voyager is not the worst star trek series  and is not at all a bad show  the acting is superior to that on the beloved the next generation  that comment alone will probably have people throwing their spock ears at their monitors   and i think many of the stories were better  tng stories always seemed to revolve around spacial anomalies and holodeck malfunctions  which became excruciatingly boring  i was not interested in seeing picard dressed up like sherlock holmes and trying to solve a fake mystery  only to be trapped on the holodeck and have the safety mechanisms shut off  as many times as this happened  i would have shut the silly thing down and prohibited its use voyager was so great because it truly put its protagonists into a situation that they could not extricate themselves from  for the first time since the original   s series  star trek characters truly went where nobody had gone before  discovering new races and acquiring knowledge  and they could not call on the federation to save them and no doctor has ever been as good in his role as robert picardo  that even includes deforest kelly  who was exceptional  jennifer lien was also outstanding as kes  who was very much missed after her departure from the series voyager brought back a lot of the adventure that was inherent in the first star trek series  and was lost in tng  perhaps it did not live up to its enormous potential  but it was still a very good series that is  unfortunately  far to often the target of hate by tng purists and people who like to pick at microscopic details  here in the netherlands  star trek voyager was on the tv every   days of the week  I have never payed much attention to this since i am not the biggest fan of since fiction and sorts of movies and series like it  one day  nothing was on and i decided to lower myself to the  level  star trek was on  from that moment on  i did not knew what i was saying before i began watching it every day  until i discovered i dropped right there in to the middle of season    which was pretty bad for me  since i had no clue what so ever how they got to the delta quadrant  where in war with the kazon and who  kes  was  i decided i just had to afford the \\x80    euro   dvd box  this box was kept in storage somewhere behind my schoolbooks  until i missed a couple of episodes because of my weekly and daily responsibilities  i decided to start all over again and watch the entire series without subtitles or synchronization  pure all american humor and language that is from that moment on  i knew what was going on  and how they got where they were  including what happened to them  i did not gave up watching star trek voyager on tv  since there were still subtitles included on tv  it simply drew me back in all over again   which i did not mind at all  my initial misgivings suddenly disappeared and i began to be a huge fan of the series  i used to stay up all night watching it and i still do  after watching every single episode more than   times  since i have not gotten into all the other series  voyager still raised above my expectations and for sure it amazed my how  modern  it was for that time of year therefor i want to conclude  everyone who is interested in sf  star traveling  interesting plot twists and more  should definitely watch this series  i gave it a definite     it was great  some blah episodes  like all trek  but great when it was great  do yourself a favor  if you like tng and   watch voyager voyager  though different in many ways than other star trek series  is nonetheless a great chapter in the star trek saga  the characters are well developed  and the unusual situation allows for a creative array of episodes in the first few seasons  it is obvious that the actors  and directors  are still getting used to the characters they are trying to create  as such  the first season or two is a little chaotic  though there are underlying personal and situational themes  regardless  the early season are most definitely enjoyable  and provide a good foundation for the seasons that follow once the show gets underway  however  the characters are given more shape and depth  and the acting directing vastly improves  the shows focus on a variety of subjects   interpersonal relationships among the crew  individual moral and spiritual issues  scientific anomalies  and time travel  as well as many other things  both new and previously used aliens appear in the series  so while there are unfamiliar species  such as the kazon   there are also ties to the original star trek villains i highly recommend seasons two and four   they stand out as two of the best star trek  voyager  with its unique cast of characters and unusual mission  is a new way to explore the  final frontier   I have been a fan of the star trek series since star trek the next generation  i used to watch the next gen after school and i loved the idea of going off to space to explore new worlds and meeting new peoples  but the one thing that bothered me about the series was all the constrictions that the enterprise had to go through  there was several shows that had the federation saying  you cannot do this  or that   but with star trek voyager you have a smaller ship with only a couple of dozen of people on board in a distant part of the galaxy who are trying to get home  far away from their family  friends and superiors  the series does an great job at redefining several species and introduces new ones  the cast is great and is always fun to watch robert picardo as the doctor because he gets me laughing all the time  the ship has plenty of interesting characters all growing throughout the series  the doctor becomes more then just a hologram medical helper and becomes a real member of the ship  captain janeway becomes a strong confident captain  tom paris  a womanizing troublemaker buckles down with a former hot head  federation hating klingon  so if you love space exploration then this is the series for you  i was not really a big fan of star trek until i saw voyager accidentally one time on cable  i forgot which particular episode but it was so creative and funny  that i kicked myself for not noticing this treasure  thanks to the advent of netflix and post   video technology distribution  i am able to embark into every episodes for the entire   seasons  what about the doctor   emergency medical hologram to emergency command hologram  robert picardo made me love the show so much  what a joy to just see him perform and struggle with his  humanity   he makes me laugh out loud so many times  i had to apologize to my roommate for my uncontrollable outburst  voyager is my painkiller for breaking out the laughs  it has   it is just so funny sometimes  i cannot help it  my wife and i love  jeri ryan  seven  and robert picardo  emh  duet     you are my sunshine   their voices so pure  i still hear it in my head  it might be corny to some but voyager is making a grand statement    to express as humanly possible    the purest form of unrelentless expression of art    without restraint    of music  dreams and holo novels  etc  i have to say  voyager is a very entertaining series  there are immense creativity into the moral conscience  and interpersonal development within each member of the crew  instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky  writers of voyager gave picardo the freedom to express beyond anything you can imagined  he is more feeling and more emotional than most organics    and boy  can he sing  i love the premise for doctor s expansive  self growth  developing  and becoming a valuable member as part of  the family  decision in the final   episodes of endgame  science fiction at its best  toward the end  emh actually disobey captain s order and make  human  mistakes  i believe the chemistry between the crew works well  harry kim and tom paris  neelix and tuvok     those two are actually quite funny  i love tuvoc occasional humor  despite being a vulcan  finally  I am so glad they did not go with the original actress for janeway   have you seen the rare   episode footage      thank god for kate mulgrew  she has developed through the   years into an extremely confid',\n",
       "  'ent  believable  and respectable female captain  let me put it this way  kate mulgrew did more than i ever envision a female captain could do    even with a hint of feminine quality  hard to believe but the chemistry balance was just right  kate  what a great job  thank you star trek for making voyager  i enjoy every episode  the creativity  of morals issues we face everyday  and the potential possibilities of our cosmic expanse  voyager started off on shaky ground  but gradually levelled off into a good scifi show  it took tng forever to find its unique niche and identity  and so it is for voyager  it can be compared to the original star trek  in its go where no one has gone before identity humor and drama  action and sometimes even horror are well balanced in voyager  the characters started off slightly odd but eventually became edgy but fast friends with each other  even neelix  the talaxian who often looks as if he has   he is wearing rejects from quark s wardrobe  has become a far more palatable and even likable character if neelix can make me laugh  then voyager has its niche     this is yet another brilliant star trek series  this time the danger  fraught adventures of the federation star ship voyager  as a result of  the caretaker s intervention  voyager has been stranded in the  generally hostile delta quadrant    years travel from earth  with  little prospect of any return home in the foreseeable future and  initially not even any communication with the distant federation  the  voyager crew consists of some likewise stranded maquis  including  chakotay   b elanna  who have been forced to join forces with the  original federation crew in a mutual struggle to survive and return  safely to the alpha quadrant   commanding voyager is surely the federation s most bold  determined   decisive  and feisty captain  kathryn janeway is a no nonsense lady  who  given the risks inherent in this unexplored new quadrant  is  frequently obligated to arm the photon torpedoes first and seek  diplomacy later  her stern voice commands  hail them   when hostile  species threaten  generally followed by the even more terse and severe  call   battlestations   captain janeway  who is addicted to black  coffee  has left a fiancé back home on earth   the delta quadrant really is not a very friendly place  one of the first  adversaries encountered is the kazon  a brutal race subdivided into  constantly warring factions  the vidians have an unfortunate tendency  to steal organs from living victims in their attempts to counteract the  phage  which has plagued their people for centuries  the malon are the  quadrant s polluters  dumping their garbage of deadly theta radiation  wherever they can get away with doing so  the hirogen are obsessed with  the hunt  the pursuit of prey  the kill  and the collection of  trophies  species   hails from fluidic space and boasts five  genders  most deadly is the ongoing threat of the ubiquitous borg with  their cubes  spheres  nasty queen  and disquieting desire for  assimilation   janeway s calm  likable first officer  chakotay  is a former maquis of  native american origin  he has a tendency to navel gaze about his  ancestors  spiritual beliefs  he   janeway share a truly touching bond  of mutual respect  friendship  and dependency  unhindered by the threat  of romance    except once when stranded perhaps indefinitely alone  together on a planet  when some sparks fly between them    harry kim is the innocent young operations officer  everyone s  favourite boy next door  homesick for his parents and unlucky in love   the ship s ongoing romance is between tom paris and b elanna torres   b elanna is the feisty  hot tempered  half klingon chief engineer  tom  is voyager s cool  nonchalant  charming pilot   helmsman  who has a yen  for old movies  captain proton  rock   roll  fast cars and even faster  spacecraft  midway through the series he designs a fancy new shuttle  craft  the delta flyer   tuvok and neelix are polar opposites  tuvok  the totally logical   openly emotionless vulcan tactical officer  has left a wife   family  back home on vulcan  needless to say  he experiences a pon farr during  voyager s travels  tuvok s leisure pursuits include meditating  playing  logic games such as kal toh  and listening to vulcan dirges  neelix is  the super friendly  warm hearted  enthusiastic cook and morale officer   a talaxian who has lost his family as a result of a devastating weapon   the metreon cascade  on his home planet  tuvok appears to barely  tolerate neelix  but underneath is a touching  unacknowledged  affection  one of the more intriguing episodes sees a transporter  glitch combine tuvok   neelix into one individual  tuvix  with a truly  unique personality mixture of the two   in my opinion  the only uninteresting crew member is neelix s  girlfriend  the lovely kess  despite her developing special powers   kess is an ocampan  a delta quadrant race with a short life span  whose  females incubate their young in a sac on their back  kess is replaced  mid way through the series by the totally compelling and endearing  seven of nine  a borg of human origin  severed from the collective  during the fascinating two part episode  the scorpion  the beautiful  blonde seven struggles to adjust to her newfound individuality as she  punches up data in astrometrics  ever efficient in her skin tight garb  and pausing only long enough to regenerate    perhaps the most lovable crew member is the doctor  actually the  emergency medical hologram  but with more personality than any of the  organic folk  he has   he is a totally insufferable  arrogant  yet very appealing  character who has a brief love affair of his own with a vidian doctor   he also sings opera and has something of a crush on seven  to whom he  gives dating lessons  definitely voyager s funniest episode   there has   there is  even a child aboard  the charming little half ktarian naomi wildman   who was born on voyager  neelix reads her bedtime stories  but later  she longs to become captain s assistant  her role model is seven with  whom she plays kadiscat    new technologies introduced in the series include voyager s bio neural  gel packs  needless to say  the crew frequently encounter false leads  that promise a quick trip home to the alpha quadrant  a number of their  adventures involve disruptions in the time line  the most compelling  time related episode is the two part year of hell  involving constant  attacks by the krenim time ship with its devastating temporal weapon   at the heart of the series is the crew s camaraderie in its assorted  struggles to return to the alpha quadrant  their goal is challenging   but it has   it is the journey that counts  my sole complaint is the show s  occasional intrusion into the theological realm with the klingon  messiah  klingon hell etc  otherwise  it has   it is a wonderful   unique science  fiction series with a stellar cast  finally  my compliments to the late  jerry goldsmith for his amazing theme music  i call it the music of  longing to go home  as was true with star trek deep space nine  as the star trek voyager series progresses  the episodes keep getting better and better   seven of nine s quest to regain her humanity  and the doctor s similar  voyage   although he has   he is not technically human  are captivating as their characters continue to develop over the course of the series  their relationship is also a tantalizing aspect of the series  I am half way through season   now  and to date  i find  someone to watch over me   season    episode    to be the best episode of the series to date  this episode also includes some of the funniest lines in any star trek  ever  i know it has   it is been over   years since this series first aired  but i wish to offer my sincerest congratulations to the writers and creators of this wonderful series  voyager is the best star trek series yet  hands down  while that may be an opinionated statement  i reason this by pointing out several key parts of the show which make it more enjoyable than any other series  the cast  firstly  has a lot of diversity and characters such as janeway  seven of nine and the doctor are extremely engaging throughout their respective seasons  the concept of the ship being stranded thousands of light years away from earth or federation space is not simply an interesting basis in its own right  but betters the development of these characters  they are isolated in an unknown region of space with foreign enemies and perils  which forces the characters to grow and adapt  it creates a new level of camaraderie as the voyager crew depend on their ingenuity  co operation and resourcefulness to find a way home while these new aliens and planets may seem off putting to both newcomers and old fans of star trek  the show is grounded nicely by the federation principles which voyager upholds  their journey home is seen also as a mission of exploration  and familiar issues  such as the classic moral dilemma or prime directive story  return in different circumstances  however well the writers stick to the tried and tested formula  which is not a bad thing   a whole new quadrant of the milky way allows plenty of scope  as mentioned  for new enemies  while the kazon are quite possibly the least intriguing of these  the disease decimated vidiians  hunting driven hirogen  unmatchable species   etc are all fascinating  romulans  cardassians  ferengi etc make  cameos  too  while the borg encounters have made captain janeway the stuff of legend the main reason to watch voyager is that it is enjoyable  just like most star trek and like all tv aims to be  it has the real feeling of exploration  revamped and revitalised from the older programmes  the real star trek atmosphere is caught up in the lonely but determined ship stuck in the delta quadrant  sticking to their guns through thick and thin  voyager     seasons on dvd  this is a must see  backgrounds  stories  characters  are all first class  an excellent work of modern tv drama  following entirely the gene roddenberry s vision  this show is indeed a prime derivative  it would be unfair to mention any name in particular  the integration of roles  stories and dialog is remarkable  if you ever liked a sci fi film then these dvd boxes contain a treasure  from very important social issues  through galactic perils and humor  the crew of voyager along with its creative team will take you really where no man has gone before  packaging is robust and typical  all seasons contain extra material  audio and video take a   in    enjoy the ride in the   quadrant  this is an order  voyager is over  at least for now   we all know that no one really dies  or in this case ends  in the star trek universe  it has been a fun   years  voyager as been an oasis in a wasteland of television   it has provided the watcher adventure  romance  comedy  drama and social awareness   there have been a few disappointing episodes  but that is true with almost every show  on the whole  i think that voyager has lived up to the star trek name and furthered mr  roddenberry s dreams   I shall   I will miss voyager and her crew   but i would like to thank the  powers that be  for a happy ending  to me  nothing can approach the goofy  paper mache rock flinging greatness of the original series  voyager  however  is a close second due to the ever evolving character relationships and story lines that center around entire  fascinating  command staff rather than being  the starfleet captain show  or occasional focus on one or two main characters  speaking of captain janeway  i simply cannot understand how a few consider the character or the actress  weak   st series best to worst imo  star trek  voyager  star trek tng  enterprise  star trek tas  disappointment   voyager can be said to be a science fiction version of homer s story of the odyssey with captain janeway as a female version of odysseus  the crew of voyager face the same adventures that odysseus and his crew did after the trojan war  many of the episodes reflect the myths of the of the odyssey especially the one where the planet of women that capture men to drain them of life such as ceres did to the crew in the novel  much like other star trek series  each episode is more or less self contained  in that it has little to no effect on future episodes as they are exploring other worlds or space phenomenon  but there is one constant  they are trying to get home  as good as the original series or next generation were  they never had any underlying story',\n",
       "  'line as voyager does i like the point of choosing voyager for the journey  it has   it is a ship that can just about manage the long distance at a good speed  other lesser space craft in the star trek universe would be too slow making thier journey seem unrealistic and virtually unattainable  and the brilliant crew work well together but the best part of voyager is that it shows that star trek is not just enterprise  we have done three series  with enterprise as the major space craft so it has   it is nice to see them move on  i recognise that deep space nine had the namesake space station and the small craft intrepid  and now there has   there is discovery with its namesake craft i enjoyed every episode of voyager and though the storyline was well made  especially in the latter  seven of nine  seasons with the borg  i have a particularly strong attachment to this show and can honestly say it is my favorite in the whole star trek universe  i started to watch it from day one all the way to the end even though it took a while for the series to fully realize its potential  the first   seasons were good but nowhere near as great as the show would become later yet i hung on  hopeful that something better would come along and then boom  seven of nine appeared the show only started to become really wonderful when jeri ryan was added to the show with scorpions at the end of the   season as the cliffhanger for season    somehow  i really connected with this particular character and from then on  they could do no wrong or at least  they could always count on my loyalty to watch  sure the writing is uneven in places and some episodes are not as great as others but it has   it is true for any series i have to say that the number one reason why i connected so strongly with this series is this particular set of characters  somehow  it all gelled so well and even though i have favorites of course like seven  the doctor and janeway  they all had something interesting to add to the mix and the chemistry always worked for me  even in sub par episodes  but thankfully  even the lowest rated episodes have something interesting to offer i was particularly satisfied with how the series ended  the perfect conclusion to one heck of a journey and i still miss it to this day even though i can always watch to my heart s content any time i feel like it  this is connected with a great time in my life and i will always remember if fondly a strong   stars is well deserved and the   star is deducted from the perfect score only because the writing is sometimes not as strong as it should be  especially with episodes not connected to the borg or seven of nine  but still  every single show has something to offer and this series remain one of the very best i had the pleasure of experiencing as it ran for   successful seasons and i could not recommend it enough  ok  the last season was a disappointment  no arguments here  up until that point however  this was a pretty darn good show  season four was my personal favorite  with episodes like nemesis  year of hell and living witness   the revisionist history point could have been used again who could not like this show  it was episodes like those that made this show true  poignant star trek  get the season four dvd  it is awesome as has the most of the most skillfully crafted written  directed  acted  shot  episodes of this show or   for the first two years  they could not seem to get the marquis thing out of their  the writers  head s  but for the most part this was ok  the episode where paris  little act was revealed and alliances more that made up for learning curve  tuvoks boot camp  and parallax where torres first became chief engineer  which actually was a necessarily rough episode  being the first one after the premiere  the characters developed gradually over time but each of them developed steadily and at their own pace  even tuvok  who at first was so terribly stolid stoic things actually started to wane plot wise around the   season  most were still watchable but they lacked drive and intensity  muse  fury and blink of an eye  was that a   season   were pretty great though  who determined that every star trek set in this century needed   seasons anyway  that is how disappointing season   feels to many people  it never should have happened  i cannot believe  or can hardly believe  what they did to some of the main characters during that season   thinking mainly of author author like episodes here   but everyone had ample amounts of episodes in the spotlight and most had ample time in episodes that were focused on others  here is what set voyager apart everyone got significant time on screen well  that has   that is about it  save that janeway did at times seem bi polar and the whole thing about getting home  the restart button   got pretty old eventually  that has   that is one thing that set timeless apart  time travel  good kim episode  voyager did not get home but ended up getting closer to home  the show had many individual episodes on all points on the rating scale  over all    out of   points star trek  voyager is a great series to watch  the initial concept of the show is pretty simple  uss voyager is taken to the delta quadrant against there will and are stranded there   leaving them no choice to but to embark on a long and dangerous journey home the voyager series brings in a lot of new and old ideas about the star trek universe  the new idea of having a holographic doctor and being able to send him on away missions is a very complex and entertaining idea  the idea of two opposing factions banding together to work as one crew is new  however  some old ideas do still remain for example the unattractive uniforms  color designations  button sounds and the weakness of their ship the cast is full of good actors  at first the characters were green and so was the acting  but by the second season the characters and acting seemed to flow much better  captain jane way certainly looks and feels like a leader and her choices are often made by seeking advice from other crew members  but some of her decisions are startlingly dark and immoral  there were a lot of recurring minor roles for actors and they brought a unique feel to the show one of the best things i like about this series is that it gets very technical  but is also dumbed down enough to make sure the ordinary lay man  like myself  can still understand what has   what is going on  the addition of seven of nine was a great idea  jeri ryan brought in a great sex appeal and added further to the technical stand points in the show  i fully enjoyed learning a lot about the borg  it is one of the species i was most interested in if you want to know about the borg  this is the series to watch  also  this series is very dark  at some points i had shed some tears  rick berman was shooting for a darker star trek and he made it happen the points of the show i did not like was that the ship always seems to have some sort of problem and that shields and weapons are almost always offline or not working  it also seemed like the crew was not trained well enough for combat fighting  after a while it appears as if all combat is turn based   if you do not know what i mean think of it this way  one person fires and then the enemy fires and continues back and forth   by the end of the show itself the writing formats seemed to be predictable  after season    each episode seemed to start ending abruptly  within the last   minutes it seems that everything episode or problems gets solved and life goes back to normal without any residual effects  after watching full seasons with that kind of writing  the show starts to get a little tiresome overall  this is a wonderful show  it outlines betrayal  morality  trust  honor and integrity  each episode takes you on journey to learning a new life lesson  i have been watching the star trek shows from tng to enterprise and having just finished voyager i must say i really do love this series  i grew up with tng so it will always be      plus picard nuff said  voyager offers a show that has   that is just as good  with a great cast and awesome show dynamics  i do think voyager should have acquired some better technology from the delta quadrant  endgame shows voyager as a wicked starship with borg inspired weapons and armour but that has   that is it one episode of really good quality new weaponry  i find also the technical aspect of the show was far better than tng   and enterprise  they explained things in more detail and ran into truly interesting space oddities coupled with better cg representations  which is the reason i hate tos so much  I am not from that time so i really find the visuals and special effects lame and boring  voyager has the strange distinction of being the first trek series that i did not like  to me there has   there is a throughline of complexity that runs from tos to   and then just stops at voyager  an intriguing premise is spoiled early on with pretty much all the maquis conflict resolved within   episodes  the  unfamiliar  delta quadrant ends up being populated with species that are largely derivative of other races already seen lacking imagination the writers sought to shoehorn as much of tng s cast offs into the show as possible  lieutenant barclay  troi  and how could we forget the borg  one of the biggest mistakes the show made was to return to the borg well too often  every time we learned something new about the collective their power and presence was compromised  how many times can a poorly equipped science vessel defeat them before all menace is removed  voyager lacked originality and never strove to bring anything different to the franchise  the characters lacked any real sparkle and the episodic nature of the show ended up making a number of characters look schizophrenic  especially janeway  who see sawed in her behaviour depending on what the episode called for  this was further compounded by kate mulgrew whose goose like voice  overexpressively constipated facial expressions and robotic body movements made watching a disbelieving experience the biggest downfall of the show was that the solution to everything seemed to be technology  especially borg for the last few seasons  the solution to problems being the pressing of buttons did not make for high drama voyager had the occasional excellent episode  usually the   parters  and it did have some good actors amongst the cast  though the parts they played rarely gave them the opportunity to display this voyager is regarded as the beginning of the end of trek  being less popular than its predecessors and less well regarded critically than what had come before  voyager  like enterprise  failed to keep pace with the wider changing tv environment to which shows like   and babylon   were early adopters  and maybe even trend setters   there would be no programmes like   or lost without shows like these   it is not so much a bad show as  bad by comparison   great show   almost  the best start to finish show of all time  but it has some slow patches in early seasons before it becomes really awesome and like buffy the vampire slayer and gives each season a clear beginning end and unique concept to a story line and really starts cooking  one of the best finales to a show  and a perfect wrap up that none of the other star trek shows  or many shows  have ever achieved to date  perhaps the last of the sci fi series saga that portrays future in glorious light and not try to bring future down to  man  size like so many of the sci fi series that came since then  including star trek s own  enterprise  series   the characters  the special effects  the production design are of highest creativity and beauty  something epitome of sci fi has strived for since first sci fi appeared on screen I am not sure why sci fi characters started getting merged with working class heroes in recent years  but this only shrinks the genre in my opinion  if this series was the swan song for the beautiful portrayal of our future  i think the loss is great as a die hard sci fi fan  this series was the last of the great sci fi epic  if you see that the subsequent series  enterprise  became the first star trek series to be canceled due to poor ratings  i believe that there is still a market for great sci fi epic like the star trek voyager in my opinion this was the best of star trek series with best production design  and character portrayal  i would love to see more star trek series continue in this vein and i hope other sci fi series will follow su'],\n",
       " ['we knew already that mel gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision and the craftsmanship to go with it  extraordinary battle scenes  violence  gibson style  which means peckinpah plus  because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame  utterly compelling  the only drawback and i have to say it  vince vaughn  why  in the moment he appears  this extraordinary film becomes a movie  it took me completely out of it  when you look at him you see an actor  acting  on the other hand  andrew garfield  sublime  he makes totally believable a character that could be fictional  the humanity in andrew garfield s eyes makes everything real  it tells us  in no uncertain terms  that at the very center of it all  there is love  love  as someone from sydney  australia i was proud at the way this was filmed  using the hollywood model  there would have been lots of sets but using actual buildings allowed a lot of warmth to come through in the natural light  gibson is a fine director  i was impressed with his framing  he shoots very closely for the acting stuff  more head and shoulder  which is quite interesting on the eye  using more natural light it is quite beautiful  i suspect gibson will not yet have been forgiven for his personal life to get the recognition he deserves this movie could have been another forest gump  it could overly sentimental  instead  carries an appropriate amount of sincerity  the backstory is a major part of the movie  doss is portrayed as uneasy with the girls who fell for the first pretty thing he saw  this could have been so forest gump like but strikes a nice chord the cast was excellent  hugo weaving was perfection  he carried the first half of the movie as the battle fatigued  ptsd    vet father  some may complain that the women are poorly portrayed as are the japanese  who are largely like ants coming from their mound or canon fodder as brutal as the second half is  i am sure it could not convey how truly gallant doss was or brutal it was in reality  when thinking about war films  it has   it is very hard not to go straight to the classics such as apocalypse now  platoon or saving private ryan  you have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in hacksaw ridge  i think mel gibson has made one of the all time great war films some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story  all three of the above for example however  a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story  especially one as remarkable as the story that hacksaw ridge is based on desmond t  doss  andrew garfield  became the first conscientious objector in american history to be awarded the medal of honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the battle of okinawa in world war ii  doss  phenomenal story of courage saw him single handedly save the lives of over   of his comrades while under constant enemy fire hacksaw ridge is very much a film of two halves  the first introducing us to doss  exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a conscientious objector and serve as a medic  the second depicting the battle of okinawa at hacksaw ridge  the site of one of the bravest human feats in history  both tell the story of the determined individual that doss was and mel gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director  and in hacksaw ridge  he may just have made his best film yet  it has   it is the emotional power of the story that gibson taps into so successfully that makes hacksaw ridge such compelling viewing  whether it be doss  arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences  i was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll speaking of war sequences  hacksaw ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you shall   you will ever see  reminiscent of the opening to saving private ryan  due to the fact that doss served as a medic  there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers  the relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from gibson and they are wonderfully shot by simon duggan coming to the performances  hacksaw ridge features an amazing lead performance from andrew garfield  who wanted to move away from his days as spider man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero  i thought garfield was always one of the best things about the amazing spider man films but it has   it is great to see him really grow as an actor  his performance as doss is one of the best of the year and i would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season the supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film  expected from the likes of hugo weaving and teresa palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were  sam worthington and luke bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was vince vaughn  who i never thought I had   I would see play a part in a war film  particularly that of an army sergeant few films this year have hit me emotionally as hacksaw ridge did and that has   that is why i have to say it has   it is a most welcome return to filmmaking from mel gibson  it has   it is right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen  i was lucky enough to sneak into a cast   crew screening at the newtown dendy cinema  i thought     on a sunday was too early for a mel gibson movie  that i might be in for something along the lines of the heavy handedness of the passion of the christ  and the adrenaline pumped brilliance of apocalypto i was proved wrong because after the first thirty minutes i was not sure if this was a mel gibson film when i was placed into a comfort zone  with its melodrama set in a small virginia town during the forties  a schmaltzy romance  and the cliché violent drunken father who survived a brutal war  the performances were maybe a little let down by the clumsy dialogue  but all directed safely with a natural sense of storytelling by the   act  i was put on high alert in the military training with our protagonist  desmond doss  andrew garfield who i at first felt was wrongly cast  but he really came through in the end   it was here when the true purpose of the story began to evolve  that of doss  moral and internal conflict with using a gun  what he had to endure and stand up for was a courage i greatly admired  it was also in this phase of the film that the dialogue and characters began to shine  maybe it was the introduction of vince vaughn s character  we all know how vaughn is notorious in ad libbing  and it seemed to help because the other actors bounced off it well now the story had me in their pocket because by the   act i was with our protagonist and his platoon when they got to the battlefield graveyard of hacksaw ridge  you thought the horrific situation in we were soldiers was brutal  well this was captured so vividly that you felt you were there  it was almost on par with the brilliance of game of thrones  battle of the bastards now i felt i was in a mel gibson film  as with braveheart  the battle scenes in hacksaw ridge did not hold back  maybe a notch better because of today s cgi  and i did not even notice the effects    the scenes were unflinching  haunting and in your face  possibly showing you the true horror of war  definitely not for the squeamish the religious aspect of the film was relevant to the story  so as a non believer i thought it was an integral part of the protagonist and had to be told  so it did not bother me as much overall the technical aspect of the film was brilliant  but then again i did not really notice it because i was too distracted by the story and the characters  and when that occurs  i know the film has succeeded  just watched this movie at the pre screening and feel like i owe it to the creators to write a review  having read other reviews  it is hard to stay original  so first are few thoughts that i shared with the others  great to have mel gibson back in the directors seat  i will be surprised if we do not see this film in a few oscars categories  now  few thoughts of my own  the movie depicts brutality of war in gory details  so much so  that i had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times  however  i do understand why this was important to the story line  it was done so that we could truly appreciate doss s act of bravery  feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand   nothing was left out  the story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end   after the movie i turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears  bottom line   instant classic that will find it has   it is place on the shelf next to the likes of saving private ryan and band of brothers  hacksaw ridge is not a film for the feint hearted  right away the opening scenes portray the horror of war  and the emotional journey is only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war hero desmond doss  one of the great feats of storytelling from mel gibson  director  and andrew garfield  leading role  desmond doss  is to lead the audience along doss  journey with a feeling of having experienced the journey as doss  and experiencing the wide range of emotions endured by this heroic character along his journey neither war itself nor violence are glorified in the film  yet they also not derided  the elements of conflict that draw the storyteller – the heroism of overcoming adversity  the bonding of soldiers  and the brave resolve on which soldiers must rely to perform their duty amidst such chaos and terror – these elements are all present  but they placed alongside the horror  the madness and the terror of war  and used to draw in the audience for doss  journey  the lasting psychological impact for those who survive conflict is well told by hugo weaving s portrayal of doss  father  whose lines could serve as a mouthpiece for many veterans the supporting roles add depth  with both script and performance making very few  if any  of the supporting characters two dimensional  vince vaughn s excellent turn as doss  training sergeant provides both humour and pathos to bring laughs and pause  for thought at well scripted points of the tale  allowing the audience to gather their breath by the end of the film  audience members will leave the cinema feeling tired  worn out by having experienced doss  journey of hope  innocence  love  confusion  anger  faith  and courage  hacksaw ridge is in no way a popcorn lazy sunday afternoon film  it is a journey  with its late release over here in england  by the time the film was released  it had already come to prominence with overwhelming reviews and   oscar nominations to its name  so i entered with relatively high expectations  which i generally find to be a bad call as you tend to be let down  however gibson s first directorial effort in a decade   hacksaw ridge   is a raw and emotional gut punch with the history of cinema being littered with the production of world war ii films  primarily in the form of over the top propaganda pictures such as  saving private ryan   which nonetheless i still love   it has   it is nice to see a movie that delves down the path of anti  war and focuses on the true life tale of an uncaped superhero over fictional splendour  and  hacksaw ridge  is just that  the film starts with rather over sentimental  soap opera style tendencies which are occasionally funny to watch  but nonetheless they are perfect at delivering character development to our front running hero desmond doss  i was initially expecting a  pearl harbor  approach  with over an hour of lovey dovey sentimental crap followed by under accomplished action  but it was quite the opposite  the opening features the stated character development drama  but gives us an insight into doss s personal reasons for his faith and religious approaches  then thrusts us into war now  the war scenes    well  let us just say they are some scenes i doubt I shall   I will be forgetting anytime soon  they are epic  they are visceral  they are emotional  they are gory  but above all else  they are executed perfectly  upon reaching the top of the maeda escarpment  nicknamed  hacksaw ridge   the squad are instantly driven into the horrors of war  the loss of friends and hope  the raw and visceral images are maybe even a little too realistic  dead bodies are strewn across the ground  innards and entrails litter the floor  smoke and fire choke the landscape  this is war  hacksaw ridge  is a hard hitting film that if watched and truly understood  will be an unforgettable experience  and the concluding interviews with the real life doss add to the emotional core  the cinematography is stunning  the music is beautifully alluring and the performances  especially from andrew garfield  are beyond fantastic  garfield completely embodies the persona of doss with sheer accuracy  further shoutouts to hugo weaving  sam worthington and the surprisingly brilliant vince vaughn  this is  in my opinion  one of the greatest films to have graced      or   here in the uk  we forgive you gibson  hacksaw ridge is the latest film from the infamous mel gibson and it is as electrifying as one would come to expect  telling the story of desmond doss  an army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in okinawa at the height of world war ii  the untold story of doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell  starring andrew garfield  vince vaughn  sam worthington and teresa palmer  hacksaw ridge is a beautifully acted and viciously portrayed war film that will stick with you from the minute the film starts until the second the end credits start  it will leave you clawing your seat  wiping away the sweat from your palms as we see garfield s doss save as many lives as he possibly can while dodging bullets and hand grenades  the film starts in the most somber of times in american history  the second world war  desmond doss  the son of a ptsd riddled alcoholic army man  hugo weaving  who served in world war i  is also as much as a devout christian as he is a patriot  leading him to join the fight against the oppressive japanese military  doss is in love with a small town girl dorothy schutte  teresa palmer  who is scared that she shall   she will never see doss again  especially after the persecution he is sure to face  when in training camp  doss refuses to touch a gun and is actually court marshaled for his refusal  this leads to a trial in which he is allowed by his superior officers to go into okinawa with no fire arm to protect him  much of the film is steeped in realism  something that mel gibson specializes in when it comes to violence  while the story and plot line may sound very traditional  the way it is portrayed is a fresh burst of life into a tired genre such as this  that  coupled with the amazing true life story of desmond doss being portrayed on screen  makes hacksaw ridge a wild and brutal trip down the path to christianity and the power that faith can give a man  gibson  a devout catholic himself  would be the director to bring this story to life  his religious views seep through his very being  especially through his films and this film is no exception  the film settles in the idea that god is literally protecting doss  not only physically but spiritually as well  doss is constantly tested throughout the film  almost needing to take a life  which is the ultimate sin to him  in many scenes  the fact that this man did not fire a single round and saved as many men as he did is astounding and the film really does an amazing job at showing the harsh realities of war but also showing the good that can be brought out in a man through his faith  the film itself  is one of gibson s less preachy works which makes it more accessible  even if faith based films are not your thing  you can appreciate the craft that went into making this film  hacksaw ridge displays war as atrocious as it truly is  there is blood  there is gore and there are a couple wounds that will cut even the strongest of men down  this is an extremely violent film but it is extremely violent in the sense that there is enough going on around us to never make us truly settle in the violence which would take away a lot of the impact that gibson is trying to portray  the film is paced very nicely and does feel more like a traditional war film without it really being the traditional world war ii film  the filmmaking is traditional but the story is unique and is definitely the driving force to run out and see this film  the performance from andrew garfield is amazing  he sheds any sort of preconceived notion and really embodies the roll of doss quite well  he is far from a revelation but he is on the right track in delivering a very fine performance  the screenplay is tight and taught  like i said  there are scenes that are heart pounding in this film  personally  i found myself holding my breath during some of the action sequences  it was that intense at parts  while i do have great things to say about this film  i will say  i was a bit disappointed in the performances all around  while i thought garfield did an amazing job carrying a film that was not spider man  i wish he was a little better  i felt the same way with the rest of the cast  the melodrama that is portrayed very early on in the film is something that does begin to corrode the realist efforts of everything else  however  once the action starts  so does the really great acting on everyone s parts  gibson is an actor that revels in the moments of pure chaos and he expects the same thing from his actors  it makes for some intense scenes that are elevated by the pure realism that the actors portray  you actually feel as though you are watching these people go to war  it is a testament to mel gibson as a director  he really knows how to put you in the moment and hacksaw ridge just solidifies his talent  overall  i felt hacksaw ridge was an extremely brutal and visceral war film that brings up questions of warfare  humanity and religion while displaying gibson s excellent eye for technical accuracy and assaulting imagery  say what you will about gibson as a person but as a director he is sharp  gritty and a master at what he does  good war films can be very disturbing to watch  the dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find hacksaw ridge     one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema  if it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism the film plays in two halves  the early life and romance of army medic desmond doss  andrew garfield  and the actual battle of hacksaw ridge  raised in bible best virginia  doss had a troubled upbringing under an abusive father  a devout seventh day adventist  he swore never to commit violence or even carry a weapon but felt duty bound to enlist in the army  not long after meeting the one love of his life  nurse dorothy schutte  teresa palmer   he enlisted with the belief that he could serve his god unarmed and without killing enemy soldiers branded a coward and bullied to leave  he was eventually granted conscientious objector status and became one of the troops sent to capture hacksaw ridge in the battle of okinawa of may    while the assault was forced to retreat under overwhelming enemy fire  doss remained behind and single handedly evacuated   casualties  lowering them by rope from an escarpment over   metres high  the ridge was eventually captured and doss became one of the most decorated heroes of world war ii the heroism depicted in this story is of such an extraordinary magnitude that it can easily overwhelm any consideration of the film s merits  with an uncomplicated and factual narrative arc  the story rests on two pillars  acting and filming  on both scores  this film deserves high praise  while the early life and romance chapt',\n",
       "  'er drifts towards melodrama  garfield is cast to perfection as the wide eyed and straight talking man of unshakeable principle and palmer convincingly plays his adorable emotional anchor  together with a strong support cast that includes several big name stars  this is a powerful ensemble that carries the story convincingly the most outstanding element of this film  however  is its powerhouse hyper realistic cinematography and spectacular set constructions that relentlessly convey the brutality of war  while it is an outstanding technical production  giving spectacle precedence over narrative is the film s achilles heel  one or maybe a few helmeted heads shredded or bodies bayonetted can convey much  but twenty deadens the senses  if ever there was a case where less could have been more  this is it  otherwise this is a gripping film with forceful storytelling about a remarkable war hero  i was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of hacksaw ridge in hollywood and was impressed  the screenplay is authentically driven to the last detail and portrays the horrors  and prejudices  of wartime conduct  i knew we were watching an epic film when at the conclusion  the audience was stunned so much so that the applause was delayed if you consider yourself a true patriot of america  this movie portrays your values in a blessed light  for one gentlemen  amidst extremely adverse treatment by his own comrades and even more deadly hated by his enemy to have save so many men    is simply epic i watched the advanced screening with members of the military and faith community alike  at no time did anyone retract from the horrors of war or add asinine political commentary  we all understood that soldiers fight for one another before they fight for a cause and that hatred of war is universal  even among soldiers  war films can be a bit hard to sit through  with its graphic depictions of key battles in history  strong themes of power  brotherhood and the effect it has among the world but with mel gibson s latest war drama  hacksaw ridge  it manages to be something more that we can grasp it the true life story of desmond doss is finally brought to the big screen  doss was a us army medic who served during wwii  but coming from a family with a strong religious beliefs and a father that struggled with the aftermath of wwi  a veteran himself  it lead him to be a seventh day adventist  refusing to bare a firearm and the use of violence against another  his personal choice would affect his country s army and persuaded a court hearing to charge doss for his personal beliefs and objection to bare arms but despite this  he is given the chance though to fight alongside his  brothers  in the battle of okinawa  a battle which the american forces fought against the invading japanese in an intense and brutal battle  it is here in this key battle that doss was recognised as a true hero for his country  as he managed to rescue the lives of   soldiers wounded in battle gibson returns to the director s chair to helm this true story  giving his touch of humanistic quality  anti war themes and brutality to the horrors of war to much great detail  the direction is pretty much on point throughout and never goes dull or loses itself during the   ½ running time  the first half of the film is about character and what establishes doss to become a legend that he is known for  while the   half of the film focuses on his role during the battle of okinawa and the brutal battle itself  the violence here is given so much detail  not holding back on the horrors of war and the devastating effect it carried on both sides  the production design  sound mixing  editing and scale of the battle is as intense  horrifying and respectful to the details and real life experiences to what we have read in history books  but it is yet filmed with beautiful and yet brutal detailing that echoes much to saving private ryan s d day battle sequence  the   half of the film is much darker than the first half and people will need a strong stomach to handle the graphic depictions of violence and deaths we see throughout  but it does get emotional at times and in the last few minutes of the film  though overall the film is emotional with doss s back story  his personal lifestyle and the brotherhood that doss and his army experience and share on the battlefield in terms of acting  the cast as a whole is incredible with andrew garfield  hugo weaving  vince vaughn  luke bracey and teresa palmer giving the best key performances of the film  garfield has come a long way to prove himself as a worthy actor  breaking away from his well known role as spider man prior to hr  to describe his role as doss  he gives a quality that defines him as a simple man with values in his life while facing a few struggles that form his belief of not bearing violence or firearms  garfield must have given much study and preparation for the role  as his character s journey from a wise simple man to a hero of his army is given so much heart  emotion and bravery to make the journey of doss so believable overall  hacksaw ridge is a film that will leave audiences in state of emotion that describes the horrors of war  the bravery of doss and his army and a sense of thankfulness to our past ancestors who had lived in a time to fight for freedom and peace when the world was divided  an incredible film that will indeed earn its amount for oscar nominations and wins in    possibly for best picture  director  actor  production design  music score  sound mixing   editing and script  alongside other film awards  a must see film if you have studied history at school  have an interest in history or if you love a solid war film that has   that is true to its core  a masterpiece that will not be forgotten so quickly or never will  we both highly recommend it     autistic reviewers for well over a year now i have been waiting with baited breath to see this movie  i have been a fan of desmond doss from a child  having the privilege of the movie being filmed in my neck of the woods  and even getting to watch some of the scenes being filmed and meeting mel in the process  ever so briefly   escalated my enthusiasm  when you are that pumped and euphoric  you are usually deflated when the moment finally comes\\x85 but not this time although there were a few aspects of the story that were not as accurate as i would have liked  i realize poetic licence is necessary in some ways to give the real essence of the story  and truth can be so much harder to believe then fiction sometimes  mel managed to portray the man doss so very well  some people are worried this is a religious propaganda anti gun movie and i assure you that is not the message of it at all  however there is no getting past the truth of who he was and it is the reason the story is so powerful  he was a man with an unmovable moral compass and it does not matter if you do not point yours in the same direction  you cannot help but respect him for his courage  bravery  and unwavering faith  the movie starts laying the background of the man that will be the hero of hacksaw ridge  it is both witty and endearing  andrew garfield nails the roll as the gentle scarecrow of a man  he is a bit gawky and yet charming  his accent is true to the real desmond  awkward though it is at times  he really draws you into the character and shows you what a fighter he was  non violent but a fighter just the same  it is well explained what personal experiences have lead him to his discussion to not touch a gun hugo weaving masterfully plays desmond s alcoholic dad  battling with his demons from wwi  and rachel griffiths plays his devoted christian mother trying to hold them all together  teresa palmer plays dorothy  a nurse that captures desmond s heart  sometimes cheesy  but then again in reality it would have been  and it is very amusing to watch  teresa s dorothy is a beautiful and charming addition to the movie vince vaughn plays the roll of drill sergeant howell  he adds humour with his name calling  and humiliation of the soldiers  but is a very genuine   just a guy trying to win a war and keep his men alive in the process   kind of guy  luke bracey is a fantastic addition to the cast as private smitty  the more traditional war story soldier true to his reputation mel does not hold back with the battle scenes  the devastation is already extensive and the ground strewn with bits of bodies by the time the   arrives  the shattering reality of war is dizzying and full of impact  moving so quickly you can barely identify the characters in a whirlwind of panic  pain and death  but amidst the chaos  desmond doss s character is revealed to everyone and even his harshest critics realize how wrong they were about him  watching the story change from having the battalion hate him so much that they try to have him imprisoned  to refusing to go on the battlefield without him  is so moving and inspiring it leaves  it has   it is a wonderful life  in the carnage on the hill  getting eaten by maggots along with the dead soldiers desmond sifts through looking for  one more  soul to save  i saw the movie with a number of friends this evening  of the      of us are combat veterans  with a total of   wars between us     vietnam    desert storm and a current war in the middle east veteran   all the non combat veterans thought the battle scenes were  so horribly  so frighteningly realistic   those who have been to war thought they were incredibly cartoon ish the tactical mistakes such as bunching up  not seeking cover  bodies flying through the air  artillery explosions obviously gasoline  all the ridiculous yelling  were all so blatantly wrong  it was the worst depiction of battle we ever saw if the japanese occupied the top of the  ridge  why did not they simply cut down the cargo netting the troops climbed  why did not they throw grenades down on the assembled americans below  how did the cargo netting ever get there is us troops did not already occupy the top of the mountain  vince vaughn was the basic training sergeant  again  best described as cartoon ish  peter sellers as inspector cleuseau would have been more realistic quite frankly  there is nowhere enough space here to tell you how bad this movie really is in reality  battle is hell  in some ways worse than what was shown on the screen  but in terms of realism  this movie is atrocious  i begin my review by saying that i respect the history and the events that took place in   and i have the utmost respect for the guys who gave their life for that cause  having said that  let me tell you my opinion about the movie  and only the movie well  first of all i found it dull and uninteresting  the actors were fake  the scenes looked like rehearsals and uncut material  it was split in two half  the first was about nothing  well you could say stubbornness and stupidity because i was made to fell nothing for the main character except annoyed and uninterested  and the second about guts and gore  did i said the actors looked fake  oh  yeah  but man  oh man that was the main problem for me  the actors looked fake and the entire movie looked like a poorly made joke the plot was something like this  let us establish the motives  good  now the cause    good and now the effects  perfect  now we can move on  the audience got it  and so on and so forth  now lets slip in some romance  you cannot have a movie without romance  good  check  now let us be jerks about it and make his life uncomfortable in the army  check  but hey  he got beliefs  check  one big check list  no emotion  no heart  no nothing  a dead flat feeling let me tell you few spoilers from the movie that i found to be really bad the scene where he meets the guys from the army in the barrack  why in the hell should you put a naked guy  no brains  just muscles  to do pull ups naked  why  because the target audience appreciate it  little girls cannot watch a movie that has no naked buff guys in it  i can only imagine the guys who made that crap scene  ok  guys i have an idea  we will introduce a stupid character that will do pull ups naked in the barrack  but why  does not matter  but it will be very funny and in that way we please the target audience  and check that out  we will make him run naked outside the barrack because the sergeant would not let him get dressed and he will be forced to run naked during their exercises  ha ha  so funny  not  the scene where they fight the japanese  at some point the tough guy in the unit picks up a half dismembered body to use it as a shield and charged the battlefield killing   japanese  wtf  at that point i was laughing and could not believe how bad this looks  mel is becoming senile another scene when some doctor got wounded and dodds wanted to give him plasma and the doctor says  no  give it to the other guy i do not know    and he did  after several minutes we see a scene where dodds asks about the doctor and another guy says  he did not make it  he did not have the plasma   and he makes a stupid face and we as the audience understand everything  wow that was very educating  it was explained to us like we were some retards and did not understand the sacrifice he made  very poorly done  cheap the battle looked like it was made by acrobats all jumping in spectacular ways  turning  twisting  all was about guts and gore  the more gore the better  its as if the film was thought to get better with every gruesome scene over and over again  but it got worse  at some point after seeing so many body parts it became a joke  it began to fail and i was made to smile at how stupid this looks  every scene made me think how the directors were scheming and constipating with ideas that were suppose to shock us until they run out of ideas and they just put more guts  gore and blood  that will shock them i can continue to rant about this movie as every scene has flaws and does not deliver  i would not call this movie an oscar or even a mention  mel s only good movie was braveheart and i stand by that  i cant believe how easy people fall for this violence nonsense mixed with religion and patriotism  could it be that this a recipe for successful movies  or we are ashamed to admit this is a crap movie because we are afraid that others will look upon us and accuse us we do not respect history and heroes  wake up people  although we have only just nudged our way into february i nominate this as a contender for worst film of    it might even win this is a film of two halves  in fact the transition between one and the other is so abrupt that you could be forgiven for thinking you are watching two different films  the first half is comprised of two acts act   sees us in disneyland with a saccharine sweet love story told as only the americans can do with a plethora of sickly smiles  gleaming perfect white teeth  pretty pastel colours and every damn country boy and country girl cliché in the teenage book of dreamy heart fluttering romance act   army training camp  new wet behind the ears recruits and a sergeant major set on making men of them  familiar territory  you know the score  the recruits will be wheeled out fully formed and ready labelled from the casting department   the tough one  the farmer boy one  the handsome one  the oddly short one  the goofy one  and the evil one who from the off sets out to make our hero s life a misery  and the signpost also tells you that an hour down the line in this film they will be best buddies  the sergeant major now does what all sergeant majors do in every boot camp film you have ever seen he yells and screams bawls and bellows just half an inch from the face of every recruit  of course he saves the best of his decibels for our hapless hero turns out our hero does not want to carry a rifle he just wants to be a medic  so instead of congratulating him on this noble and potentially useful choice of army career he gets bawled out and they treat him like something the sergeant major scraped of the bottom of his size twelve boots but with the help of his demented dad and his pretty and expertly permed smiling gal our hero escapes a court martial  the gal gives her guy a bible  we saw that coming  part two  our hero and his buddies are gathered at the foot of a cliff  the only way up to hacksaw ridge is via a single wide rope ladder  atop the ridge are approximately a quarter of a million japanese soldiers  all is quiet  and you cannot help wondering why those evil nips  their term  not mine  have not simply chopped down the rope ladder or why they are not massed along the top lobbing mortars and grenades down on the troops below but we have been assured at the start of this epic masterpiece that we are watching a true story so we have to accept that this is how it happened  but that rope ladder still bothers me however   the troops clamber up the ladder and they are on top of the cliff – and all hell breaks loose after a bombardment from some offshore guns now let me state here that i have read about the battles against the japanese for control of the pacific islands and am fully aware of the terrible fighting that ensued  the japanese fought with suicidal recklessness not seen since medieval times  but in this film that fighting is presented in such an orgiastic way with almost pornographic detail of spilled entrails  pools of glistening blood  severed limbs  decapitated heads  mangled half torsos and spaghetti shredded legs that the suspicion is that the director and writers have intentionally set out to out gore every war film that has gone before  every time a soldier looks up a bullet neatly penetrates his helmet and skull  every time there is an explosion three men are catapulted into the air by some clever hidden device  and then there is more blood and guts and half  men screaming for their moms  the tidal wave of japs overwhelms the us soldiers and miraculously they all escape down the one rope ladder  it has   it is not shown how they get their wounded down there but hey ho    what of our hero     well he is still up top – now alone with the dead and wounded that have been left behind  a few japs take some pot shots at him but then they all disappear back to their tunnels for some chow leaving our hero free to drag the wounded to the cliff edge  this is an heroic task in itself but now he has to get them to safety  he proceeds to lower them down the two hundred feet sheer cliff face  actually there are only two blokes down there  smoking and chewing the fat  but they do a sterling job sending the wounded back to camp  oddly no one thinks to send a soldier or two – or twenty – up the trusty rope ladder to help our hero  they just hang around below waiting for the next dangling hospital candidate and so it goes on  when our exhausted hero does eventually fling himself down with a rope there just happens to be scores of his buddies waiting for him  shame they did not have the balls to go up and help him  but they all line up cinematically so that our hero can be led away at the risk of upsetting the  special relationship  we have with our pilgrim brothers and sisters on the other side of the pond – and i know my fellow countrymen will understand this – hacksaw ridge is just too american  a much better script and a british director would have delivered a subtle  more sympathetic film with less of your usual jingoism and more of the real drama and nuances of war this is a true story  a story of towering heroism  real men fighting real battles  but in this mess of a film that story has been reduced to nothing more than a comic book reality  and all concerned deserved better than that  after reading many positive reviews here and elsewhere  i was eager to see this  but to my surprise this turned out to be one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen  the first half is the cheesiest piece of hollywood cinema in recent years and the second half contains the stupidest war action ever aside from comedy  it seemed like slapstick to me  i really have no clue how people can rate this highly  a total disaster of a movie   i have seen stalks of corn with better physiques   sergeant howell  vince vaughn  director mel gibson is an action genius and along with that compliment  let us add he knows his violence  hacksaw ridge is a true and heroic sto',\n",
       "  'ry of the first conscientious objector to receive the medal of honor for bravery in battle  brave also could be any attempt to separate the film from its controversial director  but I shall   I will let the film speak for itself the contradiction is real  desmond t  doss  andrew garfield  was a seventh day adventist who not only refused to work on saturdays  but he also refused even to touch a gun  through the intervention at a court martial of his improbably brave and conflicted father  hugo weaving   doss is allowed to serve as a medic under those conditions  proving to all that he could be braver saving men at okinawa s hacksaw ridge than anyone else    men as a medic with a flair for ingenious rescuing  although director gibson is best known for his graphic depictions of violence in apocalypto and the passion of the christ  he can also be accused  along with writers andrew knight and robert schenkkan  of clichéd story telling  the film s two parts  at home and at war  follow some pretty trite set ups such as the mountain boy smitten by the nurse  the call to righteous service  the tough drill sergeant   a terrific vince vaughn  see opening quote   and the sentimental trench dialogue yet these flaws work when the story needs them to establish doss s kind heart  courage  and the essential goodness of fellow combatants as they confess they misread him and his conscientious objection  if you can forgive the almost unreal  lush setting for his youth in lynchburg  virginia  and his mooning for his future wife  dorothy  teresa palmer   then you will enjoy seeing a real hero in a real war yes  gibson knows how to depict action  not just pain  and it helps make hacksaw ridge a welcome addition to war films that tell true stories  and lest i forget  welcome back  mel  you have been redeemed  this was a wonderful depiction of immense courage in the face of adversity  one of the most intensely moving films we have ever seen  my father was a marine veteran of okinawa and i personally really appreciate the research that went into making this great movie  he never shared much of his story with me while he was alive  and though my father did not see combat in the battle depicted  this movie gave me many insights into what he saw when he was only   years old there were many times during the movie that i was moved to the point of tears  and overall this was an emotionally gripping but yet still entertaining depiction of the horrors of war and the reality faced at okinawa  highly highly recommended  do not skip seeing this in theaters  this is a sweet movie  it has   it is very very sweet  in fact  it has   it is so sweet that you can almost see the syrup dripping from the screen  and do not get fooled by the colors  this movie has a more black white feel to it  heaven or hell  good or bad  etc etc and I am confused  is this a political movie  i do not know anything about mr gibson s political views  but if this is it   I am not buying is it a religious movie  if so  what is the message  that it has   it is ok to go to war in the name of god  I am confused  so   what am i missing  well  some nuances for starters  we have this clean cut handsome james dean guy and his gorgeous sweetheart girlfriend  this is where the movie is sooo white and happy   and then we have this gruesome war where everything is very very black  and the japs are evil  end of story  is it that simple  hmm   do not think so this is a hard movie to rate  i give it     colorful nuances but a whooping     syrup bottles  and watch out   you might slip on the syrup floor on your way out from the theatre  i saw hacksaw ridge last night here s my opinion     i do not know if that was supposed to be a historically accurate movie  since they had the actual veterans that they interviewed at the end of the movie but it was more like a mel gibson snuff film glorifying the act of killing people and some weird christian stuff too  if it was supposed to be a historically accurate movie they probably should drop the scene of a bar  browning automatic rifle  gunner holding a limbless bloody human torso with one hand  like a shield  while running toward a japanese position and firing the bar with one hand  the most shocking part was that they stole the scene from saving private ryan   the soldier s started throwing   mortar rounds after bumping the bottom of the shells on their helmets  😑 as if that was done on a regular basis  there were also several grenades having the pins pulled with teeth and lightly flicking them away   fyi  if you try to do this in real life you will crack your teeth off       followed by flamethrowers that were actually more like dragon s breath  igniting dozens and dozens of japanese soldiers  all this occurring on the screen with the audience behind me audibly saying   wow  the actual cool part was when they showed the medic  heroically moving around the battlefield who ended up rescuing   men from hacksaw ridge  my one beef with this movie was that it is not a realistic interpretation of what actually happened in wwii  in any sense this was more of a comedy  glorifying gore    followed by actual interviews of real life veterans portrayed in the movie    which  seemed to insinuate that everything you just watched was historically accurate  fail  also casting vince von to play a sergeant 😑 with some opening scenes trying to mimic the full metal jacket humor  all of it     epic fail and just hard to watch on a scale of   to    the option of going to this movie or staying in my room and staring at the wall this was about a    and slightly better than staring at a wall    just when we thought all wwii stories have been told  this film offers an interesting story about a consciousness objector who chose to fight the system by serving in the military anyway as a medic  mocked as a coward  he proves himself as one of the bravest in his unit  critics here will state that it unrealistically depicted combat  but unfortunately this is hollywood  which will use artistic licenses to promote a story  brian ghilliotti i wonder what veterans of the battle had to say after watching this movie  there are many moments in this movie that make it look like marvel s story  unbelievable  was there really only one rope ladder to climb for all american troops  was there some kind of treaty with japanese not to touch the ladder and let americans climb till they reach the top and prepare for an attack  everyone was just waiting for our hero to finish  alone saving his wounded comrades  i used to respect mel gibson s work  not anymore  great graphics and high budget  of course  the standard boring music does not even matter  after you notice the big bad problem  there is no scenario  absolutely no intrigue or plot  nothing actually happens  there are no negative characters  there is no actual threat or problem to be solved  no twist  no surprise  nothing  so  boring  predictable  heroic  anachronistic  full of cliché s  no plot whatsoever  poor simple guy has small childhood trauma  grows up to be a fine man  goes to war  is a hero  now  this might be a summary of a great movie  but in our case  it is everything you will find out in this one  there is  literally  nothing else  i am afraid of saying unrealistic as well  because the character was probably pretty much as depicted  still  the portrayal is anachronistic  quite false  in fact  we have this huge powerful invading american army  smashing through all defenses of the small bad sadistic japs  as expected   no surprise here   difficult to sympathize  but anyway  need to have some baddies around   and here we have an unarmed winning hero saving the poor lives of the poor victors without consideration to his own life  while his mates massacre their enemies all around  and supporting through his actions the whole round massacre  for a not really clear reason  i mean  we love gibson and he managed to do some great cliché heroic movies  so i was expecting more from this one  just am not   are not  stop overrating because you were born in america  this does not contain any spoilers  there are a few scenes that are not medically correct so if you spend over   million dollars at least hire some good doctors to review what you are doing  george clooney said you can make a bad film out of a good script but you cannot make a good film out of a bad script  how could this film be nominated for best film but not be nominated in the screenplay category  titanic anyone    i really wanted to watch this in the cinema and did not  i made the mistake of buying it on dvd without checking which oscars it was nominated for and now a part of me wished i hadn t it is not by any means a terrible film but i did not feel emotionally involved with the characters not in the same way as i did with  saving private ryan   engaging story with competent acting  no dull moments  i am going to read  all souls  triology by harkness soon   pretty sure  will be even more exciting to read the best part is it has   it is not just another magic and supernatural crap  but a perfect blend of history  myths  fiction and romance  what else can one ask for after a tiresome day it will definitely leave you feeling   cannot wait for next episode   a long time since I have been this excited waiting for the next episode  this show is great  it has great production  good actors  believable fantasy society  the characters are adults  finally  and it grabs attention and holds it  i love it  beautiful scenery  amazing shots  interesting characters and story  cannot wait to find out more  every second packed with intensity in this first episode   I am flabbergasted  ending of the episode left me yearning for more instantly  i have not felt like this about a series since first time i watched true blood  not that they compare in any way   very catching  i certainly hope the rest of the series live up to this first episode  i was so nervous for this show as i had previously read the books by deborah harkness but it did not disappoint at all  yes  it has   it is only the first episode but each and every character was portrayed so accurately and as far as i can tell they have stuck pretty close to the novel  not completely but enough   so far so good  even though I have read the books i was still left anticipating what was to come next and i was fascinated by how they adapted from novel to screen  hopefully they continue to stick to the novel  cannot for the next episodes    i just read the books so they are so fresh in my mind and the series is different  examples characters are very different ysabeau in the book although matthew s mother was made a vampire when she was younger not an elderly woman like in the tv series  the story line is loosely based on the books but is also very different  i like the books better but the series on its own is enjoyable if i keep reminding myself it has   it is just based on the book series it has   it is not the same  worth a watch i know it has   it is just the first episode  but wow gorgeous setting  great acting  solid start to an interesting story  cannot wait for more  i made my account because i feel like this really desereves a positive review as someone who has seen lots  and lots of films   series  but also having my own fair share of knowledge of video editing  i can really appreciate the cinematography of this series  beautiful scenes and film work with overall great acting and a story that shows a lot of opportunities for this becoming an amazing series three episodes in so far  and after every episode i keep on wanting more  I am mostly writing this review because honestly  i want more  i truly hope they can keep up this quality for the rest of the season  and be renewed for a second season  as it has   it is something that I am already looking forward to tldr  great  and beautifully produced  the first thing to say about this production is that it is beautiful to look at  especially in uhd  the dreaming spires of oxford are without doubt the stars of the show  unfortunately  although the visuals are breathtaking  the editing is clunky and the writing cliched and lacking in the intensity of the   rather intrusive at times   soundtrack matthew goode is well  good  he has   he is perfectly cast and has all the mannerisms and snark that you would expect of a vampire  teresa palmer unfortunately  although she does her best with her stilted dialogue simply is not believable as an internationally acclaimed academic  the problem with being introduced as the youngest person ever to obtain tenure at yale  is that you need to act and speak with a level of intelligence and authority that makes this real  palmer just does not have the delivery or the gravitas required  as demonstrated in one of her earliest scenes when she delivers a lecture which sounds like it was written by a teenager who forgot to do their homework and dashed something off   minutes before class the main problem however  is that the opening episode simply tries to do too much too quickly  this would have worked so well as a slow burner  where the characters slowly reveal themselves over the first few hours of the show and we learn about their struggles with the identities they hold  instead we are spoonfed everything in the first   minutes with awful  rushed exposition as the main characters all but point at each other and say  you are a witch    and you are a vampire  in the most hamfisted attempt to get things moving forward I have never read the books  so i cannot comment on the quality of the source material  but i can only assume that given the luxury of several hundred pages the story unwinds in a careful  intelligent and well paced manner  it has   it is a shame that the creators of this show did not take the same approach  edit on season one finale   point for poor special effects and some cheezy momentsafter watching first episode  i thought myself if there is a real world of witchery  vampirism   demonic in   century  it should be something like a discovery of witches  so realistic  logical and believable this tv series which drags me into its story in first few minutes  with its great directing  acting  filmography and every other aspects has the potential to be the best new tv show after all cannot wait for next episodes edit on episode  it may feel slow for some people  but it has   it is the style of this series by slowly getting under your skin and i guess the pace is getting faster and faster by each episode goes on  anyhow  do not expect an action fantasy tv show  it has   it is a drama approach to fantasy world  still amazing and still   out   for me by the way  i do not think of anyone better as teresa palmer for rule of diana bishop  she is brilliant  after watching the first released trailer  i knew that this would be a must see  and it did not disappoint  a world of witches  vampires and demons  the world of paranormal creatures has drawn me in  it is full of mystery and suspense  i cannot wait for the next episode a definite watch  i do not normally write reviews but these reviews are very questionable and i wasted quality time on this show smh  if you are into the twilight and   shades of grey type of movie this show is for you  its your prototypical cheesy romance drama with mystical beings thrown in for a little spice  i kept pushing through the episodes because the reviews are really good  but now I am starting to think they have to be fake reviews  this show is insanely dull and the plot is super slow  theres barely any action  very little magic  and lots of corny  typical romance movie dialogue  maybe this would have made a better romantic movie than an entire series  but this show is overrated  unoriginal  poorly paced  and the plot is everywhere  I am guessing it was just meant to be fan service for people who already love the book  if you have not read the book  i would not suggest this  its nowhere near as good as these bogus reviews a discovery of witches is one of my favorite books so i was so nervous watching this first episode but no need they did it justice very true to the books   i watched the first episode and i love it being from the uk my self and watching other supernatural shows including  salem netflix  which was a personal favourite vampire diaries charmedthe secret circle and more this shows shows supernatural in a way not done before in a calm setting with out to overly dramatically showcasing it effectively  it shows witchcraft in a good light modern if so  with an amazing cast its something special and i can not wait for more  i cannot imagine any actress better then teresa palmer for such a role  the show isnt blasting with super special effects every   minutes  but it has   it is more then perfect for now  good pilot  amazing actors  etc  cannot wait to see how this will develop  and damn   teresa is so damn beautiful  a fantastic romantic fantasy drama  a must see  just simply beautifully played one hour a week is not enough  the first episode was quite intriguing and me and my gf was enjoying it   episode in and it has   it is just laughably bad  predictable  and generic you will love this show if you are a teenager girl between      otherwise  seriously do not bother  okay  so i never read the novel and if someone tried describing this show to me i probably would not have been interested  i love supernatural shows but the concept seemed kind of hokey  the first episode had me hooked  i love the chemistry between the two leads  you can definitely get a sense of why they are drawn to each other but it has   it is the actress that stands out to me the most  she has the right balance of intrigue  independence  and naivete and none of it comes off forced  this show is also beautifully shot  i love the cinematography and how the settings are used that jump from oxford  new england  I am guessing   and italy  much of the lore is there   with a few changes  and they have a unique spin on it  i hated true blood because of how over the top and trashy it was but this felt masterful and its strength is in its subtlety     this is definitely one of my new favorites i was so prepared to love this series  especially since it stars one of my favorite actors  matthew goode   but sadly this was not the case  the writing was painfully cliche  with some of the laziest characterizations I have seen in awhile  the lead actress is a total bore  even the music is bad  it just got worse and worse with each episode  characters who have never met onscreen suddenly know each other well  characters who have barely gotten to know each other are suddenly making declarations of undying love to one another  transitions are jarring and plot developments are endlessly frustrating  the script is tedious  i feel bad for the actors who have to speak such uninspired lines  sometimes i swear i can see matthew goode questioning his life choices as he delivers his cringiest lines  why could not the writers take what was obviously lame source material and try to make this story   level tv ready  lazy  lazy shame  what a stinker  for those who claim they read the series and thought they did a good job with this i can not believe they are real reviews deborah harkness took this genre to an entirely new level  i thinking persons level  her stories are well researched  well written and completely engaging  everything an author should be  but rarely is in this genre i have read the books so often i can recite parts of them from memory  the characters were strong  smart and likeable  even when being disagreeable this tv series contains nothing that made the books wonderful  they pretty much threw the storyline out and made another one none of the actors remotely resemble the characters in thought or action  even with the time allowed for character development that a tv series gives you over a movie  they have not taken the opportunity to do it properly terrible effort and shame for destroying a wonderful story  what to say  i have been waiting for this show with mixed emotions from the first whisper of it being done    i have wanted to see it come alive from the first book i read years ago and honestly never thought i would see it happen because of the sheer amount of plots  sub plots and the long list of primary and secondary characters that are',\n",
       "  ' constantly changing from book to book  i absolutely love the trilogy it is in my top   all time favorite book trilogies series    that said  yes it is true they moved some things around and changed parts and details around but that is to be expected when trying to have something completely visual relay the same basic understanding that reading the book does  with a book time can be taken to explain things in depth to a point that a show or movie can not accomplish unless it has a full time narrator talking constantly as the show is going  so yes  it is true that it does not follow the book to the letter however it does a good job of relying the same message one gets by reading the book  it does also jump forward at a quick pace it seems until i went back and realized just how much of the back story and details that it takes so long to cover in the book would not have worked trying to fit into the first   episodes of a show  it would have been mostly flashbacks if that route were taken  that being said  they will probably pull bits and pieces of memories out over the season as opposed to getting it all out at the beginning like the book  different types of entertainment  book and tv show  so different way of presentation  i think it has   it is off to a great start and i look forward to seeing the series unfold  wow  love it so far   the series starters as a an action packed fantasy series  but slowly the series is turning into a soap series  just watched episode    it has   it is mostly talk talk talk and scarcely any action   bummer  first two parts looked promising  dark  mysterious  unfortunately  the series went down very quickly from there  diana is absolutely annoying and unbelievably oblivious to supernatural things happening around her  despite being a professor in alchemy and raised by witches  can you be any more ignorant  the show quickly turned into a  teen  vampire drama of girl in danger with her boyfriend vampire coming for the rescue every time  all other storylines and characters feit uninteresting  too  and sort of out of place  despite being part of the whole  conspiracy  and overall picture  i was kinda hoping for better drama and more adult feel for this one  have not read the books  but i anticipated from the cast involved  and the mainly uk setting that maybe     eh   definitely in the same package with likes of vampire diaries or twilight saga  most of the dialogues were so cringeworthy  that i felt ashamed for some of the great actors being involved with this project  what a giant martyred pain in the ass teresa palmers character is   i do not think i can stomach anymore of her long tortured little girl glaring into the distance  she has   he is pretty dumb about everything  for apparently being an academic specialising in this field wasted opportunity w this series  could have been excellent  but let us be real  this is twilight fan fiction and the problem with this is that twilight was written and filmed long enough ago that we should be able to navigate around the same tropes and pitfalls  especially since these characters are fully grown adults and the characters of twilight are horny teenagers  was the cinematography all done in the vsco app  does the protagonist s spell binding curse limit her to an exclusively blue wardrobe  but like only the exact same shade as her eyes because heaven forbid we rock indigo out here   i think there was so much potential as far as the lore and magical fantasy go  the cast is pretty great  too  but somewhere along the line the writers sort of said   eff it  let us pretend anastasia steele went to oxford and had magical powers  run it through an instagram filter and make the sex even less interesting   do you know that old movie rule that you subconsciously decide whether you are going to enjoy a film or not within the first ten minutes  well  it was not true this time  because after the opening sequence  i was pretty sure i was going to hate  i am number four   thankfully  i was in for a pleasant surprise it all starts with bad cgi monsters and some guys in star trek make up chasing people around in the jungle  we then cut to some jocks doing tricks on jet skis and some bland blonde girls admiring them   and i thought this is going to be terrible  then the story picks up and the movie gets better from there the story involves a couple of characters and mysteries  but is never too complicated  after the initial jet ski scene  the main character actually turns out to be played quite charmingly by alex pettyfer  he has   he is supported by his mentor protector  solid as always  timothy olyphant   glee s dianna agron plays number four s love interest  she comes across very natural  so that the love story that unfolds is actually engaging instead of vomit inducing like that of that other movie with the whining vampires and the shirtless werewolves of course   i am number four  is by no means a great movie  the cgi sucks in places and the make up of the bad guys is just awful  characters are stereotypical  things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to  barely  fit into the running time of a popcorn movie however  i think we can all agree that it would be silly to actually expect a masterpiece  considering the movie s premise  for what it is   i am number four  is an entertaining little fantasy flick for teenagers and undemanding twenty somethings  add to that the fact that this movie is neither a sequel nor a remake  that it has   it is not based on a comic book  a tv series  a computer game or toys  and it has   it is enough to lift  i am number four  heads and shoulders above its genre competitors  ok the effects were great  the action was impressive    i mean visually  the movie was pretty good and I shall   I will even say the acting was done well  the characters were charming  the pace was slow at times  but not dead boring slow my only problem was  how many times are we going to see the exact same story  i mean this was your typical teen drama    new kid  shady past    weird and wants to stay to himself  but there has   there is always some cute chick who he risks everything for there has   there is always bullies who hate that he has   he is got the attention of the cute chick  so they always end up having a conflict  i mean    of this movie was your typical high school drama teen movie  and the  discovering  of his powers was like the alien version of spiderman i mean it has   it is the same ole same ole    you explore and try to harness your new powers beating up bullies and jumping around where no one can see you until a super strong villain pops up you have to fight in the climax i mean as far as an overall success the positive things i mentioned originally  great effects  charming characters  impressive action  can for the most part salvage the movie  but if you are a fan of the genre  do not expect anything new        outta   stars    this is not a bad film  it has   it is just not that great  the story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment  i also found myself un interested in the characters  apart from the dog  but who does not love a cute dog  it just seemed to be cliché after cliché after cliché  i have to remind myself i did not go to watch shawshank redemption   or a william shakespeare film adaptation  instead i watched   odd minutes of blah  good special effects and action sequences plus the added bonus of eye candy were just enough to save it  just if you go to see  i am number four  i suggest you leave your brain at home then sit back and enjoy the pretty lights and moving pictures  do not expect much and you might actually enjoy it  in a perfect world  the convoluted mess called i am number four could have been great  it had all the trappings for success  based off a semi popular novel for teens  a fairly accomplished director in d j  caruso  the producing  talent  of michael bay  two hot young stars in alex pettyfer and glee s own dianna agron  and an enigmatic  yet intriguing trailer campaign  so why is it that the final product is one of the most deeply unsatisfying theatrical experiences i have had in some time  opening with the death of  number three   we jump into the life of john  pettyfer   an alien being protected on earth from a group called the mogadorians  as it turns out  the mogadorians wiped out the population of john s planet years before  except for nine children with extraordinary powers  for some reason  they have to be killed in order  and with three down  john is next in line for extermination  as he goes on the run with his protector henri  timothy olyphant   they settle into the small town of paradise  ohio  soon after  john starts gaining and learning more about his powers  but with a new love  agron  and his lust to just be normal thrown into the mix  john may be in more trouble than he can imagine i have never read the source material for i am number four  but i would hazard a guess that it did a half decent job of explaining what is going on  and did not just strive to set future sequels in motion  the film on the other hand  suffers because the sequel seems to be the only thing in mind outside of special effects  we are thrown right into john s life  and we only get little nuggets of reason for what is going on at any given time  we never get full explanations  and are never even offered the ability to piece it together by ourselves  the film seems merely content giving us hints  offering little enigmatic moments to get us thinking  but instead of doing anything with these scenes  it merely continues trucking along to its eventual ending which promises a continuation and the hope for some further reasoning for what is happening  but if the filmmakers do not care about informing the audience now  why will we care later  but this would not be such a slap in the face if we had not already seen so many films in the past half decade doing the exact same thing  attempting to replicate the success of the harry potter  twilight and the lord of the rings franchises  the golden compass  cirque du freak  the vampire s assistant  the spiderwick chronicles  and percy jackson   the olympians  the lightning thief  which this film oddly resembles  are all examples of studios making films out of young adult books  specifically to capitalize on the potential for sequels and lengthy franchise possibilities  they all failed in varying degrees  because they all suffer from the same thing i am number four suffers from – not enough plot  too much dependence on a sequel  had all of these films even attempted to be able to stand on their own  perhaps they would have gotten the sequel they seemed to think they deserved  i know four is part of a proposed book franchise  as opposed to an already established book franchise  but it merely skipped the waiting in the middle for the eventual film should these plot and sequel problems not already be enough  four suffers from copying twilight a little too close  even including the notable musical cues from current alt rockers   sure  there are no vampires  but the romance between john and agron s sarah feels a little too forced for comfort  right in the middle of being hunted down to be systematically wiped out  we are supposed to believe that someone who has spent their life running  would simply fall in love out of the blue  and not feel any consequences  we are supposed to believe he does not know better  sure he has   he is a teenager and we all did stupid things when we were that young  but why does the focus of the film seem to hinge on the chemistry and romance between these two star crossed lovers  i was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion  and the need for john and henri to keep running to avoid death  but then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story  and totally loses anything it has going for it  a last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of sci fi is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst  it is awkward  silly  and practically plagiarizes twilight i will say i was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story  but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop  the film criminally underuses olyphant  the only actor who actually acts in the entire film  and makes him into an almost useless background character  we only get glimpses of teresa palmer s character throughout the film  the trailer already gives away any mystery of who she might be   and when she finally shows up to do something  she merely speaks in overtly sexual allusions  pettyfer and agron both seem to suffer from not knowing what emphasis to put on their character and when  and relative newcomer callan mcauliffe is stuck in the cliché ridden role as the know it all geek of a best friend when it attempts to work  i am number four is quite interesting  i would have loved more story  and a whole lot less romance  even what does work  including the decent special effects  seems to suffer as a result of all the melodramatic romance      this review also appeared on http   www geekspeakmagazine com   this movie is not the best action film of the year  this movie is not another tongue in cheek teen movie  most importantly  this movie is not a  wannabe  of the twilight franchise  this movie is entertainment for all viewers that delivers a good story  action  and desire to want more at the end  i was lucky enough to work as an extra in this movie for about   weeks and was able to see how this film came together  piece by piece  the visual effects truly make the film enjoyable  seeing it behind the scenes  i could not imagine what it would look like  to be honest  i was pleasantly surprised the acting was believable and consistent  unlike previous reviews who claim the actors lost steam halfway thru the film   timothy olyphant is perhaps the best character in the film  pettyfer following right after  the best part about this film  the love story within the plot was not painful annoying to watch  such as twilight  this movie is definitely worth seeing in theaters  as the action scenes truly make the experience  i am number four is a great start to what could be a fantastic franchise  based on the ny times best selling novel by  pittacus lore   an alias for the memoir fabricating james frey and jobie hughes   i am four kicks off the cinematic proceedings with an intense and creepy jungle chase scene and an intriguing   albeit fairly unoriginal   concept the planet lorien  cough krypton cough  was destroyed  and nine of its alien children were sent to earth  why earth  who knows  perhaps earth s atmosphere is the most similar to lorien s  a race of   foot tall humanoids called the mogadorians are hunting down the children one at a time  why  beats me  because we would not have a story otherwise  i suppose  all we are really told is  they are a race who chooses to decimate rather than colonize   so be it anyway  due to some sort of spell the mogadorians are forced to kill the nine remaining lorien kids in the proper order  who established the order and how  no idea  would not you be pretty ticked off if you were number one and became aware that you were chosen to be killed first  perhaps the numbering system is completely random  otherwise  that has   that is a pretty jacked up system   hmm  little billy seems to be a little slow upstairs  and that lisp sure am not   are not doin  him any favors  let us make him number one   regardless  numbers one to three are now dead  so the story focuses on number four number four s desperate attempts to fit in lead to yet another blown cover  and he and his guardian henri must once again relocate   this time to the small town of paradise  oh  following the film s somewhat promising start  the story takes an ill advised detour and bogs down in a teenage romance marsh  it has   it is at this point that number four  aka john smith  falls in love  defends a nerd against bullies  and begins to discover his unique abilities  known as legacies  this blatant drawing from the well of the twilight series  formula might giddy up the hearts of teenage girls  but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film s trailer promised that arrival comes in the film s third act in the form of a deus ex machina known as number six  teresa palmer  who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rumpage against the backdrop of cgi and special effects  the last   minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences  but the drive there should have been smoother and more evenly paced dialogue is weak  character development is practically non existent  and the underdeveloped backstory creates too many questions that lead to frustration rather than intrigue  granted  this is an origin story that has   that is specifically designed to kick start a franchise  but a little more self containment would have been appreciated one of the film s biggest transgressions is the misuse of timothy olyphant as henri  we are told that he has   he is a lorien warrior  and as such you had   you would expect him to join in the butt kickery  unfortunately  he has   he is only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped  done off screen to mask its implausibility  by a couple of out of shape alien conspiracy theorists  his role is more of a babysitter for number four than a warrior guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom the film presents a seed or two of hope that the franchise can improve with each installment  but will its identity crisis allow it to do so  attempting to be all things to all teenagers could backfire if it fails to create loyalty amongst any one demographic teenage audiences and those who do not consume themselves with the story s many flaws will be more forgiving than i  perhaps your expectations will be exceeded  but there has   there is a good chance you shall   you will be either underwhelmed or disappointed  would not you rather risk a dollar at redbox than    a pop at the theater  do not say i did not properly inform you  a great movie will leave you yearning for a sequel  and i am number four certainly does  first off  the visuals were astounding  this really goes without saying  but the final battle in the movie was incredible  another sign of a great movie  my friends and i truly liked the characters  we actually cared about what happened to them  something that i cannot say about other book to movie harry potter wannabes   even number six  a bad ass female with nightcrawler like power was lovable finally  the storyline was engaging and easy to understand  yes  there were some unexplained portions  but this is only the first movie in a series  i understood it just fine without having read the book  and there was no point in the movie where i felt that things were moving too slowly  nor to quickly  for that matter  i would urge you not to take any of the negative reviews written by middle aged men to heart   spend the   bucks and give this movie a chance  i promise you that you shall   you will end up enjoying it  if you liked the movie  the covenant   which is about a teen coming into his super powers while falling in love with a brainy yet implausibly beautiful girl who spends most of the film standing agog at what he can do  then you probably will not like  i am number four  for the simple reason that you are no longer a   year old girl and this movie is almost a direct remake the film starts out demonstrating how cool the main character is by showing him doing various tricks on a jet ski while maintaining perfect hair  i half expected one of his friends to shout  radical    but then i remembered that this was not made in the mid    from there it pretty much degenerates into a checklist of crappy movie clichés  brooding teen trying to fit in even though his power causes him to be different  check  generic bullies not realizing who they are messing with and getting their comeuppance  check  bad guys using girl t',\n",
       "  'o get to main character  yup  love for the girl giving the hero new strength to continue even though all looks hopeless  double check if you are looking for a movie you can turn off your brain and enjoy then i recommend renting one of the xmen movies  if you are a girl who has just entered her teens and is tired of movies about whiny vampires  then you might enjoy this  but do not expect to remember it a week later  i was thinking this would be filler for a dull afternoon  indeed it was but i was also surprised to find i really enjoyed it  we also had the pleasure of watching it on imax so that makes just about anything a little better  if you want to enjoy the evening then go see this one  you shall   you will see some good acting and decent new actors  give it a chance and i think this might be the next good  series  of movies you shall   you will like  i say series because they left this one wide open to find numbers    and      i can easily see a whole trilogy or more just waiting for this one to make enough money to get it going  although without some decent advertising they are not   am not going to get that       we loved i am number four  the storyline was good  good love interest teen romance  number six is totally smoking sexy hot  good strong female characters  the cast  acting    special effects reminded me of disney s race to witch mountain which we also enjoyed  only complaints spoiler alert  there is a missing scene at the end when a character you thought was dead suddenly appeared alive without any explanation  they leave it open for a sequel which we would love to see  what has   what is up with the jock  is he alive  dead  converted to an evil zombie for the sequel  the director did not show why the jock had a life transformation and is now nice  that is our only complaint  read some of the reviews on here so was unsure what to make of this  but loved the movie and was surprised how well it rolled  the special effects were superb as were the action scenes  not sure why some slammed this movie but i have no problem giving this a    if your looking for a good weekend movie slouching on the couch eating pizza then this is the business if your a sci fan such as myself then this is a watchable movie very watchable  i was worried that the relationship between the main character and the photographer would run away with itself and overtake the plot as is seen is so many decent movies ruined by pointless teen relationships  but i am number   did not let this happen and it glued with the plot really well  the fight scenes were well scripted and did not go on for too long  get the popcorn out sit back and enjoy this scifi flick i do not think you will be disappointed  my god  words cannot reiterate how terrible this movie is  i did not go with high expectations  i did not expect oscar winning performances or a witty and sharp script etc  i thought if i could give it a five or a six out of ten at most i would be satisfied with some great action  good special effects and reasonable acting  but it did not even have that  seriously the reviewers who have given this higher than a four have seriously deluded themselves  I am not a teenager  which this film is aiming for  but even then it has   it is so badly made even they should not like this  before i critique this film  a brief synopsis from what i can gather  teenager john smith  alex pettyfer from storm breakers  who is an alien from another planet lorien is a fugitive on the run from his enemies the mogadarians who have been sent to destroy him after killing three other kids before him with the same abilities  changing his identity  moving from town to town with his guardian henri  timothy olyphant   john is always the new kid with no ties to his past  in the small ohio town he now calls home  john encounters unexpected  life changing events his first love sarah  dianna agron   powerful new abilities and a connection to the others like number six  teresa palmer  who shares his destiny  the first problem of this film is the screenplay which is a horrific mess  the synopsis i had to cobble together from a family friend who is a fan of the books  but was not of the film   it is very loosely explained during the movie at different points with huge plot holes  if these mogadarians want to destroy earth  why do not they straight away  why kill these teenagers who are a part of the legacy  how were the legacies and mogadarians created  why do the mogadarians want to destroy earth  i think i heard something about  resources   but what  maybe this is explained in the book or subsequent ones  i do not know  but for someone who has not read them  things should have been explained and more clearly  it has   it is no excuse  also when john saves sarah from her ex boyfriend and his friends pestering her at the fair  she sees him using his powers  his hands light up  to deal with the guys  but she dosen t say anything    what the heck  then later she suddenly  finds  out  this sort of thing just reeks serious laziness on the hand of the writers  either that or during that scene sarah went temporarily blind  i could go on with several other plot holes  but you get the point  the structure of the film is terribly put together with certain scenes just feeling so random  without them being linked together  maybe the fact the film just suddenly decides to introduce new information in a convenient  way  like those weird creatures who guard the legacies  including a dog that turns into the creature  and the others for the mogodarian s or whatever  and while we are on the subject of the mogodarian s as villains they are ridiculously laughable and not scary in the slightest  all the characters are bland with little back story like we find out literally nothing about john s past or his parents  with that you just do not care about them as they are little more than cardboard cut outs  particularly when henri dies  in one scene with  sad  music  we are meant to care but the characters are so shallow and boring we just do not care and the whole pathetic scene just comes across as sickeningly insincere  of course the characters being boring also comes down to terrible performances  alex pettyfer is just unbearably plain and looks and acts bored  he has not got the slightest trace of acting ability  just like in stormbreakers   none of the cast fare any better  they are all unconvincing and give some of the worst performances I have seen in films  even teresa palmer who i adored in the sorcerer s apprentice could not save this  she looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue  i could not judge her acting as such though her voice when i heard it sounded like she was trying to be sexy with a sore throat  the trollop scriptwriter who put in the embarrassingly awful and very cheesy not funny script that she should speak like that needs a slap i am number four tries to come across as a romantic sci fi action  but it has little action  for teen boys   only about ten minutes and even when there was  the camera jerked up and down with a shocking lack of continuity i felt dizzy and could not make out what was going on so as a result there is no excitement you feel in  watching  the action   michael bay who was the producer of this and still has not learnt from transformers    and little romance  for teen girls   with little romance or action  the film just pointlessly meanders itself sluggishly from scene to scene  in terms of the  romance  there is no chemistry between john and sarah and even the special effects are very poor and look too obvious  the film is way too predictable with stereotypes across the board which you will notice straight away making it unimaginative and repetitive like the rest of the film  i paid £    to see this abomination  i wish i hadn t  this is the first turkey of the year I have awarded for a film  suppose it was only a matter of time   this is just complete rubbish and i would not advise anyone to see this travesty  there will be sequels unfortunately but i certainly will not be signing up to see it  i would rather throw up thanks then put myself through seeing another one of these  trust me i am number four is that crap  i would seriously advise you to skip it  it is one of the worst films i have ever encountered  i was lucky and saw an advanced screening on this film and i was half disappointed and half impressed  first of all  i read the book and i just thought that they left out a lot of detail from the book  some big ones too  but  the visuals and action is what kept me on my seat  the story  i thought they did a decent job with  but if they sticked with parts of the story in the book  it would have been a better film  they could have made the movie longer and added some other details from the book  i mean  in the book  henri and john can open the chest he hides together  they open it in the book  and henri lays john down on the table and pulls out a rock like crystal from the chest and it appears as their planet  lorien  and with that  henri shows what happened on their planet the day it was invaded by the mogadoriens  visually  they could have put that part in the movie  i thought it was a somewhat big part  but overall  a decent flick if you have nothing else to do or see  check it out  i am number four  i saw an advance screening of the flick tonight  the only reason i went and saw it was because my buddy had a free screening pass for    and it has   it is a free screening  i remember reading the book and not being very impressed  however i cannot say i can pinpoint exactly what has   what is been left out since i had forgotten most of it  not sure if i even care now that I have seen both ends of the spectrum caruso tries a lot to hide the book s flaws  and he really does try hard  but somehow he only makes them more obvious  I shall   I will admit there was tonnes of action and good special effects  but really  when the story was not stealing from other sci fi  animorphs  johnny mnemonic  superman  there has   there is even an insulting john carpenter s the thing nod too   it was overloading the audience s brain with clichés that can be found in almost any teen movie    ever  and some gigantic plot holes you could drive a tanker through the action scenes i nearly left the cinema they were so bad  it has   it is like caruso told the camera crew to zoom in really close while holding the camera and shake it all about  shine flashlights in the camera lens  and move it violently when some gets punched  shaky camera and quick cutting must die  I am tired of it the soundtrack was so bombastic and over the top  at times it sounds like the boom mic is being banged against the inside of a   gallon drum  at others it has   it is like they are attacking their strings as fast as they can really fast  the film s opening score piece over the panning shot is especially insulting  it does not help that it lasts a minute long and the cue s buildup is hilarious i know the movie is based on a book  but with even that said  there is a tonne of clichés  hot chick who loves photography  check  new kid is instantly buds with the nerd  check  douchebag jock who loves the hot chick  check  kid finds out he has powers he cannot control  check  evil villain are following kid and guardian  check  kid s guardian dies and he must do the mission without him  check there has   there is also an annoying homo erotic undercurrent between sam and  john   also  do not get me started on the thirty sue pileup that is number   for every cliché  there has   there is a gigantic plot hole  why is not the grocery clerk suspicious of an alien with a hoodie and sunglasses buying a crap load of turkeys  how is  john  unable to control his powers in class yet able to control them perfectly in his backyard a matter of hours later  why do the mogadorian       speak with jamaican accents  how is the dog able to become all super dog all of a sudden  why are lorien so perfectly humanoid with a true lack of alien qualities  and how do lorien copulate  yeah  let us not go there  because the last thing this film needs is a lorien sex scene  of course   i am number four  is by no means a great movie  characters are stereotypical  things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to  barely  fit into the running time of   minutes  the story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment like if the nine aliens are so powerful  why cannot they stop those mogadorians  is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster  oh wait  number four also have one of those  is it their appearance  or is it unexplained  I have never read this book before  lack of narratives  they never mentioned why kill them in sequence  but however  this is not a bad film  it has   it is just not that great  among the good points  the visuals were astounding  the final battle in the movie is something that save the movie from being a huge disappointed  the last   minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences  and also the villains are pretty cool  there gigantic  bald  covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth  carry some pretty cool weapons  and have   gigantic beasts as pets the main problem is the movie is totally clichéd  i mean how many times are we going to see the exact same story  i mean this was your typical teen drama\\x85 new kid  shady past\\x85 weird and wants to stay to himself  but there has   there is always some cute chick who he risks everything for  there has   there is always bullies who hate that he has   he is got the attention of the cute chick  so they always end up having a conflict  i mean    of this movie was your typical high school drama teen movie  and the  discovering  of his powers was like the alien version of spiderman  i will say i was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story  but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop this twilight series  formula might cheer up the hearts of teenage girls  but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film s trailer promised  i was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion  and the need for john and henri to keep running to avoid death  but then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story  and totally loses anything it has going for it  a last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of sci fi in the form of a machina known as number six  teresa palmer  who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rampage against the backdrop of cgi and special effects  is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst acting wise  alex pettyfer is just plain with no expression but of course teenage girls will love him for his looks and physique  dianna agron is pretty and acts fine  teresa palmer who i adored in the sorcerer s apprentice looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue  kevin durand as the mogadorian commander is good in his evil act  but one of the film s biggest disappointed is the misuse of timothy olyphant as henri  the film criminally under uses olyphant  the only actor who actually acts in the entire film  and makes him into an almost useless background character  we are told that he has   he is a lorien warrior  and as such you had   you would expect him to join in the butt  kickery  unfortunately  he has   he is only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped  his role is more of a babysitter for number four than a warrior guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom  and then there has   there is the relative newcomer callan mcauliffe stuck in the cliché  ridden role as the know it all geek of a best friend though he has   he is fine in whatever he has all this said  though this movie is not the best action film of the year  its still worth a watch for the cgi and the last act of the movie  this is the first installment of the probable trilogy or more  so let us just hope they do it right in the sequels  i rate it     out out    watched the movie  i am number four  tonight  the first   minutes it felt like i was watching a re hashed  twilight  movie rather than a sci fi horror pic  but then it got good  it was well worth the watch if you can make it through that first half of beaten to death formula high school angst movies that twilight has seemed to spawn  you can bet that there will be sequels too  but they may be straight to video  the first half of the movie i give it   star  but it was the fault of the story  not the acting  the second half  i give it   stars  the acting was good  there were very nice special effects and some pretty cool alien bad guys in the style of  pinhead   I shall   I will be honest here  i am number four is a yawn  and when I am not counting minutes till it has   it is over  I am snickering at the amazingly cheesy lines  seriously  i have not watched a movie with lamer lines since the twilight series which was a shame  really  since i was so anticipating this movie because a  alex pettyfer was so cute in stormbreaker and I had   I would like to see more of him  b  i love diana agron  and c  i love a good teen drama superpower movie  but ianf was such a disappointment in the way that there has   there is nothing believable about the movie at all so the mogadorians want to kill the   surviving lorien kids with superpowers  called legacies   why  it has   it is not really clear  ethnic cleansing perhaps  one of the characters explained how the  mogs  do not colonize  but decimate instead  so why go to all the trouble of searching for the   scattered in all corners of the world  why not wipe out earth and be done with it anyway since they live to destroy anyway  right  it did not help that right when number four s number is up  pun intended   he decides he wants to be  normal  and  go to school   and the overprotective guardian said yes  sure  what has   what is a murderous predator compared to listening to your teenage ward s whining     right  and what has   what is with number four s propensity to constantly ignore  sound  life saving  advice anyway  is he trying to get killed  or is it that it has   it is more interesting to have a character that breaks all the rules since the main character never dies  anyway right  all in all  I had   I would say the movie s a flop  the characters are either annoying  unmemorable or carbon cutouts of every other movie  the appearance of number six makes it slightly more interesting but in the end she has   he is just a blonde version of megan fox  the script was painfully shallow and the story s just   meh  this is quite a strange movie and i could not determine whether it was a horror  a sci fi  or a thriller  imdb describes it as an action sci fi thriller  though i would have to add elements of horror into this film  the horror elements is that the film is set in a small american town  though it is noticeable that main street has not yet been destroyed by walmart  name paradise  horror films always seem to be set in places with pleasant sounding names   the scene is generally dark and dreary  and the main characters are up against an mysterious force that is substantially more powerful than they are  actually  a lot of films with the sci fi moniker tend to actually be horror movies  and the only reason that they are sci fi is because they involve aliens or futuristic scenes or technology  i am now thinking that sci fi is not actually a genre in itself  but rather a thematic setting  since most sci fi films will fall into action  horror  thriller  romance  and i will throw in fantasy as that is probably a genre in itself  though it is probably better classified as epic  this film is about a teenager  obviously so that it will appeal to a younger audience  who turns out to be from another planet  his planet was destroyed by a race known as the mogadorians however he and a few others managed to escape from their planet and are hiding on ea',\n",
       "  'rth  the catch is that the mogadorians have found their hiding place and have traveled to earth to locate them  they have already killed three of them  and now they are after him what we also learn of the hero  whose name is john smith as he is trying to hide  is that he is of a special breed from his planet and as he grows older he develops extraordinary powers  we do not know if the powers are standardised or unique to each individual  though when we meet number six we suspect that it is the later  the other interesting aspect of this film is the nature of modern technology  while john smith is attempting to hide and remain hidden  with the internet he is finding this very difficult  further he has the urges of your average teenager to go to school and to socialise  however it is difficult to remain hidden in an american highschool as if you are a jock  then you will be noticed  and if you shun the jock culture  then you attract attention to yourself i guess another aspect of this film is about fitting in  in a way john wants to have a normal life  even if it involves not fitting in  we notice that he is the all american handsome hero  though he rejects that culture and befriends the school geek  and it turns out there is some connection between the school geek and his people  and the girl that has been turned into an outcast  and we also learn why she becomes an outcast   however  while at the beginning this film is about the new kid fitting in  it becomes clear that he goes from being the outcast  chased by the police as he is strange and different  to being the saviour  it should be remembered  even though it is not explicitly stated  that once the mogadorians  whose appearance are quite monstrous in itself  have finished with their prey  they will turn onto the people of earth  and without these protectors  they will not have a chance  once again it shows that desire of the developed world to have a saviour that can stand up to the threats the we face on a daily basis  unfortunately  unless one includes jesus christ in the fold  and christ is not a superman in that sense of the word – he came and died so that we might be reconciled to the father  not to step up and defeat every evil force that comes our way  especially since evil in itself is quite subjective   i have complained many times about the films which pretend to capture the same childish spirit from harry potter  however  the flood of harry potter imitators seems to have diminished in recent months  the reason  the success of the twilight saga provoked a  change of direction  from the hollywood executives  and instead of exploring variations of  magic boys save the world   they are now desperately searching for new instances of  forbidden romances between teenagers with supernatural powers   for better or for worse  i am number four belongs to this nascent sub genus  and i found it to be boring and lacking of any emotion and originality i am number four covers a well known ground from the fantastic cinema as well as from the juvenile romance one  and i am not precisely against of that  director d j  caruso previously made two unoriginal but dynamic and entertaining movies  disturbia and eagle eye   something which gave me hopes of finding some redeemable elements in i am number four  unfortunately  very few things worked in this movie  at least in my personal experience   because i could never get interested in the characters or in their forced romance  and much less in the horribly trite sci fi concepts with which it pretends to adorn its tiring narrative to start with   mogadorians  was that the best name which came to mind to author pittacus lore  in fact a pseudonym of jobie hughes and james frey  for the villains of the book on which this movie was based  sure  the name by itself does not have too much importance  but it is a good example of the creativity level from the whole film  the heroes are handsome young people who look like models  the villains are bald and pale  with piranha teeth  and they suffer from the  talkative villain syndrome   revealing their plans or talking more than they should when they could easily exterminate the heroes one of the few things i liked in i am number four is teresa palmer s energetic performance  in fact  i think the film would have been much more entertaining with her in the leading role  instead of the insipid couple of alex pettyfer and dianna agron  however  i cannot recommend this film  because i found it to be bland  repetitive and tedious  let us try to go back to    we got  eagle eye   it has   it is a mixture of various sci fi flicks  now we have  i am number four   yeah it has   it is based on a book  but everything you see is familiar  i just noticed most of caruso s sci fi movies have clichéd ideas  is it the writer s fault  some of the dialog is also generic  the special effects looks so homemade look at the lasers   the actors have murmur problem   i am number four  is underrated in a bad way if the nine aliens are so powerful  why cannot they stop those mogadorians  is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster  oh wait  number four also have one of those  is it their appearance  or is it unexplained  I have never read this book before  lack of narratives  they never mentioned why kill them in sequence the action scenes  well d j  caruso is good at one of those  but here it has   it is messed up  the special effects is so inferior it felt like they used adobe after effect except those giant monsters but still looks cheap   the effects ruined the action of this film  clashing unreal things and look at those colors  the lasers the performances  alex pettyfer thinks he has   he is cool but he has   he is obviously not  teresa palmer is hot but she only kicks ass in the third act  timothy olyphant was disappointing  a pro actor playing a boring guardian overall  i am number four  is as lifeless as  twilight  sequels   or more lifeless i guess  the action scenes could have been better  the characters thinks they are cool and awesome  they are dull actually  the rest is cliché  generic  etc  is it worth watching  no  how about skipping the first and second act  the third act is the only entertaining part of the movie  but I am warning you  it has   it is an easy generic forgettable film  an entertaining  visually fun film that misses out on the most important parts of a movie  the story and it has   it is characters  i am number four tells the story of the last remaining aliens from an extinct planet that are being hunted down and killed by the aliens that exterminated it  there are   teenage special aliens left and these are the ones that the bad aliens are after  these special aliens also have a guardian who was a warrior on their alien planet whose sole duty is to protect them  oh  and these special aliens have abilities that range from moving object with their minds  super human strength  invisibility  etc  got all that  because that alone make me have all kinds of questions that never get answered  the film follows  if you can guess  the number four alien  played by alex pettyfer  and his guardian  played by timothy olyphant we are told that the first three aliens have already been killed and that four is on the run with his guardian to paradise  ohio  there  he predictably gets tired of being told to hide in their house  so he starts to attend the high school  where he befriends the local nerd  falls in love with the star quarterback s ex girlfriend  and of course fights with the star quarterback and the other jocks  meanwhile he starts to gain his abilities and strengths  all the while this is happening the bad aliens are closing in on them as well as a mysterious blonde girl  this all occurs over about an hour and fifteen minutes which really is a shame  because the last   minutes when the bad aliens and four fight is extremely fun and entertaining  it has   it is one of the better action scenes I have seen in a while  the big problem being it takes way too long for it to reach the screen there are many problems with the story  but mainly they just leave way too many questions unanswered  and this is mainly because the whole film is set up for a franchise with multiple films  this is also what happens when you adapt a novel into a film  there has   there is always going to be aspects left out  but you have to choose what has   what is essential to the story and not  and the writers chose the wrong things  the cast really is not anything to talk about  they just look good on screen but are essentially television actors  but it has   it is not totally their fault they are working with that caliber of a script some of the good things about the film come mainly from d j  caruso  he knows what he has   he is doing when it comes to teenage action movies  this is not as good as disturbia  whose success is mainly due to shia labeouf   but he does what he can with the script and the action scenes are where he shines and pulls you out of the coma you have fallen in to  it was also kind of cool to see an action science fiction film based around the high school scenario even though they missed the mark where others have succeeded  like the faculty  lastly  the villains are pretty cool  there gigantic  bald  covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth  carry some pretty cool weapons  and have   gigantic beasts as pets overall  its not worth the    or more you shall   you will have to spend to see it  if you want to sneak in for the last   minutes i would highly recommend that or just wait until blu ray dvd  if you have seen the show smallville and jumper it has   it is essentially those   put together with a sprinkle of the twilight movies  caruso does his best with some very cool and entertaining action scenes but the script is just too bare and full of holes for him to save it  the same goes with the cast  even if they were all very talented actors I am still not sure it would be a worthwhile movie  with all that being said i would probably go see the sequels because of the last action scene and just to see if some of my questions are answered or just save some money and read the books    this movie actually has an interesting story  a not entirely  but at least partly original idea  it should be a good movie about aliens hunting down other aliens on earthly settings  well its not a good movie at all  oh boy is this one baaad      this made me really angry    first of all  the main character is a totally unlikable little sissy boy  the actor has no talent at all he has like three facial expression  the  i am messed up  look  the  i am angry  look and do not forget the  awww i am totally like a cute puppy  are you girls feeling hawt already   look and that has   that is about it  not just the actor  but the character is unlikable too  he is supposed to be a survivor  a teen from another planet  who is super duper strong and one of the last of his kind  and does he have a sense of nobleness or class  no  does he have a sense of danger or urgency  no  when it is established that the same race  which destroyed his home  is out to kill him  does he listen to his mentor s advice and stays home  of course not  he keeps whining  that he needs to blend in and stuff  when an entire group of outer space assassins are out to kill you  and they already killed almost every single one of your race  do not you have more pressing matters  than go to school and try to be the  kool  jet sky flipping kid      for example  like    i do not know   planning to escape the situation  train yourself for battle  plan a revenge  oh come on  that has   that is not so interesting for teenage girls      they want to see the ufo go to high school and jet sky  because he is so hawt      so he shall do that   its pretty bad when the only thing you can think of to do with your main character is blatant fangirl service  go ahead little fangirls get offended and rate me down for this  but this is pathetic  oh and if you want to make another crappy  nerds and jocks and love in high school with odd girl and hawt boy  its okay  fine by me  but do not lie to me with a trailer like this movie had  the trailer promised an action packed sci fi movie and   minutes into the film i had to listen to god awful dialoge about odd girls photographing habits and even more awful scenes with odd girls parents having little family dinners with ufo pretty boy   what the        i am sick and tired of these holly jolly pink teenage love stories  please do not try to force them down on my throat when i am promised to see a movie about aliens fighting for their lives  i could go on about how unimaginative all the aliens  good and bad alike  were  or how this movie had the most awkward dialogue i heard in years  or how stupid it is that after ufo boys little light show on the beach or in the class room nobody really cared  in reality after a show like that on a beach at night during a party  well it would draw much more attention and it would be in the news for days    but why talk about these things  this movie flat out lied about its intentions and it is sad and pathetic  seriously   i cannot believe anybody  except maybe a dumb   yr old boy  to think this was a good movie  everyone else is probably embarrassed by this movie even existing  if this is what the author wrote and published then the published world deserves to fail  this movie is that bad forget the flat unrealistic unclever dialog  honestly how many time does the word freak appear the screen play   must be at least a     forget the stupidity of the plot  forget the bad special effects  forget the ridiculous premise that has been repeated ad nausea  forget even that every five minutes is just a musical montage of emotion too intense for words and only music to express their complexity  who ever wrote this must have been a   yr old boy whose total world experience must be watching reruns of   and the cw channel  oh and his parent probably live in an all white neighbor hood and home schooled the moron  what I am hinting at is adolf hitler would have no problems with this movie  hint  hint  in fact  this is a movie i would have expected to be made in the early nineties   on tv  a typical high school where even the black guy looks like a blonde white super model   no wait that is a blonde white supermodel just  urban ly dressed   where they all love to party  go water skiing  and hang out in the woods and drink beer  what is this   american graffiti    the main guy is of course is a shy troubled  always troubled   intensely private young man guarding a secret that he is an alien with super powers  and of course he has a parental guardian warrior of sorts he is rebelling against when he goes thru his own form of puberty and urges trying to control it all  there has   there is of course a pretty girl  there has   there is a bully who is so unrealistic that the geeks would probably make fun of him by now you should be groaning  sorry  I shall   I will stop in the words of roger ebert   this movie sucks   in toto there is not one redeeming feature of this movie  i can only imagine that the positive reviews on here are actually the studios own hired goons writing up fake positive reviews in short  do not see this movie  saw an advance screening of this and thought it was terrible  the first two minutes start out great  with a pulse pounding scene that grabs you by the throat and gets you immediately interested  but it has   it is all downhill from there  having the revelation that the lead characters are aliens be given away so early in the film  in a terrible voice over to boot  took most of the wind out of this movie s sails for me  the villains are over the top in a bad way  the dialogue is horrible  and is delivered by actors who seem to be trying their best for a while  but eventually seem to stop caring and give terrible performances as a result of the lack of material to work with  it felt like an hour and a half long bad smallville episode  which seems about right since it has   it is written by a former smallville writer  the movie had potential  had they taken more time on the script  it dives straight into the movie and if you are thinking  whats going on   do not worry  everyone else is thinking that exact same thing  and they shoot out clues like a troubled teen with a gun  and do we really need to suffer through the dramatic  oh  i so want to kiss her  so i am going dramatically string along the unbearable seconds and then brush her hair out of her face  what are you telling her  i think you should spend more time brushing your hair anyways  besides that some cool action scenes    or   that i can remember  had the typical drama with all movies with a hero  a guy  a girl   i cannot handle the path I am on    i want both  to follow the path and the woman   and  I am such a boob my ovaries are protruding      blah  blah  blah  i personally think this movie is one of the greatest horror movies ever  teresa palmer and gabriel bateman s acting is very good  absolutely credible  almost like rosa byrne s performance in insidious  which was flawless  the cinematography was good  dark scenes pretty clear  intense sound effects well achieved if you go to the cinema with your childhood fears  you will really enjoy this movie  it has   it is full of scares and if you put attention to them  they are the kind of scares that you really fear when you are a kid i do not understand why people cannot leave their critics attitude at home and simply enjoy this movie or any other movie  if they do it  you shall   you will enjoy it a lot  lights out is an interesting stab at a horror movie based on a   short film of the same name  the movie s novel concept is a creature that can only be seen and manifest in the dark  turn a torch on  and it disappears  naturally  this means that a lot of the movie is spent in the dark but this works well the use of lighting is one of the movie s strong points and allows for some creative  and occasionally funny  uses of torches  candles and even car headlights  this technique generates a lot of the scares and atmosphere and given the movie s title  this is a must  definitely top marks for the director on this part teresa palmer and gabriel bateman do well in the lead roles as the unfortunate kids with a crazy mother  played by maria bello  the problem with the movie is that apart from its main concept  it does not add much else  clichés abound and yes  there is the mandatory dark basement  groan   most of the scares are jump out at  you shocks and it has   it is all been done before  hollywood seems to have forgotten how to use psychological horror and churns out movies that are just twists on the same theme  this is probably a bit harsh as the movie is enjoyable enough and it has   it is well written  but i long for something new that is not so long in the tooth the supernatural horror is effective and does elicit a genuine threat to the characters  maria bello  in particular  does well to ramp up the threat levels and makes you wonder who is going to make it out alive  as already mentioned  this was based on a short film and it really still is  coming in at around   minutes  perhaps there was not enough material to make a longer movie but there has   there is a feeling that it ends just as it gets going lights out is a decent film if you feel the need for a dash of supernatural horror but do not expect anything stand out  it just does not deliver enough of a impact to make it memorable  it has   it is good for what it does but do not buy too much popcorn as you may not have time to finish it  this movie will get your pulse up fast  revealing the  horror  very early on  interestingly enough  it keeps that pulse up throughout the movie despite of this  the concept of something that can only appear and be seen if it has   it is dark  and with a somewhat supernatural ability to destroy light bulbs  is bound to lead to a jump scare or ten whenever it appears  towards the end you have almost gotten so used to it that the scare effect wears off a bit  and is one of two reason i do not rank this a    but thanks to a good story and good actors  the movie still holds its ground to the very end the characters are really good  well written and performed ',\n",
       "  ' and with a young boy that if not before  totally kick started his future acting career with this movie  who does not love a young prodigy  the plot has some weight and emotion to it  and with a solid ending that wraps things up in a much more satisfying way than most similar movies the other small drawback with this movie for me was mostly because of slightly unrealistic behavior from our main characters  occasionally  like when miss heels from jurrasic world is worried that when she releases t rex it will not be able to follow her if she runs  so  she waits for it to come close  walks for a bit  then runs  those kinds of unrealistic behaviors  but I have seen much worse  and this movie does not take the  unrealistic  very far  or often  so i suggest you just put this on and roll with it all in all you get everything you want from a jump scare movie with lights out  with a good plot and good actors that deliver  and a scare factor we all can relate to  you might not be so happy with turning of your lights going to bed later that night  so if you have a weak stomach you might wanna sit this one out  lights out\\x85 an eerie silhouette of a human like creature loiters down the hall  you repeatedly blink in an attempt to mould its blurred lines  but the dishevelled contour of the unfathomable spectre remains absolutely motionless  lights on\\x85 nothing there  lights out\\x85 it has   it is moved a couple of inches near you  and your breath starts to come in short gasps  lights on\\x85 a tinge of stinging pain strikes your bloodshot eyes  and sweat covers your petrified face  you hesitatingly move your fingers upon the switch and take an abrupt stop in the middle to wonder what will happen the next time the lights go out  well  let us see  lights out\\x85 perhaps  you should not have been so curious in    swedish filmmaker  david f  sandberg  put out one of the most iconic horror short film experiences that the internet had ever experienced  by that time  all the corners of the virtual realm were awash with the amateurish spine tingling stories  and the emergence of urban legends  such as the slenderman  they galvanised aspiring writers to leave their marks on virtual forums  but a selected few decided to take their projects to a whole new level by transferring them to a wider scope lotta losten  who played the nameless main character in the short film version  enacts a below par reinterpretation of the same scene  which filled our hearts with sheer dread on youtube  this time  she plays a woman who works in a mannequin warehouse  and  while clocking out  happens to have a ghastly encounter with a ghoulish presence  however  she has   he is able to sheer away from a gruesome fate  subsequently  she warns her boss  paul  about what she saw  he does not seem to give much thought to it  but later on  while walking down a dimly lit hall  he comes across a monstrous apparition  which drags him into the darkness  and mauls him to death the story follows the brothers  martin and rebecca  trying to fathom the depression episodes of their mother  sophie  who happens to have an unexplained connection with the same demonic entity  who attacked paul  their stepfather  rebecca is the typical rogue girl who has   who is then telephoned by the school  where her brother studies  to talk about his sleeping in the class  of which he attributes to the same entity which happened to haunt his sister  rebecca feels beholden to become his responsible guardian  inasmuch as her mother is not of sound mind to look after the boy  and that has   that is when the very same monstrosity that traumatised her childhood  decides to lurk in the shadows of her bedroom one more time unfortunately  the adapted version falls short in offering an immersing narrative compared to the original one  the short film is well off for uneasiness  it relates to the blood curdling sensation of going to the kitchen  in the middle of the night  to get a glass of water  and feeling that  at any moment  a gelid hand will sneak up on you  the foundations of the original piece are the imaginary phantasmal beasts  which are masterfully woven due to mere creaks and noises the experience does not establish a favourable pace in order to evoke a heartfelt sympathy towards the characters  the film does not take too long to showcase its premise by walking us through its mechanics  a glowing lamp pops up in the screen signalling its importance in the narrative and it appears that the whole story is used as a mere background for its successful jump scares extravaganza   lights out  did not seem to have inherited the same traces that its predecessor could have bequeathed  instead  it limits itself as a roller coaster filled with jump scares that do not allow the viewer to take in the events  notwithstanding  it does not entirely fail to regale us  the formula can be categorised as hackneyed  but gets its message effortlessly through to us by simply saying  grab a torch and give darkness a wide berth  lights out\\x85 enjoy the ride verdict      lights out really is a great modern horror film  it offers great thrills and also offers wonderful acting  every actor did their job beautifully and the characters they portray are well constructed  they are not just surface level  cardboard cut out characters  the visuals are good  the darkness and the creepy eeriness effect of a lot of scenes work very well  there are some scenes that may even be somewhat hard to watch because of the utter creepiness  diana and the visuals that make her up are done very well and the horror is real here  it has   it is not cheap or cheesily boring  the opening of the film is also very effective in its attempt to be truly scary  this movie is not very gory or overly grotesque either  it has a minimal amount of blood gore  and some violent images  but not a whole whole lot  which it good and a wise decision by the filmmakers  because if a scary movie is too gory or overly disturbing  then it can be distracting from the plot  you want people focused on the plot of the movie and on what has   what is going on  not on the ridiculous amount of gore  lights out receives an     on my scale  a man called paul  billy burke  is working after hours and is murdered by a supernatural entity in the shadow  when his son  the boy martin  gabriel bateman   is frightened by the same creature  he sees his mother sophie  maria bello  talking to an imaginary friend called diana  alicia vela bailey  in the shadow of her room  martin does not sleep anymore during the night but in classroom and his older stepsister rebecca  teresa palmer  that lives alone is summoned by the social assistant  she brings martin home and recalls he own experience with diana years ago when she was young  sophie and her boyfriend bret  alexander dipersia  investigate the connection of sophie with diana and come up to a scary revelation about their past  lights out  is a flawed horror film that startles the viewer  the high quality production has top notch cinematography  associated to a great cast highlighting the wonderful teresa palmer and maria bello  unfortunately the story has many flaws and it is not well explained  for example  why the light burns diana in the end  could it be because it was directed to her   and not along the film   or why sophie s suicide destroys diana  was she creating the entity  why    was sophie having problems with her first and second husband  or is just diana s jealousy  or how it was explained to the police how paul  two police officers and a housewife were mysteriously murdered  the writers could have been more careful with viewers that are not brainless  at least  in  der fluch von darkness falls   a k a   darkness fall    the entity is better explained  but anyway it is worthwhile watching this film  my vote is seven title  brazil    quando as luzes se apagam    when the lights are out   lights out  is quite possibly one of the most visually and mentally scary films in the last two years  the film is yet another in a string of horror movies that uses diseases as allegories for its premise  and this premise alone is genius  lights out is often unnerving and sometimes terrifying  dark in look and tone  without feeling recycled or derivative  the biggest strength of the film is that the story is constructed in a way that the audience is always wondering if something will happen the most genius element of the film is the look of the creature that haunts this movie  diana   diana is an all black figure that lurks in the dark  and kills whoever threatens it  that being said throughout this film the audience has to fear that this character could pop out of any dark space at any given time  at   minutes  not a single second is calm or peaceful  because the mere sight of sight of this creature is unnerving  however  the writers and crew deserve credit for conceiving the idea of the film having a lot of darkness in it we often say lighting is a storytelling device  but in today s films it has   it is become less true the more formulaic films get  in this film lighting is very much a storytelling device  and it is used perfectly  every scene in this film contains  just the right amount of darkness and light  almost as if there are safe areas  and areas that characters should stay away from  and they are often changing  the dark look and tone of this film  create a very unnerving atmosphere  because one of the most common fears is a fear of the dark  and more notably a fear of the unknown  which exists in the dark the film really hit a note with me personally  because i have had nightmares in the past about all dark figures living in the dark  so the film felt that much more personal to me  that being said  the film really does not feel all that derivative of other recent horror films  a few moments  and scenes did feel familiar  diana as a child   but those were few and far between  even those moments that are a little familiar  are constructed in a way that they are still very scary  the film does what the babadook did a couple of years ago  and uses depression as an allegory for the creature in the film  which is turning into a very cool concept  the film is one of the few films within the system that uses lighting to tell the story  and does so in a way that is clever and terrifying at the same time  the film is admittedly dark  and relatively humorless  and not really for children  but that kinda goes without saying  for those horror buffs looking for a good scary movie  this may be your movie  lights out takes some queues from japanese styled ghost stories  so it will be attractive to that audience  it has a strong chill factor but a somewhat average formula  and it could have used fewer back story explanations to make it more mysterious  especially since those elements did not feel original  based on chill factor alone  it ranks higher than dark water  the forest  paranormal activity  the others  the babadook  and the boy  and lower than the ring  ju on   the grudge  and other japanese styled ghost stories  as well as any horror james wan himself directs  comparing it to masterpieces like the exorcist and poltergeist has no value  i would say its chills rank somewhat evenly with the woman in black and it follows  without being as original as the latter the ghost itself is creepy enough  but the overall movie did not have the creative twists that we enjoyed from movies like the boy  the others  the sixth sense  and   cloverfield lane  it also did not have the storytelling chemistry of james wan s own insideous or the conjuring movies i am a fairly difficult person to frighten  i have been seeing horror movies at the theater since the   s  and i am usually only interested in the ones that have a supernatural or fantastical element to them  so i am very critical of them  and the only ones i collect on disc are either fun  tremors   scary  the grudge   or both  an american werewolf in london   i will collect this one ghost stories are done to death  it is very difficult to come out with anything scary that is original  i think lights out could have used the guided hand of a third party master horror writer  mostly revising the back story revelations and using the character relationships to build suspense and mystery surrounding what is going on  then  perhaps working up to a punch line at the end so that suddenly the back  story rushes in on the audience in one moment  with one simple revelation  it is very difficult to think of how that can be done  but other movies have done it  and the payoff is huge  i think lights out tried to do that a little but got confusing in the attempt  but all in all it has   it is a nice little scary movie with a smaller production value but a satisfying ghost  lights out does not break any new ground  nor does it really attempt to    minutes of pg   jump scares and basic horror tropes in the vein of the grudge  not bad for a summer fright fest  but do not expect more as you will not find it here  technically it looked and sounded great  with a notable crazy mom performance from maria bello  if you have seen the director s original short you have basically seen this movie already  however if you are looking for a quick scare without a lot of substance this should do the trick  for a good storyline with stylish direction look elsewhere  as the missed opportunities pile up rather quickly with this one  the short is a fantastic example of a clever and well executed idea  it just works  so good  and i was super excited about the feature  so it hurts to say that the feature is far from the clever short  why  they milk the concept bone dry in a couple of minutes  you get it all in the intro and everything after the title is just a downward spiral with a bunch of desperate attempts to keep it going  i hoped this could be a great feature version of the weeping angles from doctor who  if you have not seen that you should watch the episode  blink  right now  http   www imdb com title    ref  fn al tt   of my favorite horror movies are the original chainsaw massacre  blair witch project and the evil dead  what do they have in common  they leave a lot to your own imagination  you get bits and pieces of explanation but they never give too much  they let you fill in most of the blanks  lights out wants to explain all of it and centers the whole story about that explanation  in that way they miss the thing that made the concept so good  the fear of the dark and the fear of the unknown  when they take that from us we are left with jumpscares and predictable story lines     spoilers    lights out is one of those movie concepts that sounds really interesting on paper  but falls flat on its face and breaks its nose as soon as it starts moving it has   it is a jump scare filled slug that fails to impress  featuring a boring cast with no real personality  illogical decisions to try and make you jump  and a monster that does not even follow her own rules the massive problem is the star of the movie itself  diana  she has   he is an evil woman that follows the mother of two kids  and relies on the mother suffering to survive her self  the problem with diana is that she breaks her own rules all the bloody time  one moment she needs people to open the doors for herself  the next she has   he is teleporting around like she has   he is a god  in the next moment she might disappear when you flash a light at her  or she might decide to stand there and burn while screaming her lungs out diana herself does not seem to have any real goal other than being a jerk  she needs the mother to be depressed or she disappears  supposedly  but then decides to hunt her kids when they are trying to avoid her  which in theory she should be grateful for diana is also about as subtle as a train wreck  whenever she appears the music blats your ears in an attempt to scare you  but when you close your ears  since it has   it is always easy to predict where she will be  and just look at the scene  you realize diana is about as scary as mickey mouse with fangs characters also do the stupidest of things  like walking towards where they know diana might be  instead of staying in a lit area where they are safe  and the excuse  they do not know better  is not valid  since the entire family knows diana is real  and has multiple scars and wounds to show from it in conclusion  lights out is a poorly thought out movie that would have been better off staying as a short film  the only real good thing about the movie is that none of the  living  characters are inhumanly bastards  do not waste your time  this is what horror films should be like   focused on the scares  has really effective jump scares  even a few humor thrown in  and a not complicated story line that is very easy to follow this is very much a very  popcorn horror movie  where it delivers the right scares   thrills  maybe it was a little too short  but that has   that is okay compared to long horror movies that do not really work i found myself jumping shouting screaming a couple of times watching this in the movie theater and i assure you it was not because i just wanted to do it or due to the influence of peer pressure of everyone in the theater also jumping  and it has also impact beyond that  because you had   you would be thinking about this movie when you get home and you have to turn off the lights it has   it is a very entertaining horror film and in my opinion  what horror films should be like  especially pg   horror films    pg   horror films  can indeed be very effective in the right circumstances  those people who are saying this is  only scary  because of the  jump scares  do not understand effective jump scares when they see them so bring your friends along with you and watch this in the cinema and you shall   you will be surprised  its brilliance lies in its simplicity  lights out does not attempt to confuse anyone  nor does it look to introduce a totally original idea  instead  it boldly and unambiguously taunts the audience with the message   you were all afraid of the dark as kids and most of you still are   never has a scary movie villain had such an easy foil—light  literally any kind of light—sun  fluorescent  bright  they each work perfectly well  shine any sort of light in the direction of this movie s monster and she disappears  poof  she has   he is gone and everyone is safe  writing this  i recognize that this does not sound even the tiniest bit scary  yet somehow  as i sat in my well lit house after watching the movie  i felt afraid  a brief telling of the plot  there has   there is a monster demon ghost girl named diana that lives only in darkness because light hurts her  and sometimes she kills people  she haunts other people in the movie who try to not be killed by her and also they try to defeat her  that has   that is really all there is to know  yes  it has   it is a very simple plot  but still an enjoyable one  at least in this instance something about the beautiful simplicity of the scare tactics just worked  nothing confusing  nothing shocking  there were not even very many classic hanging suspense moments interrupted by loud  jolt scares  these we textbook jump scares  a seemingly safe moment with normal amounts of sound that slowly drifts to silence then pow  a jump scare  you may be thinking   this sounds lame  how does this brutally basic approach yields effective scares   great question  my astute and thoughtful reader  I have thought about this question and come up with a few explanations  first  we owe a tremendous credit to the actress who played diana  alicia vela baley   her intimidating posture and sickly contorting and freddy kruegerish flailing arms bring to life a terrifying character  whose mere presence on screen is enough to leave viewers unsettled  there has   there is something about crouching  and vela baley is great at it  seeing a person crouch in a well lit area is comical  but looking at a crouching figure in the shadows  that will make your skin crawl  the other explanation that i will offer is the visceral nature of the scares  much of the movie takes place in the dark and the dark is scary  we are evolutionarily predispositioned to fear the dark  it has   it is a survival instinct  do not argue with me on this  I am right  anyway  th',\n",
       "  'e dimly lit  shadowy settings are the perfect playground for visceral and pure jump scares  director david f  sandberg hits all the right beats in framing and lurking camera movement to maximize this simple and smart approach  so  that has   that is it  if you cannot stand jump scares or scary movies  do not see lights out  honestly  I am not sure why you are even reading this review if you do not like scary movies  if you do like jump scares and scary movies  watch lights out  and maybe buy a couple extra lightbulbs or a nightlight before you do  this movie is great  it immediately engages and then keeps the audience s attention  the story is compact  the acting strong and ending plausible  perhaps the strongest performance is that of marie bello  who plays an emotionally disturbed woman  however  all of the performances are outstanding  the movie succeeds in creating a mood of foreboding as all are engaged in a fight for survival against an unknown malevolent force  the movie avoids the pitfall of becoming just another scary movie with contrivances that inspire laughter  instead  it succeeds in telling a story and building the tension to its inevitable climax  that is the hallmark of excellent story telling and why this movie is worth watching  just saw a screening of it  if you like horror I had   I would say go see it  it is a jump scare movie but there has   there is some depth and story to it  character development was great  actually get to care about them and want to see them make it out  acting was pretty good  f x were good  the only part that i did not like was they did the explanation of the backstory by one character explaining it to another  i always hate when they do that  just seems lazy the audience really got into it with a lot of people jumping and then a lot of giggles at themselves and others for jumping  oh and in our screening the comedic relief of the big guy down front yelling  oh s  t  every time diana jumps out  it reminded me of when i was a young teen and we had   we would get a whole group to go see the newest horror    halloween etc you cannot take it too seriously  just sit back and enjoy it overall I had   I would give it a     which is pretty good for a horror flick  lights out was a film i was looking forward to  described as being one of the best and most well rounded horror films to come out in recent years i was definitely intrigued  so i went to the theatre with high expectations so lights out is a film with a very cool concept that if done right could end up being something very scary and chilling  but  instead we get something much much less that that  this film from beginning to end was so anticlimactic  boring and generic  i will try and keep this review as spoiler free as possible  the beginning scene is extremely anticlimactic  the director does a great job of building some solid tension and some genuine sense of unease with this first sequence but the pay off was such a major let down  a character is pulled laughably into the darkness  unfortunately this is the only scene that built any tension at all  for the entire duration of the rest of the movie there is no tension what so ever  every  scare  is predictable and laughable  characters who know and have known for a long time that you have to stay in the light to escape this ghost foolishly hold their lights in front of them  pointing the light away from them rather than holding the light above their heads  so many scenes involved characters surrounded by darkness  holding a light in front of them and backing into the darkness  so anticlimactic and boring to watch  this ghost has the power to rip someone into the darkness and do away with them immediately   so why does it not do this to these characters that it wants out of the picture  instead it chooses to show up and grab their shoulders  or stand in the doorway or something equally as ridiculous  for one half of the movie the ghost instantly disappears when the light hits it  but in the third act suddenly for no apparent reason at all the light burns her  there was no explaining this is just suddenly happened  the characters have the opportunity to delve into their past and really develop and maybe even have an arc  instead we get generic characters with minimal motivation and a very very vague and uninteresting back story  the exposition in the film is also ridiculous  there is a scene where rebecca walks in and just meets this lady for the first time in her life and within seconds she says something along the lines of  stepfather not my father  my father abandoned me   who says that  who says that within seconds of meeting someone  it has   it is like the director has such difficulty introducing us to these characters and their back stories that he writes them with out any thought or any heart  i will not reveal much about the story but i will just say it is the most generic story line possible  the potential was there to write an interesting mystery but instead the ball was dropped  we get a generic  mom met a girl  the girl died because of some unjust cause and now the girl is back in ghost form  nothing interesting and you see it coming from a mile away  the acting is awful  i could not take anybody in the movie seriously  the interactions between characters all seem so forced and unnatural there really is not anything about the movie that was redeemable  i went into it hoping I had   I would like it  but no  the only thing i could give it as a positive would be the fact that it has   it is well made  but the budget was obviously the reason for that  if somebody gave me millions of dollars to make a movie I am sure it would look and sound just as good it had a pretty good concept but unfortunately the ball was dropped  nothing interesting or even slightly different was done and the film ended up being a stale and boring one     it was not until i checked the credits that i realized this was based off of the short film by david f  sandberg  i knew the lights off lights on shadow figure thing seemed familiar  while i really loved the short film  i do not necessarily agree that it needed the full length treatment  i feel like we see this a lot   capitalize off some popular internet thing that  when extended  loses some of what made it special in the first place  the short film was unsettling and creepy as it was  giving it a back story and more detail made it feel cheapened  I am not a huge fan of  boo   gotcha horror movies  though  i come from a generation that was raised on the original halloween and  for me  that is the apex of subtle  creepy  slow burn etc   everything that makes one get enveloped in a movie  when there are two many jump atchas  it is jarring and does not make for high replay value  for me  anyway   i thought the mental asylum backstory was so played out  i feel like maybe that trope should be burned alive  we get it  although that has   that is kind of how i also feel about kids being creepy  or  troubled    too  there has   there is just so little variation in horror these days  not all bad  though   i feel like the choice of teresa palmer as maria bello  sophie  s character s daughter was a fantastic choice  i not only enjoyed her performance but i feel she looks the part  she looks like a younger version of her  i was looking forward to seeing lights out in the theatre  I am always interested when an amateur director of a promising short is offered the chance to make a feature film out of his neat  little idea  for anyone who has not seen the shortfilm lights out by david f  sandberg on which this movie is based  go check it out  it has   it is on youtube  it has   it is funny and creepy at the same time and develops quite a charme in just   minutes however  i have to say  when it comes to the full lentgh version of the film  it is simply not more than an above average horrorflic that definitely shows a potential in a young director who hopefully hones his skills in his projects  compared to most other horrorfilms of late  lights out is definitely better than works like annabelle  ouija  the woman in black    sinister    insidious     or the other side of the door  but sadly this does not say all too much  those assembly line horrorfilms simply suck  it is also not quite on the same level as   cloverfield lane  the babadook or it follows  let alone the cinematic powerhouses of the last century what i liked about the movie is the cinematography and the building of tension  the camera work is not very dynamic  but the scenes are always crisp and clear  the angles are well chosen  the play with light and shadow is very creative and leads to moments that are tense as well as funny  e g  in the scene where a red neon light is shining in intervals through the window of beccas bedroom and the creature only shows itself when said light is switched off  all the horror scenes are well directed and even the occasionally thrown in jumpscares suit the situations mostly well  it has   it is a constant back and forth between the chilling  tense absence of the creepy creature and the terror that unfolds when it finally shows itself  the horror aspect of lights out definitely works however  the framework that holds everything together is simply underwhelming due to a boring script and a lack of experience when it comes to direct emotionally charged character interaction  the characters in the film are likable  especially beccas boyfriend  who has   who is struggling hard to convince her to open up to him and is very sympathetic in his clumsiness and earnestness  and we spend quite some time to just learn about them  but the movie does not do much with it  especially when you consider that the movie is about a terrifying monster that comes across as scary and brutal in the well realized opening  the rest of the film is simply too harmless  undisturbing and shallow  everything boils down to a very simple family drama without ever delving too deep into the regions of mental disorder or the disruption of family ties upon which the film touches  also  for the most time  everything that the creature does is nothing more than a clawed hand shooting out of the dark and grabbing at one of the protagonists additionally  the creature seems to be quite stupid  it has   it is motivation is   as is revealed about half into the movie   to be left alone  however  when it seeks out becca in her apartment  revealing its presence to her and even scratching its name into the floorboards  it does provoke exactly the opposite  also  the backstory of the creature is delivered in rather lame exposition and is overall pretty messy  the script could have done a way better job at presenting an engaging mystery here so overall  lights out manages to provide short  effective and tense moments of horror and develops at least characters that are likable  that makes it entertaining to watch but overall pretty forgettable  it has   it is never really bad  but also lacks moments that are really memorable  apart from the scene with the car keys  that one was awesome   thus  i enjoyed it  but i probably do not have to see it again anytime soon  alright  i was kinda hyped for this movie  since everybody was like  see this if you are not easily scared  they forgot to add  because you will get a yawn fest  i have to admit the movie looks pretty  it is really pretty  the cast are pretty  the sets are pretty  the light is pretty  the intro is pretty  after the intro  the movie is pretty         dumb and not  horror dumb  kind of way  rather dumb in a  this is plain dumb  way the decisions the characters make  the lame and way too much straight into  your face expositions  the jump scares that made no sense  the lack of character development  it all made me yawn at about     of the movie  and later on was only worse  the dialogues  the music sound effects  the monster  the reveal  the lack of character depth made me wish for them to die  rather the opposite  the ways to fight the monster back were ridiculous  and the ending  the dumbest ending i have seen in a long time christ  this movie made me angry  so promising and yet   ultimate letdown rent it  or not  better not  scariest movie i have ever seen  if you find conjuring funny  that has   that is fine but this movie is in completely different league  it will surely make you scream  go for the movie  there are many jump scare in the movie specially in the second half and you will never turn off the light after watching it  second half is too damn awesome  movie is completely different from the trailer  the story is good  but i am telling you  this movie is scariest one  the second half is full of jump scare  you are gonna surely jump out of your seat  finally the horror genre is at track  wish to see more movies like this  this movie is a perfect treat for horror movies lover like me   lightsout is the one of the best horror movie in the recent time  which is better than     the atmos effect is out standing you know it before that the ghost is going to show up even though you will get that shock  i was like  totatallyfreakedout  wtf ghost scenes are nearly gave me a lot of  heartattack hats off to the director david f  sandberg and editors  michel aller and  kirk m  morribest  screenplay  ericheisserer  gabriel bateman   he did t just act in the movie he lives   martin  in the movie  teresa palmerpalmer   as usual  rocking performance    alexander di persia   this guy deserved lots of applause for a couple of important scenes in the theater    tooscary  stayinlights  morthformoney i went into this knowing that it was rated above average for a horror movie and came out feeling like i am on a totally different page  it contains all the clichés of a typical  low budget horror movie with one dimensional characters  a loose plot  weak acting  glaring stigma towards individuals with mental illness  and more  the fact that it is unable to hit the     mark should have warned me there was little substance and i did not find myself invested in the characters or the unveiling of the truth behind the situation  on a sidenote  there was not much to look forward to with the scariest moments already portrayed in the trailer as well  terribly mediocre  going into this movie i expected much less than what the typical horror movie genre is today in this generation  well i will be damned    i had tickets to go see an early screening of this movie and let me tell you from men to women everyone was tense in the audience  lots of people jumping in their seats and screams as well  this movie hit the spot from the acting which was sub par from the evil entity  i give this movie a   out of    most people should really give it a try it is worth the money for sure  the film is only   minutes which was a downfall but i will take it versus a   hour horror movie that is boring till no end  if the media is calling conjuring   horror then lights out must be in a different horror category because it is def  scary     a film that brings more of the same  with virtually all the clichés of middling horror movies that take over the cinema lately   lights out  does not stand out  the concept is different  but it is not new  the soundtrack  essence a horror film  is weak  all reasonable performances  the script is linear  tries to deepen but do not know how  and the film tries to scare all the time  but can not  and in some scenes starts laughing viewer to about shooting and narrative elements are reasonable  do not get to be bad not  if you are a cliché horror lover  go see this movie  otherwise pass away from the cinema it has   it is another cliché that will fill theaters  but it has nothing to add  lights out was not a bad film  and it has   it is always nice when a horror film comes out that has some scary moments and is only pg    usually i go into pg   horror films with low expectations  which allowed me to enjoy the movie for what it is  a bunch of jump scares  the short film this movie was based off was simple  and effectively scary  by adding so much to the concept  it threw off the pacing  this film tried to be more than what is was  it tried to explore a deeper meaning  touching on mental illness and family problems  think the babadook but not nearly as good   but it only managed to scratch the surface in a pretty shallow and uninteresting way  this was only accentuated by sub par acting from quite a bit of the cast however  the film succeeded in making diana frightening  by not ever showing her real form for much time outside of the shadows  she managed to be pretty horrifying  definitely a creature to inspire nightmares when you turn out the lights overall it was fun to go see in a theater filled with jumpy teenagers  but not really worth a second watch  a gen z update to kathryn bigelow s   cult classic  this remake is essentially an episode of fast and furious in which the vehicular exploits have been replaced with an assortment of extreme sports sequences  constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work  the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive  a high octane wing suit gliding scene and the tension building rock climbing finale topping the list  yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level  stemming from kurt wimmer s truly awful screenplay  every second not spent traversing a mountainside  soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and or yawn inducing  wimmer s dialogue attempts to be philosophical and zen like  but with clichéd stinkers like  the only law is gravity  and  everyone dies  it has   it is just a matter of how   it has   it is nothing short of unintentionally hilarious  replacing the eternally cool patrick swayze was always going to be tough  however edgar ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco warrior bohdi  the same cannot be said for low budget chris hemsworth hunk luke bracey though  who is so wooden as johnny utah he makes keanu reeves look like daniel day lewis  this modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences  yet they are not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller  if you like those   or   minute gopro or red bull videos of people doing extreme sports then you will certainly like most of the movie as a lot of it is exactly that   and to be sure  those moments were pretty cool to watch and very well done  unfortunately  in between all of those moments is a pretty boring plot line with characters that you never really care about if you like mindless action  nothing wrong with that  then you will probably like this movie   although most of the  action  is extreme sports  not really guns apparently i have to write at least ten lines of text  but honestly there is not much more to say about the movie  beware people  this is an early review  being a member of a media group i caught an early screening at the amc  i was not required to sign an nda point break is a bafflingly unsolicited remake of the   cult classic of the same name  it is directed by ericson core  a good filmmaker who directed the   invincible  a film which is criminally underrated  when i found out that point break was being remade i shuddered in fear  but i when i learned that core was directing the film  i immediately changed my tune  as i hold invincible in such high regard  as it truly is an under appreciated film for the ages point break   is grotesque  i am not inherently adverse to remakes and reboots  and i am not at all a purist  i am perfectly fine with rebooting material and straying from source material if it serves the story well  what had happened here is that the studio has produced a garden variety action movie and slapped a name on it purely for the sake of brand recognition the film exceeds expectations in the sense that this a slickly produced action film with a completely rad soundtrack  the camera work  framing and editing leave everything on the proverbial field  there is not anything new going on here  but it has   it is produced in a professional manner and the action scenes are handled with extreme care and along comes the story  instead of our group of guys pulling bank jobs to fund adrenaline junkie lifestyles  the action men of   are se',\n",
       "  'lf aware crusaders  too cool for school  hipsters on a self imposed mission from god  every character in this film is ball  kickingly annoying  the problem is that not one of the main characters are in possession of a redeemable quality and their motivations are completely nonsensical  they are all essentially unknowingly pseudo intellectuals if this movie had been titles virtually anything else i may have given it a   or   out of    rather than a three  though the unnecessarily and intentionally sanitized   vibe completely disrupts any potential the film may have had in the first place it has   it is not good  it stinks no sir  i do not like it  i was enthusiastically exuberant about returning to what I have known as a cult classic  the original  point break   this reboot  is full of slick stunts and visuals  but the story  or lack thereof  makes this taste like pablum  i very seriously doubt that after two hours from getting out of the theater watching this  that anybody would even remember the name s of the central characters in this film  why  because the film maker neglected to give us a story where the characters are expounded and fleshed out beyond the   minutes for any resolute back story on any of them  i appreciate the stunts and stunt people for their quality work involved  but stunts do not make a movie  a good story  with quality characters that are inter meshed with emotions and plots that pull the viewer into the characters  world is what makes a memorable film  I shall   I will stick with the original  point break   this is my first review on imdb  i felt compelled to write this in protest to what i believe is the worst movie i have ever seen  it has   it is so bad that i will be watching out for future films by the directors  actors and writers to avoid all their future efforts  the original is a bit cheesy but it has   it is enjoyable  this is all cheese  I am amazed that it was allowed to be put out to the cinema in its form  nobody but the stunt team can get credit here  similar stunts can be seen in a more realistic form by a simple you tube search  please do not watch this  the lines in this movie are so bad you would laugh if you were not so angry  i cannot believe it obtained a rating of   on imdb    at best  imagine the intense stunts from energy drink commercial or youtube extreme sport montage while music from mad max blares on background  this is where the second coming of point break truly excels  when it hits just the right velocity  it has   it is bloody breathtaking  unfortunately  the narrative is not only poor  it nearly sabotages the movie like a broken parachute story revolves around utah  luke bracey   an fbi trainee as he investigates a series of heists and their connection to a group of athletes led by bodhi  édgar ramírez   as one might expect  it follows the same trail that keanu reeves and patrick swayze has placed  the new leads do what they can  although it has   it is better to watch this without comparing  because it certainly does not have the same caliber of star or chemistry the plot then dives head first into uncharted territory  it has   it is littered with so much  save the planet  preachy acts as the writing struggles to place fbi agent in the hippie nirvana angle  the motivation is just a mess of random vague one liners  even the on screen characters are perplexed by it  there has   there is a romance subplot  but this is mainly to show the attractive teresa palmer as eye candy for several short scenes the movie is actually better when they just show the crazy sequences instead of forcing its lackluster story  it has plethora of impressive feats  from high heaven wingsuit flying  the climb on hazardous urban streets and natural cliffs  to the surfing of gigantic waves  this is the level of stunt choreography xxx and fast and furious wish they had when camera pans into the right angle and lighting  as the sounds is muffled by throbbing tune of the fast music  point break reaches the zenith  it has   it is miles beyond what typical action flick could offer  but sadly it has   it is repeatedly interrupted by the shoddy story  which feels like an excuse to fly across the globe to do random cool tricks if viewed only on the grand mix of cinematography and choreography  point break is exquisite  this would have been a great documentary of extreme sport  however  as action movie  the story is so pretentious  it simply serves as speed bump to hamper the thrill  i sincerely hope the original point break is much different than this lifeless  hippy dippy  overblown mountain dew commercial  I have never seen the original movie  so i have no bias towards it  based on the movie s own merit has   it is  the point break remake is laughably awful  in point break  a rookie fbi agent tracks down a group of extreme athletes who go around the world carrying out crimes in unusual and life threatening ways  they plan to do a series of near  impossible stunts called the ozaki   in hopes of reaching spiritual enlightenment  at least  that was the plot for about ten minutes before the movie devolves into a series of party scenes and surprisingly dull extreme sports clips that could have been easily viewed on youtube  all set to irritating club music  it takes a special director to make base jumping and cliff diving this boring  ericson core builds as little suspense as possible in his action set pieces and instead films admittedly well shot highlights reels for the action scenes  any sort of suspense conjured up is because of the great cinematography because the characters are so flat and annoying that you almost wish they would get killed off  everyone in this movie acts stoned out of their mind  all they do is spit faux  philosophical nonsense which gets tiring after the first twenty minutes  it gets laughable towards the end of the movie with lines like  ideas are strong  but not as strong as a whaling ship   and no amount of context will make that line any less ridiculous  the unbearable dialog  muddled plot and dull characters makes this point break remake utterly pointless  if you are not a fan of remakes  this will make you reach your breaking point  i just saw the first projection at chiang mai thailand  this is one of the most horrible movies i have ever seen  please do not waste your money  the story makes no sense  the characters are stiff like frozen cucumbers  the purpose and motivations are completely ridiculous  this is a disgrace of a movie  it is as if the director wanted to create the horrible anti point break  oh my god  oh my buddha  wasted life  there is no logic  the characters are half dimensional  the star is beyond ridiculous and annoying  the girl is on drugs  the pace is awful they jump from scene to scene like monkeys jump from tree to tree  the director clearly had no vision  i do not know what to say other than stay away  stay away  the original point break was mostly known for its memorable bromance between utah and bodhi and some of its greatest action scenes ever put to film  either way  this remake does not bring enough justice to the cult classic  its new approach  instead of a simple undercover cop thriller  is now a globe trotting adventure featuring daredevils who are pulling off a grand stunt show  though the stunts are impressive at times  it still pales in comparison with the original  the characters are bland  the plot makes no sense and every moment it tries to replicate with the original is just painfully forced for the sake of what they believe it has   it is called  fan service   therefore  there is not much reason for point break     to exist so point break is now about the stunts  but just like most action movies today  it also had to strip away personality  so whenever we see the cops  and even the daredevils  interact  it has   it is just not so entertaining  one of the charms of the original  while it had some great action sequences  even the characters are interesting to watch  even if it has   it is trifle  it has   it is still worth spending your time  now  it somehow becomes uninteresting filler  especially the love interest  remember when utah had to lie about his backstory to earn her trust  well  now they just easily hook up and nothing else  until some twist happens or something like that  utah and bodhi are not   am not as engaging  either  they are mostly spewing exposition  while bodhi is basically acting like a parody of someone from a new age religion  their intention of becoming robin hoods is kind of vague as well  but i guess no one thinks it actually matters what has   what is really worth groaning is when it has   it is really trying to replicate the original  not by heart or personality  but by scene  they did the ex  presidents  even though one of them is wearing an obama mask despite of taking place in    but they only did it once  probably because there is not much room for this fan service  also the iconic scene involving utah shooting up the air  which apparently hot fuzz did it better  and the epilogue is horrendously shoehorned  like it has   it is nothing more than a tip off the hat  because    it has   it is not point break without it  i guess however  there are some things to at least like in this film  the action is kind of stunning  the fact that they are visually more realistic to look at than most cg fest that blockbusters tend to feed us  except for the epilogue which is too obvious   maybe the best among them is the rock climbing sequence where it goes from wide shots to dirty hand shots of seeing how much they had   they would grip  luke bracey is not quite bad as an action hero  but he seriously needs a better material than this  edgar ramirez is probably just stuck with a blandly written bodhi and really stays stick in the mud with whatever he says about nature  ray winstone  though a good actor  is just not the memorably delightful papas that gary busey established  and the movie would not be any different if teresa palmer s role was written off and point break     is just another needless remake  there are ideas that could have been utilized more  but it has   it is too burdened by both action movie clichés and the fact that it is being point break  it has   it is not a good undercover cop thriller  nor a good bromantic film  and you better off watching an actual stunt show  which at least does not make you get through to its drab expositions and the fact that it has   it is more real and not embellished by any special effects  then again  the effects are not   am not bad  but that has   that is not the point  you may give it credit for heightening something from the original  but it does not do that well either  the fact how unnatural the homages are made for this remake makes it even more frustrating to watch  this movie really is unbelievably terrible  it has   it is basically a bunch of extreme sport stunt shots glued together with nonsensical storyline  bad acting and awful script it has   it is one of those movies that has   that is so bad they cannot even keep basic details straight  such as they drive off a boat at night time for a swim  but it has   it is clearly daytime once they get underwater there are some scenes that have literally no bearing on the story at all   such as the scene at the pier when the fbi uk guy is randomly pulling a boat out of the water the time line of just about every event makes no sense at all the characters have nothing at all about them  they all seems to merge into one hipster bearded blob on the screen and the only way i managed to tell them apart was from their color coded outfits  i am a huge fan of the original point break made in   and now i have seen the   reboot and boy this is one of the worst films of the year and one of the worst reboots ever  the premise of the film sees a young up and coming fbi agent looking to infiltrate a gang of extreme athletes who may also be criminals  luke bracey plays johnny utah in this film and this is potentially one of the most stoic characters of the year and you will not care about him at all  his character is just so uninteresting that it really kills every scene that he is involved in  edgar ramirez plays bowdie in this film and just like bracey he is very stoic and is not an interesting character like his previous incarnation  he is just your generic bad guy that does not have any of the depth to him that you want him too  also their chemistry together just does not work and you just really do not buy it at all  the rest of bowdies crew were just as boring as he was and you will not care about there relationships with utah as the film develops  the only performances i liked were ray winstone and utah s police captain who i thought were both decent additions but they are not   am not given enough to do in this film for you to really care  the story is completely non existent  it is less compelling because the characters and their relationships are so dull and unbelievable that you will not care about anybody or anything in the film  the script has absolutely no depth to it and none of the dialogue was gripping in anyway  the style had some really cool extreme sports that are really well filmed but i do not need to watch this film to watch to watch good extreme sports so it needs to do more an the film just does not do anything more  overall this film is definitely not worth a watch and go and watch the original point break because it is so good  let us put aside the asinine logic that went into the decision to remake point break to begin with  let us just focus for a moment on whether or not they produced a good movie  regardless of whether it was an original idea or not  when we do that i think most of us can agree they failed miserably  this is a boring  unengaging movie in every way  the two leads are lacking in any charisma or appeal  they are both just so dull and lifeless i cannot begin to understand how they were cast in an action movie  let alone a remake of a superior action movie with two leads that played well off each other  but these two being so boring fits the tone of the film  one of the more unexciting excuses for an action movie I have ever seen  the original point break was a fun movie  this thing is dire and seems to believe it has a message  which makes it even worse  it has   it is really just a lackluster movie all around  i guess the one positive it has over the original is that teresa palmer is nice to look at and the original movie just had lori petty  point break marks another blockbuster fizzer from warner bros   who after several flops is now in desperate need of a major hit  this is a useless  money grabbing exercise that rides the name of an already overrated cult film as an excuse to stage pointless stunts  I shall   I will say this once  do not waste your money on this film  if you are a fan of the original point break by kathryn bigelow  the film where patrick swayze played a bank robbing surfer who took keanu  i am an fbi agent  reeves under his wing  watch that film again  if you are in the mood for crazy stunts and set pieces  open youtube and watch some extreme sports videos on there  these are comparatively sound alternatives to this dreck  courtesy of director ericson core who has made his first film since    it might take another nine years and extensive therapy to overcome this stain  the film is so bad and amateurishly composed that it appears someone first listed off a series of extreme stunts and told core and screenwriter kurt wimmer  salt  to write the movie around them no matter how jarring or ill fitting they may seem  if you are still wondering  the stunts do not work on their own because the script s lousiness makes them boring since there has   there is no investment in the one  dimensional characters and the weak performances of the actors no thought went into planning this narrative  it starts with two motocross riders jumping between rock faces  one of them is utah  australian actor luke bracey   who watches as his friend falls to his death  the film forwards seven years to when utah has joined the fbi and is under the watch of instructor hall  delroy lindo   who doubts utah s commitment and calls him son a lot  since utah was once a motocross rider in the extreme sports circle  he magically has the background information about the activity of the dangerous gang of extreme sports criminals hall is chasing  it has   it is mega stupid and as contrived as the stunts themselves  the gang  best described as a hodgepodge of philosophers  hippies  extremists and mountain dew sports stars  is performing a ritual called the osaki    the osaki   involves eight different extreme sports trials  some of which are criminal activities but others are plain stunts including surfing and mountain climbing  the transition between these set pieces is embarrassing  when utah bombs out in an early surfing attempt  the gang saves him from drowning by bringing him onto their boat  he has   he is recognised as a famous motocross rider from all those years ago but everyone  at least at this point  is oblivious that this not exactly inconspicuous surfer dude has been training as a cop and is allowed to freely explore the boat of the gang leader bodhi  joy s édgar ramírez   the other members of the gang  including teresa palmer as a brief love interest  barely register at all so you will not give two hoots about them and they are not   am not even smart enough to background check utah before initiating him  more criminal than the stunts is how ray winston as utah s partner pappas  a potentially good replacement for gary busey s comic relief character  is inconsequential through much of the film except when questioning if utah is overly enjoying the gang life  but since we do not care about the other gang members  what has   what is the point in blurring the two lines of the law does every blockbuster have to be self serious now because it worked so well in the nolan batman films  whereas bigelow s film meshed action and comedy  this remake does not have a funny side at all  instead  bodhi s long  boring monologues about giving back to the earth  what   are serious delusions this film has about becoming meaningful  but even watching the film solely for the stunts is futile  the film s marketing has emphasised how the stunts are performed by actual stuntmen as opposed to employing special effects  but given the stunts often have nothing to do with the gang s criminal activities  like the surfing  gliding and snowboarding sequences  we are watching a stunt showcase that has   that is completely aloof from the plot  similarly  the apparent realism of the stunts is malarkey since some are about as plausible as a looney tune s cartoon  driving down mountain slopes ahead of an avalanche  through a dense forest on bikes and climbing mountains with just his bare hands will make you think that the fbi has really intensified its training or utah has spent a lot of time with the avengers  the only good things about the film are its brief reference to the bank robber masks of the original and that this boring pile falls under the two hour mark  it has   it is a small victory for anyone who is foolish enough to pay money to see it  i lied and will reiterate  do not pay money to see this because you are only encouraging movies like this with boring action and such carelessness towards the story  it has   it is a black eye to the fans of the original who might have given this disaster a chance  the original was a great movie with classic actors  sure it has   it is dated today  but still carries it has   it is own weight  this movie while containing some visually stunning cinematography  some how manages to just drag and drag  as others have commented it comes of like a commercial  the special affects do not seem that special  it has   it is like you are watching a commercial with snowboarding and sky diving designed to sell redbull  while i should be in awe at what they are doing on screen  i find myself yawning and wondering when is it all just going to end  there is no real tension building  no sense of fear that utah will be discovered  unlike the original  where his cover was about to be blown with each scene  i highly recommend passing on this one  it has   it is a borefest ',\n",
       "  ' point break  the   remake  is the single worse remake in the history of remakes  the original point break was a solid b rated movie making this remake at best an f  i mean I have seen a lot of remakes and this is the worst movie I have ever seen  in fact i honestly felt relieved when the credits started rolling  its funny because they want ten lines just to leave a review  while i could see this working on the average movie this does not not work for point break      the movie is so bad there has   there is few words that can express this  i feel like a teacher is wanting me to write something positive about the end of the world  there is nothing positive about it or this movie  on the plus side I have drug this on to the ten required lines and i can put the movie behind me and pretend i did not waste part of my life watching it  its too late for me  but please save yourself and do not watch this movie  sometimes mere words cannot describe something adequately  and in the case of   s utterly pointless and mind dumbing daft point break remake there are quite literally no words i can summon from the shelves of my undoubtedly mediocre storage system of the english language to pinpoint just how idiotic  stupid and unintentionally hilarious this film is making kathryn bigalow s well liked   original seem like a work of shakespeare  ericson core s update of the relatively simple story of fun loving fbi agent johnny utah infiltrating a group of extreme sports enthusiasts that happen to be criminals is here turned into some type of  giving back to nature  eco conscious athletes that just happen to like messing with the rich corporations ruining mother nature  do not even try to understand the osaki   that keeps popping up here  and johnny utah is turned into a clearly australian  motocross riding  badly tattooed  seriously how many tattooed people can be in one movie   agent that gets to to be involved in one of the most hilarious on screen deaths in some time  in the film s opening   minutes   and somehow possesses even less charisma than keanu reeves  yes  the unthinkable has occurred   but if you think lame motocross related deaths and dodgy eco warriors are the worst of this films problems  then think again director core and his team seemingly sat down at a table and in the space of   or so minutes designed a serious of supposedly breathtaking stunts that span the globe and while they look great in a location sense  the actual transpiring of events are so downright unbelievable that any sense of fun or excitement is taken away by the fact it has   it is just too daft to care from downhill snowboarding  random unnecessarily dangerous rock climbing  perfectly used wing suit fly byes  an exploding rock strewn mountain face and perhaps worst of all  a reimaging of the wave clad finale of the original  point break seems intent on becoming some type of hybrid of fast and the furious but forgets to make sure that the occurrences happening here are indeed fun and frenetic  rather than overdone and frequently unengaging at the end of the day one could go on and one about the many failures of point break but none of it comes as a surprise  as from the moment this remake was announced and then from the very first glimpses of the films atrocious trailer no one expected this waste of    million dollars plus to be anything more than a disposable piece of hollywood trash  with no heart  no soul and with a bunch of uninvolving characters  this film is a waste of time that gets a bonus mark for its intrigue factor as a solidified sunken ship  it has   it is just a shame it took down two up and coming australian actors in the form of luke bracey and teresa palmer with it   mink blanket out of    point break  is what  crusty demons  ought to be  unfortunately  it is not what  point break  ought to be  in fairness  the extreme sports scenes are pretty awesome  the cinematography is crystal clear and the exotic locations are picturesque  as an extreme sports video  it excels  as an action movie or caper  it is less impressive  the greatest problem is that none of the characters are particularly likable or charismatic  personally  i think one major problem is the horrendous tattoos that most of the central characters sport over much of their bodies  having worked as a photographer and cinematographer  i am no fan of tattoos  to me  they suggest low class  criminal background  lack of self respect and many other negative character traits  there are some tattoos that are inoffensive  even impressive – but not in this movie  when i see these tattoos  my first reaction is that i have never been that drunk or that stupid or uncultured  in the original  bodhi s crew had goals and motives that made sense  here  we have a group of athletes with improbable skills  all of whom share an exotic philosophy and a disdain for profit  the surf nazi red herrings are gone  as is utah s need to acquire skills in order to join the group  the whole utah bodhi bromance seems less credible and less compelling  the antagonists are cast as eco warriors  however  somehow it does not make them sympathetic  they are financed by an eccentric multi billionaire  which seems more contrived than organic  at one point  the fbi had very strict standards for its agents  they were expected to dress and conduct themselves in conformance with relatively conservative standards  the notion that the fbi would accept a long haired  extensively tattooed candidate stretches credulity to the limits  as does much of the rest of the film  however  as a direct to video extreme sports video  it would be quite impressive  when you go to the cinema to see an action movie  usually you do not expect something really engaging  most of such productions do not appear as very original nor extraordinary  although  from time to time  we can also find some surprising scores  wchich rebuild our ruined fate in greedy hollywood producers  they go down into our memory  many times  we want to re watch them again  again and again one more time  one of such movies is kathryn bigelow s \\x84point break  from    unfortunately  same words cannot be said about the core s newest \\x84point break  by ericson core is such a schematic and predictable  as every movie created only for visual effects  wchich have been so important for screenwriters  however  the plot seems to be only a minor supplement  who cares  right  so  what do we get here  a threadbare story  wchich tries to stole as much as it has   it is possible from the original  young fbi agent  with embarrassing past  must infiltrate the mysterious organization suspected of many crimes  committed with the help of their amazing sport skills  do you fill familiar with this description  by replacing some words  you could easily come with a conclusion that many action movies are the same  for example \\x84the fast and the furious  and also bigelow s \\x84point break   thanks to the forceful action sequence pictures and technics how they were taken  we may partly forget about mediocre plot  it looks like  core has not known about that  and he probably still does not  because of that  his \\x84point break  is more condensed around crass plot  rather than around extreme sports such things like crazy and dangerous stunts on surfboards and snowboards  motocross rides and jumps from planes have been reduced to minimum  these are a few scenes  wchich have turned out really all right  it should not be a big surprise  because core was a director of photography at such productions as \\x84the fast and the furious  and   s \\x84daredevil   what gave him a necessary experience in this field  although  it does not mean  that he should have neglected all the other features of the movie like good plot or characters  all of these features are only the caricatures of their archetypes from    without any natures  starred by the stiff actors  they look more like the sect of insane ecologists  rather than a division of athletes new version of \\x84point break  ignores every kind of basic elements of good movie  well written plot  interesting characters and most of all a dynamic action  it has   it is one of the worst kind of productions  wchich creators hopped that  a few good action scenes would build up the whole film  unfortunately  they were mistaken  it does not work like this  i watched this movie as an inmate at the metropolitan detention center in los angeles  i am in love with this movie  a lot of people do not appreciate it  but it is one of the few movies in the world that tries to capture the feeling of being fearless  it succeeds on multiple fronts for me  and the cinematography and timing is superb  you get to go places that you probably will never go in your life time  i think people who are used to sitting on their couches and critiquing movies are making the reviews  you should not listen to them  this movie is a must see  an experience of things few people will ever do in their lifetime  and yet    there are people doing them what does it feel like to be truly free  it requires not only the external circumstance of being able to do  what you want  to do  it requires physical fitness  stamina  and your own inner choice to be free  regardless of the constraints of society  doing what you believe and choose against all odds  taking the consequences for your actions  and then to know what it is to live without fear  fearless how many fearless people are reviewing this movie  there are few in the world  my friend  and i am one of them  this movie resonates with me for that reason  point break was rebooted in    it was called the fast and the furious where the surfing was replaced by street car racing this remake sees extreme sports athlete johnny utah  luke bracey  who after losing a friend when a motocross stunt goes wrong goes on to become a fbi agent some years later  his boss hall  delroy lindo  sends him to investigate a series of elaborate heists from a gang who behave like robin hood robbers utah believes that the group are taking part in the ozaki    eight spiritually extreme sport challenges that coincide with the daring robberies  utah infiltrates the gang which is led by bodhi  édgar ramírez  in its own right the film starts brightly enough with plenty of cgi enhanced action but later on the film actually comes to a stop in the non action sequences when the characters just talk  the film then becomes boring and after a while even the action scenes just get duller  the colour grading is awful making the film look cheap despite the international locations the original point break directed by kathryn bigelow  who would go on to become the first female oscar winning director found a zeitgeist of generation x sports action thriller with well staged action sequences  although not the greatest actors around  bigelow got charismatic turns from keanu reeves and patrick swayze and sturdy support from gary busey as reeves fbi boss the remake lacks all of this even though it tried to go on a new direction  i tried to give it a break and approached it with an open mind but alas it is a poor film  the actors and director of this re make of a classic action film must have gone home after making it singing dierks bentley s song  what was i thinking      it is a huge disappointment to anyone who is a fan of the original but like most classic movie re makes  the entire team hired to make this flick completely screwed it up  too much to complain about  and i am usually very forgiving   but this movie just plain sucked  I am glad patrick swayze was not alive to see this pos re make for one  the plot does not even come close to the original   just a few sad  lame ass attempts to link it to the original classic   film in order to call the movie by the same name  such as stealing and inserting scenes like    re using all the main character s names   johnny shooting into the sky when he fails to kill bodhi   bodhi escaping and having to die by a monster wave at the end ray winstone s talent is completely wasted playing pappas  and is probably embarrassed his name is now associated with this mess     there is so many more example of this it is ridiculous so other than calling this flick by the same name of the original classic  and inserting these stolen scenes and names from the original  the movie is something  but it is not point break in the end  it has   it is just an excuse for some self serving  over rated  uber tattooed actors to get a woody playing extreme sport idiots  and some adrenaline junky film makers to get their rocks off filming stupid stunts in exotic locations if your an extreme sports fanatic and do not give a crap about plots  themes  or just a decent action flick  then grab your favorite power bar and energy drink and watch it while downing your steroids but is you are a true fan of the original swayze reeves   classic point break  and were hoping this might be even half the movie the original  you will very  very disappointed the studio execs should have just called this mess no point or give me a break  because there is absolutely no point in watching this piece of crap excuse for a film  this movie is not boring at all and it has   it is full of well done action sequences and it has   it is absolutely worth watching fortunately  I am an extreme sports enthusiast n i love rock climbing n mountain biking  it has the most spectacular visuals of surfing  snowboarding  rock climbing  wing suiting  bike stunts  etc  the director erickson core himself did the cinematography  hes an amateur director but veteran cinematographer  no wonder the film has exceptional cinematography with setting like surfing in the middle of the ocean  angel falls and the alps  the movie has remarkable camera work  the film was able to capture every crucial move with acute depth  i was not expecting oscar worthy performances  edgar ramírez got a strong screen presence n he did a good job  it delivered what i expected  its my kinda action flick  i hate those super hero films  except nolan s batman trilogy  well story wise this is just a mediocre movie  but the stunts and scenery make the   hour and   minutes worth the watch for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing  i know and understand what goes through the minds of extreme sports enthusiasts and why they do it  u cannot call it a remake of the original classic  it has   it is jus inspired by the original  obviously this heap of garbage of a movie was an attempt at a money grab on the name of a mildly successful well known point break movie    off  like the original the acting was pretty horrible     unlike the original the screen play was awful  things are just pieced together  no real story line of any realistic or logical conclusions  they really tried way to hard in this movie and it flopped  you need more than some extreme sport scenes to make a movie cool  this movie lacked any sort of real character development  any interest to pull the viewer in other than some nicely shot scenes  it has   it is mostly hollywood drivel  it has   it is a shame they wasted such a huge budget on this movie  although I am sure the extreme athletes who performed the stunts appreciated the pay check from it  i would skip this movie  go watch the original it has   it is better written  better acted  that has   that is saying a lot  and a more interesting movie  so many terrible reviews  why such negativity  I have seen this film   times and counting  it has   it is so beautiful  it has   it is cinematic poetry  point break is a cautionary tale because the eco warriors rebellion only leads to destruction of others and self  it has   it is the paradox of humankind   good and wicked all in one  please watch with an open mind  also  i find the extreme sports nature sequences breathtaking and beautiful and full of high energy action  there are also some inspiring ideals along the way   the break point  the point where fear becomes master and you the slave     i understand core s approach and kurt wimmer s screen writing logic  a story of friendship with a crazy philosophical twist and rebellion turned into criminal  the natural wonders are fantastic  huge surf waves  alps  and angel falls  yes I am biased    I am from venezuela  and i think edgard ramirez did a spectacular job with his character and angel falls are magnificent  luke bracey as johnny utah is heartfelt and charismatic  roach  chowder  grommet  pappas  and samsara were great too  all straightforward and minimal dialogue  did you know that the climbing of auyantepui was real  the line and bolts were digitized out  but it was and experience of a lifetime for these climbers  chris sharma  peter croft  and dany andrada were the stunt doubles  the behind the scenes video is astounding  one big mistake  to have marketed this movie as a remake of point break    it has   it is inspired by it but another story  and yes  there are problems with the plot and character development  but that has   that is because the focus is on the visual story more than dialogue  another major problem is that the writing and the dialogue lines are too abstract and metaphoric and ambiguous  it has   it is not clear at times what bodhi means or what johnny utah wants  i think i got it and i enjoyed the film  but i can see how it can be confusing to audiences  teresa palmer s lines too are full of philosophical ideas that sound abstract as well  in this version  bodhi is a protégé of osaki  a fictionalized eco warrior with the idea of saving earth by performing   ordeals  this is the fiction   but osaki was killed by a whaling ship when he was  giving back     later  bodhi follows osaki s steps  but he has taken the wrong path  bohdi wants to accomplish his   ordeals to become one with the earth and give back through criminal sabotage acts  however  there has   there is good in bodhi  for he saves utah s life for some unknown compassionate reason      perhaps osaki saved bodhi s life once just like in utah s situation  it would have been great to see the setup story for bodhi as well  yet  bodhi is determined and he does not care he is killing people and destroying assets when he  gives back to earth  without the crime  these guys would be extreme sports crusaders for mother earth s wonders  which would be a whole different story   perhaps I shall   I will write a new point break screenplay inspired by this version of point break  I am a screen writing student   then we have johnny utah  a former extreme sports turned fbi agent  but we do not learn why he specifically joins the fbi  the film would have benefited from additional minutes to set up the characters better and explore their deeper emotional motives  that has   that is what has   what is lacking  utah goes undercover to find out why these extreme athletes are committing crimes  only to get too involved to be able to stop them  part of utah relishes in the chaos and he enters into a conflict with himself  utah however  is the perfect agent to pursue the extreme sports criminals  but his longing for the sport and his gratitude to bodhi are stronger than his fbi mission  and worse yet for the mission  utah has a soft heart and bodhi knows that  utah owes him his life  utah is in a great dilemma   apprehend and kill the very person that saved his life in the end  the power of gratitude and kindness prevails in utah  and he gets back his passion for life  and the bad guys find their fate   enjoy  best wishes  based on the motion picture point break      well yeah  by name and character names  every time i heard names like bodhi on utah i wanted to hurl  why was this movie made  it has   it is got a lot of action  but everyone who has seen original point break is disgusted by this movie  the group who was robbing banks in the original   the dead presidents  are eco warriors in the new movie  freeing  money instead of robbing it  characters utah and bodhi never bond like in the original movie and it makes the whole experience shallow and meaningless  the girl utah falls in the original  is an mentor and a teacher to utah  and in the new movie she is just a junkie  point break   should have been a movie called adrenaline rush with different character names  it would have been better picture with names like jim and bob than bodhi and utah do not make remakes that make no sens']]"

       "['am i the only one who felt that way do not get me wrong  this series is really entertaining and witty  but it just felt like the intro to the story itself binge watching is done easily and quickly with seven   minutes episodes on average which just felt like   at the most or a   minutes movie at the end i just asked myself  why they did not go on so that the story gets told   could not they finish in time  that has   that is the only reason  i just gave it   stars  now we have to wait up to a year for the continuation everything else was really good  great show for someone who has grown up with stephen king stories  carrie and breakfast club  building up the characters takes time  and i see that some other viewers think it is too slow   but i like the story been build up from layer to layer  nice start for an interesting story    and great work from young stars  bingeworthy perfect length   episodes   strong performances   with a cliffhanger which makes me want season   right now   ive watched this in one sitting  it just grabs you and sophia lillis is just mesmerazing imo  loved every minute of this show and dying to see if second season will be made    i am not okey with this  because i am desperately waiting for the second season  i found the show entertaining and fun  however    minute episodes   with a total runtime of just over   hours  with a little more editing it may have just been a better movie  i do not see the point of   different   minute episodes  i hope there is a season   but i hope they add a little more substance  from the start you know exactly how it ends  this takes nothing away from the series at all  there has   there is enough going on to keep you interested from start to finish and the length and pacing is absolutely spot on it touches on all the usual high school phase issues and deals with them in the right way as not to offend anyone but more to add comfort to anyone that goes through these problems as a youngster   minus the super hero stuff    as the title says it has   it is not original we have seen all aspects of this type of series before  for me it was a bit like watching the end of the fucking world  sex education with some super hero twist  what more can you want loved it  the only way to watch is in one sitting  look forward to more  i watched all   episodes in one sitting and really liked it  the overall pacing and the writing was what in my opinion made it work  the actors were all great too and i especially thought that wyatt oleffs performance as stanley barber was amazing the ending was also brilliant i am looking forward to season   i am not ok with this hit has   it is hard but thanks to sophia lilies electrifying performance with each episode passing you shall   you will demand for more  this show was a mix of cliché and originality  on one hand you have interesting plots for episodes  crazy situations  and twists and turns  and I am the other you have predictable plots and writing  the acting was great  they made a smart move by getting actors that have worked on projects previously  and wyatt olef is perfect for his role  i enjoyed sofia s performance as well  she really sold me on her character and her ability to change from being an angry or rude character to a charming and like able one is extremely impressive  i also loved sofia bryant  she was great for her role  all the acting was amazing so props to the casting director  one of my main complaints is the inconsistency with the episodes  some of the  were great  some were okay  and some i did not like very much  this would not be a problem if there were more episodes  but considering there are only   it was not convenient  the series does not drag along and the music is amazing  it perfectly fits the mood  i do feel like the last episode was the best one  and it made me feel like the story had just begun  that has   that is another big problem  i felt like the first   episodes were all leading up to the real show  one good thing to come from this is that it made me want more from the show  the potential really shines through I am the last episode and we get to see what the writers and directors can really do and i would have liked to see that more extreme tone through the season  i was suspecting something was going to happen but the scene really did leave me in shock  it was amazing  i want more of that in the show  my only advice for the writing team is do your research  look at what other netflix shows are doing and do not do that  that is the only way you are getting noticed  break the cliché s  you have already started with having the protagonist having a crush on a girl  we rarely see a  possible  lgbtq  lead so props to you guys  make something different and do not be afraid to take risks  overall i like the show and feel like if people give a second season a chance we may really see the ball get rolling  i am super confused as to how this is getting such great reviews  the series felt like a brief overview of a story  a cliff notes  the in between of a movie and a tv series too short for the in depth look you had   you would expect from a series and too long to be considered a movie  just felt like they did not really try  hoo boy  this show annoys me  it had so much potential but it wasted it  let us start at the beginningepisodes     are very boring and repetitive and almost stopped me from finishing the show  i feel like they could have been cut down into   or   episodes and accomplish just as much  and for a show that has   that is only      episodes long  you do not have time to waste repeating yourself  they had   they would just have sydney have a bad day  have her powers blow up  and then repeat also for the first   out of   episodes remember  syd is just an absolute rude to the people who try to be nice to her  except dina   for example  in the bowling alley scene  she makes light  and or fun  of stan s abusive relationship with his dad  also does not help that stan seems a more interesting character than her now  i believe the show gets tremendously better from episodes      syd gets to be more than just angry sad girl and gets to interact with dina  stan and her family in better ways and the story trajectory is looking very interesting but they could not stick the landing  and up until a point  i was loving the final episode  the characters are gelling together perfectly and the story s climax is  chef s kiss  brad s death is such an interesting way to take the story but the writer s had to go and ruin it with the most lazy and cliche cliffhanger i would have been perfectly fine if the show had just ended right there with brad s death  however the writer s had to end it with that cheesy ass line  let us begin    it reminded me of   game of thrones writing it was that bad  it ends the story abruptly and leaves me so unsatisfied now  overall i think this show is a solid     and i will definitely tune in to season   but goddamn i am so annoyed right now i made an account just to review this  it has   it is from the producers of stranger things so you get those vibes but it has   it is so much better  it has   it is darker  deals with more emotions  and is written so well  please watch this i am not okay with this is in similar lines of the end of the fucking world  but with some superpowers and twistssophia lillis was good as the lead and this story just got started with it has   it is final episodealthough the story could have been more strong just like the cast and the act of sophia  i believe it might improve further it has   it is credibility and story tellingi would rate     for this twisted superpower netflix original series easy going  tailored by many cliches yet very adorable  good cast  leading character sophia lillis has star qualities the most enjoyable netflix original show watched  relatable and love the film look a typical netflix show by numbers the lead character is always lesbian  what a suprise the guy is always kind of a wimp  nerd  outsider that has   that is bad in bed  the rest of the guys in a standard netflix show is mostly portayed as bad jockeys or bullies  there has   there is never anyone likeable the soundtrack is also a typical boring thing  random spotify a little and throw some crappy tracks togheter  and people call it great worthless music and oldies nobody cares about and the mind superpower   it has   it is always the same  mind powers  nosebleed from stranger things is exactly the same  is it hard to come up with something else avoid to all costs  this series is a pretty typical adaption of a comic book teen coming of age comedy  it does not have a real hook and the use of the protagonist talking to herself is poorly done  the dialogue  the little that there is  has been done many times before  the angst is predictable and common  so the only thing new is the new superpowers sydney has  even that has been done before  there are many better adaptions done better  this one has nothing really new to offer  immediately this is going to get compared to carrie  and while the comparison is clearly something the show itself embraces  it is actually pretty far removed  at best you could say  like carrie  but with actually realistic people  this is where the show shines  in the realistic actions of its character  so many times there are opportunities for nonsensical reactions to heighten the horror or drama and not once are they taken  and yet it still remains compelling and interesting throughout overall it has   it is not a perfect score as the show leaves a lot of room to grow  and it it stopped at the first series then it will be pretty incomplete  it could also use a little more laugh out loud moments to balance out the drama  but all in all it is a brilliantly crafted show that will no doubt speak to a lot of people  without talking down to them  expected too much but its slow and irritating  plus  there has   there is no bit of adventure  what has   what is been exploring in the first episode is still there as an issue till halfway of the season  sorry but this was not cool at all  why people are calling it powerful no clue but it has   it is extremely powerless and is not at all gripping  you can relate few emotions but overall the show does not get to move on the right track  the big issue with this series was it was really boring  the storyline was predictable the characters had no personality or depth besides stanley  it felt like a bunch of decent   movie mashed together done really poorly  i am not okay with this  feels like it arrived super late to the   s nostalgia boom  it is ridden with clichés  easter eggs and references  it even has its own breakfast club inspired detention episode  not to mention the carrie esque season finale  it has   it is just lame at this point  everything in this show has been done before and way better  truly a montage of john hughes movies  writing was slow and poorly done  rip off of   teen films with a supernatural addition  a few episodes worth of story applied toward a full season   i hope this issue is resolved in season    this show  while good  is lackluster  felt more like an introduction than a full season  if you are over    you shall   you will have seen pretty much every trope in this tiresome mess done before  and better  many many times even if it has   it is your first foray into sabrina the teenage psyker  there has   there is really very little here to hold the attentionto be fair  the leads are at least in the ballpark for their acting ages  but that does not mean they are decent actors  they have little material to work with beyond cliches and gimmicks   there has   there is nothing really character driven here  and zero no chemistry between any of them the lesbian angle is predictable  tired and tawdry  this is kennedy  not amber the score is cookie cutter  but the sets  cinematography  and editing is decent enough  the people making this knew what they were doing   they just did not know why  and it has   it is clear that nobody had any fun with it  this movie looks great  seriously  great camera work  great production design  just a beautiful movie  it has   it is a crying shame the story was so poorly written and the film so poorly directed and edited that the craftsmanship of the cinematography is lost  this is an ambitious story that  sadly  the director and writer were not able to execute  there are a lot of ideas that are not   am not fleshed out  a lot of symbolism that is robbed of deeper meaning  and overall there is a story that does not get told  which is a shame  because i feel like the story they wanted to tell would have been very intr',\n",
       " 'iguing  but sadly they did not know how to tell it  maybe they can revisit this in a decade or two when they have learned their craft a bit more  I had   I would pay to see that  i have so many questions about this movie  but I shall   I will narrow it down to   questions    was that a zombie    why          gretel just yeets hansel out of her life so she can be  witchy  and do  witchy  things      why was gretel the only person in the movie without an english accent   anyway  watch if you want  was not the worst movie I have seen  but i was not a fan  absolutely awful  insulting to be in the horror genre  nothing about this film was scary or horrifying  first movie i ever considered walking out on or falling asleep to  only good thing i can say is the witch was perfectly  movie was extremely slow paced and never picks up at all  truly dreadful and waste of money  even the music choice was awful  robotic techno sounds like i was watching tron     it just falls short  and kind of leaves you unsatisfied  it has   it is beautiful and dark visually  and it had so much potential to be a great movie  but ends up being something better watched at home  well this movie has nothing to do with hansel and gretel really they just used the name to get publicity  hansel seems like an afterthought in this movie without no real impact the movie is really really boring and even though it is only   minutes it feels like a life time  this movie is like a dj who keeps building up and up and up but it never drops the beat never and you end up blue buying couple beers will provide much more entertainment for you than watching this    min movie that felt like    only bright spot was the actress playing the old witch  she was very creepy but nothing really happens i know the story as a kid  and i went in expecting this to be scary and totally different from the story as a kid  the same as they have turned other childhood stories into horror films  this film missed a lot of opportunities to develop the story to make it a great horror film  it was very boring  confusing and not scary at all  it seem like it was a prequel to a much bigger story  i would not waste my money going to the theater to see this  wait until it hits dvd or a streaming app  when the most memorable part of a movie is how many times characters  oink  like pigs  it has   it is not a good thing  the movie is pretty  that has   that is about it  the story goes nowhere  the plot is unengaging  and i was left underwhelmed  the film tries too hard to be artsy  stylish  and taken serious  unfortunately  this makes the movie feel slow and pointless  movies should feel like rollercosters  making the audience feel something  whether it be sadness  fear  or excitement  etc  this one felt equivalent to sitting in a   hour long college lecture on cinematography  I am not gonna say do not see this movie  but i will say that if you really want to see it  i recommend you wait until you can rent stream it to save your money and potentially time if you decide to turn it off  which is a perfect description of this film  muh feminism mixed in with good old fashion boredom  was this supposed to be scary  the only scary thing is the misandry  slow  boring  stupid  no payoff  at least   people in the theater were snoring  they were the lucky ones  the struggle was real  it was a constant fight to stay awake  twice i succumbed to the sandman only to wake up in the same dream   gretel   hansel  tried to put me out again but i was determined to stay awake and torture myself there has   there is no mystery what the premise of this movie is about  everyone knows the age old story of  hansel   gretel   a young brother and sister go into the woods  they find a house made of delicious treats  they eat from the house  get captured by a witch who fattens them up to eat them except they escape and kill her the story has been retold  remixed  and redone several times both literarily and cinematically  the last cinematic version i saw was with jeremy renner and gemma arterton in  hansel   gretel  witch hunters       that was more of a hansel   gretel the adult years where they hunt other witches to prevent other kids from getting eaten or worse this version tries to go the scary route  it was dark and ominous the majority of the movie  they also wanted to give it a new age spin by making gretel the main focus as you can probably gather by the title   gretel   hansel   they have followed the hollywood trend of other movies that have taken known and established stories or franchises and remade them to have a feminine focus  look no further than  star wars    terminator    ghostbusters    ocean s     and others  it has   it is lazy and it has   it is a disservice  the movies are trash  not because they are feminine centric  but because writers are just rehashing something that has made goo gobs of money and gave them heroines as though that is somehow fresh  radical  or unique  it has   it is none of those  it has   it is tired  lazy  and lame  do something new and original and maybe  just maybe  it will be good in  gretel   hansel  gretel was the older sister and  for the most part  caretaker of hansel  while wandering the woods in a state of near starvation they found the witch s house  the witch was a child eater  but she only wanted to eat hansel and not gretel  in gretel she saw power and wanted to help her cultivate that power  hansel  as the witch explained  was only weighing gretel down  if she would only let him go  then she would be free  read  if women would only discard the shackles known as men then they could realize their true potential  that same message was intimated elsewhere in the movie when gretel called the witch  misses  and the witch said   I am not married  do you see a ball and chain on me  if the message was not clear enough from the two aforementioned examples  then there were three men in the movie to make the  male bad  female good  message stronger  of the three men  one was morally reprehensible  one was some sort of animal  and one was chivalrous  so  two of the three men were dangerous while one was good  if that was analogous to real life then that has   that is sad  i only hope that I am of the     that are good gretel finds the strength to save her brother from being eaten  but she also lets him go  the boy was all of nine years old at the oldest and yet he is a male so she had to cut him loose to be the goddess she was meant to be  it has   it is a pathetic retelling of a classic in which neither hansel nor gretel was the dominant character  maybe one day hollywood writers will be creative for a change  and maybe pigs will fly  there has   there is so much they could have done in this movie  but they just    did not  very boring  this movie is not for everybody  that being said  i thoroughly enjoyed it  it has   it is beautifully shot and very well acted  the music by rob is pure fire  this is an art piece for sure  if you are into artsy films with heavy synth soundtracks and gorgeous witches  you shall   you will love this movie  the goth in my black heart loved every minute  🖤 the trailer was the best part of the movie  they had the opportunity to do more with it and missed the mark  definitely should have gone straight to dvd or netflix  i cannot believe i actually paid to see this nothing movie  no action  horror or real story  i kept waiting for something to happen but it never did  people were asleep in the theater and i was debating if  i only have   words for this movie  boring  confusing  and plain in this movie it starts off with the mother of the children angry and wanting the kids out of the house  it starts off kind of how women are better than men  weird but ok i can ignore that  but through out the film the witches also want gretel to learn more because men will resent a powerful woman and end up hating her  at one point during the film gretel gets her period for no reason at all  it has   it is such a weird symbolic movie against men and pro women that kind of isolates the audience  it would have been a  ore interesting film had they left that narrative out apparently witches have feminist values this movie was somewhat disappointing  i did  however  liked the cinematography in this film  the acting was great as well  the problem with the movie is that  it didnt have much going for this movie  i did not connect with the characters in this film and it seemed very plain as far as the story went  i wont spoil anything here but it felt like this could have been much more in my opinion  but  i guess i shouldnt of expected too much from a horror movie in january  i find myself becoming very disillusioned with hollywood s trend of marketing films as horror films  regardless of whether or not they actually hit the mark as horror the plot was underdeveloped yet had so much potential  I have seen the actress who plays gretel in other films before  it  it chapter    sharp objects  and she has   she is always impressed  however in this film  i feel she was not given material that could have been transformed into something more engaging and interesting  the film seemed to want to be artistic  edgy  mysterious  however it failed to really allow for the characters to develop in any real or measurable way there are so many unanswered questions but they do not make the film mysterious as much as it makes the film seem unfinished and showcase the lack of effort put into the script why did the mother lose her mind and throw out her children why was gretel fine with sending her brother back home alone to this clearly unstable woman and stay at the witch s house just another very disappointing film  this movie falls into the niche category of horror movies that throw everything out the window  plot  dialogue  acting     in an effort to be artistic and cerebral  undoubtedly the cinematography is beautiful  but that has   that is the only positive  the plot is thin  the acting is okay but theres nothing there  and the overall movie was a bit boring  a definite creep factor  but not scary at all  which was a real let down  if i could put zero out of ten  i would  i does not deserve a review  boring movie  totally different from the original story  do not waste your money in this disaster of a movie  i took a nap  we decided to go see grettel and hansel after reading a review that it was the  scariest of    whoever wrote that review needs to be schooled in what a horror movie entails  this movie had no plot  eluded to certain gory aspects but  never showed them  i found myself falling asleep waiting for it to be over  do not waste your money or your time on this one  i would not even waste a redbox rental  just a typical january movie  but this one is just sooooo boring  it just fails to gain your attention  you are just waiting for something to happen but it does not  first time i almost walked out of the theater but i did not just so i can tell that the whole movie sucked  the film starten good for me  an intriguing background story of a twisted evil child  the techno music  which some find inappropriate for a film like this  gave the beginning of the film a eerie atmosphere  as time went on  i found that this scary atmosphere was abandoned for an incoherent story that itself did not know where it wanted to go  nevertheless  i thought the film was definitely worth seeing  thanks to the eerie begin and the horrific performance of the witch  gretel and hansel is a film that the mainstream horror fan will not completely reject but that will not be able to appeal to them  maybe we missed something  me and my friend walked out rather disappointed after watching this movie  no clue  no suspense  no horror and well there was absolutely nothing fun about this movie  such a waste of money  it truly is the scariest movie of all time    if you are   years old or younger  maybe i honestly am shocked by all the positive reviews and high rotten tomatoes score  did i see a completely different movie  it starts off very well with a genuinely good opening scene  great cinematography  atmosphere  lighting  a likable child whom you connect with easily  and an interesting encounter takes place between this kid and a very creepy clown  the dialogue is good  there is an eerie sense of dread  and a moment where it aka pennywise goes from being a friendly ish clown to a terrifying villain in an instant through a very well placed awkward stare  it was a moment i was not expecting and gave me hope for the rest of the film  then    it has   it is all downhill from there  after an almost laughable use of cg  this movie has big issues  it is not scary',\n",
       " '  it has   it is story is weak  if you can even call it a story  it has too many underdeveloped characters  and it is a counterproductive villain with no concrete rules for what it can or can not do the overuse of cg ruined any sense of tension or fear and pennywise s tactics did not make sense  if he feeds off fear  why reveal himself to each of the kids within a close time period  why not concentrate on each child individually  causing far more mental torment and making them an easier kill  pennywise also just randomly manifests himself anywhere at anytime  and disappears randomly  i do not find it scary when the antagonist manifests itself  attacks a character and right before doing damage it vanishes  the story is a mess and there are far too many characters  i swear the first   minutes is the longest montage in film history  a montage of each child s development and exposure to pennywise  it was predictable and monotonous  as for the story  i do not know what to say  besides there really is not one  character motivations are weak  bill is the only one who makes sense  where were the parents at  not a single parent seemed to care about their missing children  the few on screen parents there were  came off as caricatures  and there were a few scenes that felt completely pointless within context of the story  the school bully and his dad  being the oddest so in closing  it is an uneven movie or more accurately a collection of scenes that do not flow well in a tangible story  there are some good laughs  and a few entertaining scenes  but all in all it has   it is just an average movie  which should have been an evident sign  when the original attached director cary fukunaga jumped ship  the opening scene is good  from there on   not as much i guess this movie will please those not familiar with the book much more than those who are  that being said  i do not think it is possible to make a satisfying adaption of  it  without doing it the game of thrones way  more time is needed to dwell on each of the novel s parts to create the feel the book gave us  to tell the story as it was told on paper  so i guess I shall   I will forgive the filmmakers for that the kids are okay  they have managed to portray the losers and the relationship between them decently enough  considering the running time  again  more time is needed for better development  much of what actually happened between the kids and it has been cut  but again   running time  they had to that they have changed the setting from the   to the   was a bad choice  and so are the other changes  they are creating scenes that are not   am not in the book  they are changing things that are there  the biggest problem i have with the film is the execution of the horror  constant jump scares  way too much cgi  and a complete lack of understanding of the fact that less is more  waiting for a scare is the scary part of horror  and this movie just throws everything at you constantly  it just is not terrifying  at all i did not find myself bored  though  besides the poor performance when it came to being scary  it is an okay movie  it just is not a good adaptation  i think the film was good  but did not really live up to expectations  i did not find it that scary  admittedly  one of the jump scares worked on me but otherwise i never felt any dread looming in the pit of my stomach  the film is gorier than the mini series  that has   that is for sure  and i liked that updated aspect  but nothing particularly shocked me  there was quite a bit of special effects that just were not very good  and i think that has   that is a big reason why i just was not very scared the other dumb thing i want to mention is that sometimes the characters fell into predictable horror movie tropes  its just kind of silly when they have already been scared by pennywise many times  knows this all  is not real  and yet will wander off by one of the missing kids going  come here   i mean  really  you are going to fall for that  i think what does save this film are the performances  bill does a good job with pennywise  however  he does lack the charm that tim curry had  but those were always going to be big shoes to fill   clown pun not intended   the kids though were amazing  in particular jaeden lieberher  who played bill  and sophia lillis  who played bev  were the standouts  i also want to give a shoutout to nicholas hamilton  who played henry  for managing to make me feel empathy for a bully  finn wolfhard  from stranger things  plays richie who is meant to be the jokester of the group  and finn does well with that character  i just wish the writers had laid off from the jokes some of the times  you are supposed to be building tension and it kind of gets ruined when he opens his mouth to make a joke about period blood or whatever i see the potential in this film  and i think it could have been really good  i just think they spent too much focus on  shock value  rather than building on an atmosphere  i do not even know what to say  there was so much wasted potential here  i will say that the cinematography  the location  and the children  the losers club  hold up really well for this film  yet  I am still sitting here after seeing this premiere and I am still shaking my head  here is the one thing for me  that ruined the movie  if you do not want any spoilers i suggest you stop reading  here goes  what is going on with all the cgi in this film  computer animated graphics have never scared me and this movie is littered with seemingly terrible and unimpressive visual effects  i had a feeling this was going to happen after watching the directors previous film  mama  anytime something was seemingly scary  or anytime i thought  hey  this movie might redeem itself  it was almost instantaneously followed by some cheap jump scare with a villain who was computer animated to look scary  the human eye is easy to detect how fake cgi can be and folks  let me tell you  this movie relies incredibly heavily on computer animated effects  no incredible monster movie effects from the   here  the sad part about it is that the movie takes place in the    instead of the   like the book   what better way to write a beautiful love letter to the time period than to get some natural  realistic  and horrifying movie effects  the   had the exorcist  top notch real effects  do you remember the thing from the    thhose practical effects still hold up to this day  its truly sad to see computer programs taking the forefront to create scares  anyway  I am rambling   for all of you fans of the book out there   spoiler alert again  you will be disappointed  it only uses the book as a small guideline for the story they decided to craft here  there is no ritual of chud  there is no mummy  werewolf  or drowned children in the standpipe  everything is rushed  this film is just a complete mess and it pains me to say so  if you have not read the book  maybe you shall   you will have a decent time if you can handle cgi  i for one thought it was extremely disappointing  confusing  and ultimately boring and cliché  god  i wish this could have gone a different way if you are truly interested in seeing it    please   please     save your money and go see something else  or at the very least  wait to rent it  what persuaded me to watch this movie was the blessing bestowed upon it by the stories original creator  stephen king  who claimed   i was not prepared for how good it really was  he has   he is not wrong  it  is quite extraordinary  the attention to detail  the subtle but effective comedic undertone and the exquisite cinematography not only do the original title proud  they make this re imagining of the original classic even better than its predecessor  it has   it is a very scary film but what impressed me was how true the film sticks to the original s tricks  it is not filled with loud in your face jump scares  in fact  a lot of what makes this film scary is the slick cinematography and intricate shadow play  the use of lighting and creation of atmosphere is what makes this film so tense  which is why it has   it is perfectly suited for those who like horror movies but without the obnoxious gore watched the pre release as a critic   august    i already had low expectations of this movie because of the immense cgi in the trailers  i felt super conflicted with this movie because the acting was amazing by the entire cast  however there was way too much  comic relief   this is a horror movie  i wanted to feel terrified because i was stuck in terror just about the whole movie  i should have left the theater sore because of being too tense  this did not happen at all  there was only one scene in the entire movie that felt like this and it was the bathroom scene with beverly  that was literally it  no pun intended   the clown was so cliché when it comes to cheap horror movie antics of the     s  it has the retractable teeth like every new zombie movie since the umbrella corporation and it moves all jumpy like every ghost movie that has been out since the ring  absolutely nothing scary about the clown  if tim curry were not in a wheel chair i would have rather had him come back and take the place of penny wise without any cgi  all of the cgi made this movie pure crap  the script writing was ridiculous and felt like it had been pushed through the works entirely too fast  each kids fear was super cheesy and again  nothing but cgi on the tackiest scale they could have ever done  it felt like this movie had so much potential but it was all thrown away because they were too afraid to make it  actually scary   those of you who are real horror movie fans  you will be disappointed  this should have been a  straight to netflix  movie as far as I am concerned and i wish i could have gotten at least     of my money back it has become ritual for me to read the novel  it  once a year every year since it was released in    the story is more than a gore fest  it has   it is a story about love and hope and friendship that is still meaningful to me to this day the only thing this movie has in common with the beloved book  is its name and the characters names  it is a literal disaster and a slap in the face to anyone who actually read and cherishes the book  there are no character backstories  nor character development at all  you are literally thrust into the movie expecting to know everything about everyone and why they are the way they are  ie  henry bowers and why he hates the  losers club    he literally starts the movie trying to kill them  this is sad  because a large portion of the novel was meticulously spent doing quite the opposite and made you relate to and fall in love with the characters editing  what editing  this is the worst edited movie I have ever seen in my life and I have seen a lot in   years  it was literally like the film makers shot   scenes  put the film in a hat  and took out said scenes and spliced them together at total random  i cannot describe it any other way than saying  at one point  one of the characters  i cannot tell who  because they all share the exact same personality  says   i banged your mom last night   or something similar  and before the audience can even react  the scene changes to a jump scare happening in another part of town instantly and with no rhyme or reason  you do not have time to laugh at jokes  because they are not   am not funny  unlike stephen king s jokes in the book    and you do not have time to be scared  because you are still trying to process the dick joke that was still being told when the scene abruptly ended while the filming location for the town of derry was suitable  having the movie take place in the   s instead of the   s just to appease the  stranger things  crowd was simply a terrible decision  the   s were a totally different time  and much of the characters  reasoning and mannerisms that you need to make this movie work are lost to a time and cultural difference  these guys call themselves  the losers squad  in this movie for god s sake  kids did not start calling themselves a  squad  until the   s  ie  the monster squad  so  you love the book like me and are still reading  thank you  now let me list just some things that we both love about the book that you will not find anywhere in this movie  the deadlights  the ritual of chud  the mummy and the bridge  the loser s club dam in the barrens  the moving picture book  now its a slide machine   the smokehouse   this is battery acid   the werewolf  making the silver bullet after a game of monopoly  the stand pipe  bower s hair turning white   beep beep richie   the giant bird  the   s ',\n",
       " 'racism against mike  actually mike hanlon himself is missing  the writers just made arguably the most important character an afterthought in this movie   character backstories   hi ho silver away    haystack    i could go on and on and on with god awful editing  absolutely no character backstories  cheap teen jump scares  not being faithful to the book  and too much cgi usage  simply put   if you want to know how this movie is like the book  read the first   pages of  it   and burn the other   pages because that is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortion  I am a huge fan of the   s tv film of  it   especially for its aesthetics and soundtrack  but it left out a lot of content from the original novel  leaving me confused when i first saw it at the age of    this remake  or perhaps actually a  re adaptation   is certainly very timely  what with  stranger things  becoming so huge with pretentious hipsters everywhere  I am still not sure it hits the  scary  factor very well  especially without tim curry s tremendous acting  but it has   it is certainly creepy  it has   it is not nostalgic though  nor does it retain much of the original novel  including the   s setting  changed to the   s to obviously market itself with  stranger things  and  the goonies  my problem with this new adaptation of  it  is that it has   it is addled with cgi and jump scares  neither of which add to its nostalgic appeal  at the risk of sounding like a film snob  if you are trying to make a film set decades before this era  you do not use cgi at all if you can avoid it  unless you really know how to camouflage it  the constant profanity did nothing for the story either  it only gave the false illusion of being edgy  yes  the book had profanity  but king knew where to draw the line and keep the perfect balance of immature vulgarity and true friendship  the sheer level of nerdiness here made me cringe  unlike the tv movie which had genuine friendships and sweet moments of love and joy amidst the horror  just like king s novel  did one of those boys seriously just say  get me my bifocals  i hid them in my second fanny pack   what the hell kind of child wears bifocals  why not just rename him poindexter while they are at it  the kids in the book and the miniseries were never this obnoxiously dorky  and what has   what is with all this new kids on the block stuff  there was a scene in which for no apparent reason all these close ups of nkotb posters pop up on screen  why  just because earlier in the film a kid had been listening to that music  it made no sense  we get loads of terrible one liners from richie comparing the blood in the sewers to  period blood   lovely  eh   and trust me  no way does any thirteen year old talk like this  all kids at that age swear and tell fart jokes and stuff  but even they have their limits mike is only added as an afterthought  which seems borderline offensive  as if they only added him as a token minority whereas in the book and film he was such a complex  central character  he had a strong bond with his father that has   that is totally absent from this film  stan is unlikable  and the newly revamped pennywise the clown has teeth that could rival the most inbred hillbilly  and the most scary thing he seems to be able to do is hop around like some kind of wino  uh yeah  real  spooky   I am shaking in my boots  then we have the film s complete disregard for the friendship  the glue that holds the story together  killing and gore and sex and violence and swearing is not what horror is about  it has   it is about the darker side of life  and this film only portrays it in a cheesy slasher film type of way  I am not trying to sound preachy  but where has   where is the love and friendship between the characters  when it is there  which is not very often  it feels forced  in the old miniseries  it felt authentic and true  and the kids were actually portrayed as kids  not young adults  this new film is completely void of the book s special qualities such as the  hi ho silver   thing and eddie s  battery acid  line  the film just does not have the stunning scenery that the miniseries had  either  the miniseries had an actual gothic revival pump house as the sewer building  the buntzen hydroelectric station of british columbia   and it was creepy and nostalgic and absolutely the perfect choice  it had nailed down the industrial small town in an economic slump kind of look perfectly  too  this film looks too clean for that  with cgi used in all the wrong places to create what looks like fake looking stage sets this film is not completely terrible  it passes the time  but the only thing it has going for it is that the director thinks he has hit some   s vibe gold mine when in reality it just looked like a bad video game full of childish jump scares  i was hoping it might be more like the   film sinister  a genuinely frightening and timeless boogeyman that leaves a subtle unsettling presence wherever it goes  but no  it just looked cheap and lazy  an obvious cash grab that has   that is being way overhyped  a       rating  are you kidding me  even king s   notoriously bad film the mangler was better than this  it has   it is like with good marketing  this new film was able to pull the wool over everybody s eyes and fool them into thinking it was a classic masterpiece  the opening scene of it is so promising   well directed  atmospheric  and skarsgard s clown is compelling to watch  there is a brief moment where while laughing mutually with the kid  the clown suddenly goes quiet and stares menacingly  its brilliantly unsettling  but sadly  that has   that is it as far as unsettling clown performances go   the rest of the film is typical cgi scares  and the clown throwing out taunts like the deriative satire of scary terry in rick and morty  the cinematography and acting is great  its watchable in an afternoon netflix kind of way  but there is no real gist  goal or drive to the story  it all just sort of unfolds scene after scene  goalless and drifty like the string along nature of a police academy film  its ok   but it really is not the classic that people are making out to be  its been incredibly over hyped  i personally found insidious to be a far more effective supernatural chiller  i managed to win a preview screening to  it  on the   of august  in sydney  i had high expectations for this film   and it exceeded them  the acting  great performances all round  the kids had great chemistry  and you really believe that they were all great friends  it reminded me of stand by me and the goonies  out of the child actors  richie  played by finn wolfhard  was my favourite and his jokes cracked the whole cinema up  bill skarsgård as pennywise is scary and really creeped me out  but for me there was just something missing about his character and i think he was not given enough dialogue a minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed  in terms with the development of mike  played by chosen jacobs   but for an adaption from a book  they managed to condense the original material very well overall  it  no pun intended  was a great thriller film that kept me on the edge of my seat  with strong performances  dare i say it  the cheesy   mini series is far superior  despite the hype  this adaptation was a real letdown  the kids were great  however the the cgi was awful and the jump scares were cheap bill skarsgard  hard to tell between him and the cgi this adaptation was lacking in both exposition and soul  all we have here is a cgi clown terrorising some kids  there is no depth to the story of his origins  there is no proper backstory regarding the kids there is absolutely none of the feeling of dread that both the book and the original mini series encapsulated  no atmosphere whatsoever its not a bad film  but highly lacking  there just is not the heart that was there in the mini series  in my opinion  the actors were fine  but the story was not there  i believe there is to be a next installment covering the  now  grown ups  I shall   I will probably watch it   if I have nothing better to do  it has   it is simply not steven king s  it   also they appear to have recycled the cgi lady from   mama  at one point   cannot find it now  but look out for it   beep beep  richie  appears once  so far as i can tell   a long way into the film  against all odds  i looked forward to this  but it has   it is another turkey  steven king tells great stories   why do the hollywood mob insist on killing them  i truly think this was dreadful and not a patch on the original  i hope to goodness they do not remake the stand   what is this  horror for kids  this movie convinces me that the world has gone mad  this is entertainment for what age groups exactly  if its for adults  why is there so much childish humour and dialogue appealing to the sensibilities of an age group that should not be watching this level of blood  guts and graphic murder  the story line is directed towards a certain mentality  which is not of appeal to adults  at least not mature adults  why on earth is this so popular  it failed to scare me on so many levels that i found myself imagining better scenes  how is it acceptable that kids of   years old were in the audience  looking at images of even younger children in the movie having their arm torn from their body  a man with a knife right in his throat  what the hell   as soon as it was revealed that all the horrors were their imaginations  it was a pointless exercise  what happened to all the kids that were floating down at the end  where was the main characters brother at the end  wait for the next episode  no thanks  i would have enjoyed a psychological horror  but gore is not what i was expecting  shows a lack of imagination by the director that he had to resort to this level of candy coated perversity  what a shame  wow  i honestly cannot believe these reviews  i made an imdb account just to write a review  i love the original and have seen it many times  this movie was horrible  i feel insulted by the directors  it was not scary at all  any potential  scary  scene was downplayed by jokes so forcefully inserted into the script  there are multiple  major holes in the story line as well  hole    the group of bullies never once said anything about their buddy missing hole    the girl is pulled down from  floating  and brought back to life  does not that mean that the hundreds of kids that come down from floating at the end come back to life too  or do their rotting corpses fill up the sewers for   years  does georgie come back to life too hole    the girl cannot decide which boy she loves  she took the poem from the pudgy kids room  i have to assume because she randomly ends up with it in her bedroom  but then she thinks that bill wrote the poem somehow  the pudgy kid kisses her  bringing her back to life  true love brings back the dead girl like princess   the frog or something  but she winds up with bill  every cheesy  horror film jump scene was witnessed in this film  the acting was good  but i cannot see how this is touted as a horror film  i felt like i was watching a disney movie by the end of it   spoliers honestly i was really excited about this movie  like really excited  i watched the original it this morning to get ready for it and have some reference  and it was absolutely terrible  seriously  terrible  not only did i want to walk out the second pennywise was shown in the beginning but the rest was torture  i was with other people so i could not walk out  here s the thing  this is the first time I have ever been so disappointed with a movie that i went out of my way to write a review about it  the clown was not scary in the slightest  the teeth were stupid  the acting was a joke  the kids made a ton of terrible and sexual jokes  it did not stick to the original movie whatsoever  they took the  you shall   you will float too  a little too seriously  it just plain sucked  in the original  the kids were innocent and actually dorks but this was pathetic the way the kids were talking  and why the hell did we watch them in their underwear    i still keep wondering how the hell this movie is rated above an   when it should be a disappointment for anyone who knows what a good movie is  this was so much cgi that it took away from the whole movie  i could keep going but i think I have made my point  i would not waste your time or money  watch the trailer and that has   that is as good as it gets  ugh  I shall   I will start this review by addressing that i had no expectation for the movie  i am not a fan of the horror genre as it usually lacks',\n",
       " ' the thought provoking aspects i look forward to in film  but the reviews were great and i thought I had   I would give it a shot the films antagonist is a demon clown  who can shape shift and move through space in an instant as demonstrated during the film  it abducts  kills and eats children  but can only do so if they are experiencing fear  in the finale fight scene of the movie pennywise is unable to kill and eat beverly because she is not afraid of it but at the start of the movie he kills georgie after having a   minutes conversation with him where they laugh and mingle  georgie even reaches towards it to grab his boat   would he really be so scared of it at that point or was beverly so not scared of an actual demon holding her up by the neck the films plot surrounds around a bunch of disasters that the kids find out seem to happen every   years  this information is found out by a   year old kid named ben  and he figured this out by reading some articles in a library  so this entire town of people has not been able to figure this out  and he informs the rest of the gang that in derry there are substantially more children going missing than anywhere else in the us   if that is the case who is doing the abducting of children when pennywise is on its break all of the disasters have happened near sewage drains  that has   that is how the kids are able to figure out where it lives  but at one point of the movie how was pennywise able to appear in places that have no actual relation to the sewage  pennywise appears and disappears in bills garage and basement  beverlys bathroom  in a building where mikes parents died and in stanleys dads office  if it can appear anywhere why does he choose to murder and abduct near the drain if its only purpose is to feed upon the children as demonstrated in the final act of the film  he is willing to make a deal with the gang to keep bill and let the rest of the children go as after eating bill he would start his   year break again  why would a killer demon clown not be willing to let these kids go anyways and just hunt the other kids in town to feed as these kids are obviously trying to kill him pennywise seems to have unfathomable power as in a scene it is using hair from beverlys sink to grab and pull her but in the final scene it is having a fist fight with a bunch of children  could not it control some sort of object found in the sewer instead to do the same  why is it choosing to not use its full power against people who are fighting back but use such powerful methods when just trying to scare somebody the movie is riddled with cliche has   he is about the bully having a really strict father  the plot point that the only way they can defeat the evil all powerful shape shifting demigod of a clown is to stick together and get over their fears  and of course the scene where the boys find beverly levitating in mid air while she is in a complete state of trance   a coma  and what brings her out of this is a kiss on the lips from one of the boys  before the movie ends beverly is talking about this moment saying  it was like being dead  but when she comes out of her coma she without taking a breath starts quoting the poem one of the boys had sent her the movie takes place during the three months of summer and ends with the start of september where the kids still look bruised and battered from their fight  so it has   it is safe to assume it must have been like a week since it happened  what were the kids doing the rest of the summer as they started seeing the clown as soon as school was out  were they just having terrifying hallucinations of a killer clown and then enjoying the rest of their summer at the beach before going out and hunting it down  the times pan of events in the movie do not seem to reflect the time it actually took to accomplish them this is the first time i have ever considered walking out of the cinema during a movie  nothing  this was a staggeringly ham fisted approach to either king s novel or the miniseries based on it  it missed the point utterly    you will not see a group of children whose shared bond enables them to overcome a monster  you will see a load of bickering kids who seem to barely tolerate each other come together briefly to rescue the kidnapped object of their pre teen lust  you will not see an intelligently written story  you will see a dumbed down  by the numbers screenplay  complete with the usual beats  crisis of faith  catharsis  and all  you will not see belief overpowering evil  you will see a ten minute fight scene where every kid tries to out cool every other kid and get off a schwarzeneggerian one liner this movie is garbage  i cannot express it more eloquently than that  i had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of it in brisbane  the film is absolutely brilliant  bill skarsgård has taken pennywise and made the role his own  creepy  disturbing  humorous  it really possess the creep factor  giving audiences a new reason to fear clowns  the entire casting choices were sensational  all actors really held their own  creating a sense of comradery between the characters  like most people  i do hold the miniseries with tim curry close to my heart  but after seeing this adaptation  i was beyond pleasantly surprised  so much so that upon it being released into cinemas  I shall   I will be back in line to see it again  it really is ridiculous how this movie is being praised like crazy   this movie is so fvcking generic  it was not scary nor was it funny   just stupid   this movie is full of jump scares  that has   that is literally all the movie does  in attempt to  scare  the audience  it has   it is the cheapest and laziest way  to  scare  people  many times the kids in this movie try to be funny  but come off really stupid instead   the scene where the two groups of kids are throwing rocks at each other  and the movie is playing some rock music is so cringy  what the hell  was the point of that scene  ridiculous   and what was up with that zombie homeless looking dude  that zombie guy  talks like a death metal singer and i felt like i was watching the  walking dead   i did not give a fat fvck about any of the kids in this movie  i was  not interested nor was i rooting for the kids  there was nothing  special about any of the kid characters  none of the kids of the   losers club  gets killed in this film  all that tension and none of  the kids get killed  not one    close to the end of the film  pennywise gets his ass beat by a group of  kids with baseball bats and chains  lol  he could not fight them back   stupid movie  first i wanna say great family movie  bring the kids    so they can laugh along with you  i do not want to spoil the immense amount of nothing that happens in this movie  or how you shall   you will grow bored of waiting for  it  to get scary  but i do want to know how much they were paying people walking into the screenings giving this movie a   star rating  or how large is the pr team  i laugh when i see red balloons now  thought i was going to see a horror movie  got a comedy   talk about a let down  having not seen the original movie and only tidbits of the trailer  i did not really know what to expect when walking into the cinema this evening  someone described the movie as  the goonies  meets  a nightmare on elm street    this turned out to be an extremely accurate description the opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark  yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercut by comedy  this happens repeatedly throughout the film  and it works  my friends and i  as well as the entire packed cinema  found ourselves gasping at scenes of sheer terror  then only moments later laughing hysterically at the banter between the main characters i would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart  yet i think even those individuals would find themselves enjoying  it   if not for the horror  then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie  it has   it is as if this is a movie within a movie  a mix of a high school problems coming of age movie and a horror  a brilliant two for one if you ask me great acting from all of the cast as well as excellent writing make this movie a must watch  i am very surprised that this film got such a high ranking  i enjoy the books  films and tv shows of stephen king but found that this film fell way too short  the trailer looks great and pennywise the clown looks terrifying so i was really looking forward to seeing this  but after watching this film which is over   hours long i could not wait for it to finish i was waiting for it to get better but it does not   there was no scare factor whatsoever i just found it a bit boring and such a let down  i really feel this should have just gone straight to dvd   way over hyped  if you liked the goonies  you shall   you will love this  a shockingly poor attempt at producing a horror  terrifying  it is not  scary  it is not  I have seen more horror at at child s party  the tea cup ride at your local fair ground will give you more of a thrill talk about the cliché central  a slow  plot holed  far fetched  continuity riddled farce  cgi was cheap and out of place  this is not a horror  or even a b movie horror  this is more akin to a comedy at best  of course you shall   you will get the odd  jump factor  thrown in for good measure   even these are predictable and poorly scripted  sad to say  scary movie would deserve an oscar pitted against this mess the only saving grace was the make up department did a great job and the acting was not completely off the hype surrounding this film was very well done   i congratulate the marketing and pr companies spin for a complete piece of trash  please  please please   do not franchise this  no more it has   it is not worthy of the big screen cinema  save your money  wait for the dvd bluray release to turn up in your local penny shop  i had high hopes for this movie  in fact  you could say this was one of the most anticipated movies of my lifetime  i was psychologically tormented by tim curry at the age of    and it took several years to get over the weekly nightmares  although aspects of the trailers made me concerned this was going to turn into a jump scare film that you stop taking seriously by the midpoint  the overwhelmingly positive reviews that were coming out after the initial screenings had me optimistic and excited to be the first one telling everyone to go see it  unfortunately  i cannot do that after seeing it the first   minutes of the film were perfect  ultimately what i was most looking forward to from it was a new take on pennywise  i wanted to see what a different actor could do with him  particularly his ability to be psychologically creepy and disturbing  and i felt like i got that in the first scene  and that was pretty much it  after the georgie scene it seemed like anything skarsgård did was masked by cgi  overblown audio  and distracting cinematography in      of his remaining screen time  what has   what is sad is i think the mainstream audience will still eat this style up  the same people who will call this pennywise scarier than the last are the people who said the star wars prequels were better because they had more light sabers in them  ok sure  i enjoyed the crude richie and eddie humor  and thought it was well cast for the most part  but by the end i was almost yawning through the pennywise scenes  i just got out of the film and am alone in a dark basement right now and am not scared in the slightest  there is something wrong with that  as someone who had high hopes for this movie  i can honestly say i am monumentally disappointed  in an attempt to make a more visually stimulating remake of the classic it  this movie ending up looking more like a salvador dali painting  if dali were extremely tacky  the fear factor was taken out and replaced with jump scares and unnecessary gore  and i love gore  bill skarsgard s pennywise seemed more like a mentally incapacitated pedophile than an embodiment of fear  the only salvageable parts of this movie were due to the outstanding child actors and finn wolfhard s admittedly immature  yet hilarious wise cracks  i had hoped that because of this the relationship between the   friends would be properly represented  however  the introduction of certain characters and their back stories were extremely rushed or completely skipped over despite the fact that this movie was about     hours long and focused only on the childhood of the it characters  the only new thing introduced to this movie  that was actually worth watching was the scene with bill and geo',\n",
       " 'rgie near the end  it might be a fun movie to watch with your friends and laugh at  but do not pay money to watch it  it has   it is been a while since I have read the book or seen the first movie  so i apologize if i get some things wrong tldr  the film drags on in the middle by splitting up the crew and subjecting them to meaningless jump scares  this means little character interaction  which is part of what the first movie had going for it   by the time you get to the final confrontation with pennywise  you are just tired of the jump scares and want it to be over because you are not really rooting for the losers  and if you are  it has   it is mostly because of what was established in the first film pros the film starts off great  somehow the scene at the bridge manages to match the iconic opening scene of the first skarsgård is an amazing pennywise and is creepy as hell stan s speech in richie s second flashback is great and actually funny casting is  for the most part  really good  i think it was hard for some of the adult actors to find a balance between being recognizable while still showing how they have matured over time  adult richie is too kid like while bev is too mature to the point of being unrecognizable cons bowers is half assed  literally just used for three jump scares and nothing else  either imply that he died and leave him out or fully use him like he is in the book as the epitome of the corruption in derry the final form of pennywise is unsatisfying  it has   it is literally a clown torso on some sort of arachnid body  they needed to go full arachnid alien like it is in the book  i think this part is just difficult to translate from the book though stan s letter at the end cheapens his death  instead of him literally being unable to handle his fear of it  his suicide is portrayed as a sacrifice to save the others there has   there is next to no character development and very little meaningful interaction between characters  i blame this mostly on the middle   minutes where they all split up  it has   it is totally different from the first film where they are actually a team speaking of which  this part where they all go their separate ways to find their  tokens  is so contrived  the story literally loses all its steam due to this and makes it feel way too long all of the monster scenes except the ones with pennywise have terrible cgi  they might be gross and or startling but you can see them coming and they do not contribute much about     to     of the jokes just kinda fell flat the constant jump scenes and long running time just make this movie exhausting to watch  it was just a constant cycle of  pan to character  give a little backstory  jump scare  repeat   i really  realllly wanted to like this film  as a huge fan of the original mini series  and everything tim curry   i knew I had   I would have a challenge going into both chapter   and chapter   with an open mind  i had to separate  i did not have as high of expectations as i did for chapter   as part   of the mini series was much weaker than the part   anyway as well as stephen king s it  book  the actors were great  even the first few jump scares were decent  and then it just became overkill  and not scary whatsoever  all of the cgi monsters look ridiculous and completely take you out of the moment  i grew up watching     horror  and loving it   the baddies were real and terrifying  for example  mrs  massey  the bloated bathtub corpse in the shining  that was a real  completely horrifying image that has stayed with me   years after i first saw the movie  i do not understand the obsession with cgi when there has   there is no need for it sadly  this movie was just a drawn out bore  why they tried to add so much humor is beyond me  it ruined the entire movie now the guy that plays pennywise did a great job  except for the cgi pennywise  that was out of his hands  when he played the character with no cgi i was blown away  I am a big baby when it comes to scary movies and even i can say i was not scared  the jump scares were alright but the cgi monsters just made the movie feel immature  also    pennywise is a flesh eating clown with hypnotic powers     and they bullied him to death to defeat him  it was just such a corny scene watching pennywise shrink as they say mean things to him lmao firstly  those people giving this a   and      what did they put in your popcorn   did you see a different movie   should you be allowed to leave reviews if your taste in movies is that bad   some poor sod might read your review and go see this movie   do you not feel any guilt this was awful  its not even worth constructing proper sentences for so I shall   I will leave these points here    the terrible acting  it was awful  the actors were either bored or overacting  bill  mike  richie   seriously terrible    what on earth was the need to make this a   hour movie   it was so unnecessarily dragged out and incredibly    the story had no story  mike tells them there has   there is an indian ritual they must collect artefacts for which separates them all for   hours of the movie but then it turns out there was no ritual   what   what was the point of that   ben threw into the fire something he had   he would held dear in his wallet for   years for   no     reason     seperating the characters like that and filling the scenes with flashbacks made sure there was no character    erm what happened to bills wife  bev is kissing all the guys but is still married  they turned bev s character into a gold digging floozy by having her kiss bill then choose the wealthy and better looking ben for his boat     what in the name of all that is mike myers was that terrible cgi about   the old granny scene in the original was scary as she was a creepy old lady not a   foot naked zombie like    speaking of zombies   bowers zombie friend drives cars and breaks him out of an asylum  if zombies can do that  why did pennywise need bowers    speaking of bowers   what was the point of him in all his over acting melodrama  he did nothing  except to prove you can be stabbed in the heart and walk away absolutely    stanley s suicide notes to each and every one of them that he wrote and posted before killing himself   the act was supposed to have been done out of pure fear   not as a human    the grand finale  after spending   hours looking for tokens and mike carrying around a badly built dustbin made in a beginner s pottery class  turns out all you had to do was hurt pennywises feelings by calling him a clown and he will turn into a baby  i have no words    reallypeople do yourselves a favour  avoid this at all costs agh   woah  agh   woah  agh   woah  agh   woah the beginning     mins was a decent setup  well shot and the dinner scene was somewhat funny  then it all goes down hill from there  only  god  knows how i wanted to love this film as a big fan of the  masterpiece  book  i was eager for part ii  i liked the first part  i didnt love it  but it was a good adaption in the other hand  the second part is    slow  i didnt feel the  chemistry  between the adult version of the losers club  dont get me wrong  the acting is good  but    something s off i didnt get the insinuations about ritchie s sexual orientation  why  and it wasnt in the book either   and the way they chose to kill pennywise  that was shameful  ultra simple solution and it made me feel dumb    sigh oh  last but not least  the cgi fest  i really dont like cgi in horror flicks  i dont think it is impossible to use it  not at all  but god    what a cgi monster fest    i think muschietti has a great future and a director  but there has   there is a lot to learn   it part ii is a let down  sadly     it is a disgrace because it is a gross betrayal of the original book  it   the book   is a psychological thriller about friendship  about relationships  it is about the deep fears we have as kids and which grow with us until we are adults  it is about how we learn fighting and ultimately defeating these fears it   the movie  this movie   is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and cgi with the sole purpose of jump scaring the audience  there is no narrative  no storytelling  nothing more than a random   and awfully long   sequence of third league horror vignettes shame on this movie   for   years  i dreamt of you  i craved you  I have missed you  pros the casting director very much shines in the spotlight here  if there is a category for best casting director in the academy award  i am all in to bet that it  chapter two s will not just get nominated  but win very big  the casting director deserves a standing ovation for choosing the right actors for the right characters that resemble a lot with the younger selves from the predecessor you will feel the emotional impact of the losers  club as a whole  the fear that feeds their souls  the memories that hunt them   the hopeless feeling that manipulates their strength all leave a strong impression to wonder within   about the various   disparate forms of it should give a blast of excitement to the audience  this is the most entertaining part of the movie where you get to watch new other worldly creatures lingering within the shadows or the old monsters are back to haunt them with a peek a boo  it is gross  weird and definitely strange the heartwarming story of the losers  club friendship is the beautiful gem you will find in no other horror movies this year  the connection they have is so strong and palpable an excellent set of transition techniques that jump from one place to another  giving that ominous vibe and at the same time feels like an adventure cons albeit the creatures are entertaining to watch  however it lacks the manifestation of the scary rituals that should follow  this is the main problem with the it movies  it is not terrifying nor scary enough to make you have a nightmare  even sometimes it is laughable due to its unprecedented nature of the creatures  features the real form of it is upsetting and disappointing  i can strongly say that the majority will love it has   it is true form from the   television mini series in comparison to the remake because that looks scarier  deadlier   more realistic it is super slow and draggy that it does not need to be at almost   hours mark    hours should be the best run time for this movie like it chapter one  it has nothing much to talk about especially during the first hour  reunion  get together  a few jumpscare parts  that has   that is all there is to it the second act of the movie  halfway  feels as if you are watching   to   different short films instead  because it has that slow burning nature  the scenes feel disjointed from one another  it spends around   minutes to an hour to look at every members of the losers  club being haunted by pennywise verdict  it chapter two is certainly fresh and enjoyable  hopes up not  its extremely slow going story may make the audience bore enough to put you into sleep mode  it chapter two walks you into a journey of the insidious derry town albeit its lack of formidable creatures  okay so saw the first remake of the movie  was absolutely in love  i went and saw the second one today and did not feel any where near close to what i felt for the first one  it was super long but that is not even what upset me  it was just lacking in delivery  pennywise was hardly in the movie  he was in it but they spent so much time soul searching the past of the characters that the real present stuff went lacking  needless to say the first remake is an all time favorite  this one  i definitely should have waited until it came out on dvd  just being honest  the first one was way to good for this to be part    it did not deliver the expectation that the first one set  well  this was a waste  this movie is just a long run of jumpscares  all the f ing time   not at all scary cgi monsters and reusing of the same jokes and  scares   i do not think the director has used a single practical effect in this picture there is no tension or character investing in this movie  and the director manages to make the cast  who works with what they have been giving  look terrible in their acting  it is not scary  just very  very annoying and does not live up to either the book  the mini tv series or part   of the reboot from    even though it also was an cgi orgy  if you like a horror movie  where you do not need a build of tension or the director sticking to a plot or giving the audience a decent payout  but just adds a lot of jumpscares for almost   hours   you will love this  but hey  it has   it is just my opinion   returning to their home town  the',\n",
       " ' now adult group of friends finds they have been gathered to fulfill the childhood promise that the killer clown pennywise has returned and is on the loose in the town  forcing them to put aside their past traumas to defeat the malevolent being once and for all this was a woefully underwhelming and overblown effort  among its many flaws is the most obvious issue in that there has   there is just no reason for the running time to last this long at all  so much of this one could have been cut down or outright removed  from the introduction of the gang one by one to see where their lives are like now that goes into plenty of detail that could have been accomplished easier  to the incidents in the asylum tormenting the residents inside or just the seemingly endless scenes depicting the escaped inmate under the clown s influence  that these are done in conjunction with utterly boring flashbacks and storytelling that shows how they used to be as kids that just go on forever  serve no purpose to the storyline at all and just seem to focus on seemingly random incidents that just plain dull to get through  it highlights the fact that the main clown does absolutely nothing here with so little screen time as we are focusing on the kids  flashbacks interacting with the clown or building the romance angle instead of in modern times  the other factor to lower this one are the entirely overblown scare attempts that fall completely flat  the cgi here manages to undo so much of the attempts that the scenes of the food coming to life in the chinese restaurant is laughably inept with the black pool looking like a deformed blob like mess that has   that is incredibly cheesy looking and makes no sense in the storyline how that works  much less comes off like any other expected outcome from the very start  likewise  flashbacks to show the kids interacting with pennywise  featuring the confrontation in the apartment  the statue coming to life in the park or the appearance from the sewer grate are all laughably bad and underwhelming with how crude they are  it has   it is pretty disheartening to see so much wasted time in a film this long feature so little chances for something to happen and then showcase such underwhelming and laughably bad work when they do appear  really undermining this one and making for a troublesome effort  there are only a few select aspects that work here  despite generally being underwhelming  the encounter with the kid in the hall of mirrors at the carnival stands out as a wholly enjoyable and solid enough effort that works off the darkness of the setting  the overall creepiness of the concept in general and stellar practical effects that are usually missing from these other scenes  as well  the spirit of unity and brotherhood that they display in the finale when they band together to take on the true form of the creature in the underground sewer lair of pennywise which is not only a great idea to see play out but has some energetic albeit comically over the top action that at least puts some life into things  combined with the creepiness of the main clown and the ability to kill off kids with graphic results  these are all that work for this one rated r  extreme graphic violence  graphic language  underage smoking and continuous violence against children  i personally did not enjoy it   so i did not have much hope for part   but i was expecting them to at least tone down the cgi instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy cgi effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more stephen king books are going to get remakes and it will not be long before we get an all cgi maximum overdrive movie remake there are more scenes with pennywise transforming and creating twisted ways to mess with the returning losers club members but sadly they are all done with cgi and are all standard copy and paste scenes from the original mini series and when the movie finally gets to it has   it is climax the makers of this  horror movie  think by simply making pennywise bigger it instills more fear into the audience when really all it does is scream cgi and all the suspence is watered down to bigger pixels on screen than there where before  terrifying the only and i do mean only saving grace this movie has is the cast they all do a great job on screen especially considering they have to pretend to be scared and flee in terror from a green screen it has   it is not the actors fault this movie was a big let down i recommend watching the original it mini series if you have not already seen it tim curry s performance as pennywise is the reason why people who grew up in the   have a fear of clowns because a great actor in the right role can make all the difference in a movie tim curry will always be pennywise no matter how many remakes are made just like judy garland will always be dorothy in the wizard of oz there performance makes the movie so memorable and it cannot be re created no matter how much cgi you use  after seeing chapter one i expected so much more  unfortunately it did not deliver  the film starts out with an overly graphic bashing scene that tries hard to be topical but instead seems to be there just to dare you to criticize it has   it is honesty  and things just go downhill from there  the loser s club of the first film reunites   years later to have another go at defeating pennywise  but where the kids were charming and you wanted to root for them  the adults all go separate ways to have their own jump scene moments through an overly long two hour middle section of the film  the film bogs because it keeps showing flashbacks to when they were kids instead of building the characters as adults  the effect is that you never really care about them as adults  they are just an excuse to show cgi monsters that never really scare you on any level  the pacing of the film is so roughshod that it never lets any suspense build as it jumps from one scene to the next  while you keep checking your watch wondering how much more of this you shall   you will have to endure  the middle becomes a bit of a horror film mish mash with an homage to john carpenter s the thing  verbatim quote and all  a little bit of toy story erector spider  a dash of poltergeist s native american mumbo jumbo added in with a couple of million years old space entity tossed in in case you needed something to understand what they are up against  james mcavoy s character is jokingly referred to as an author whose book endings suck  a nod to the book  and unfortunately this film does not improve on the novel  it has   it is just an overly long series of vignettes that tie to chapter one in an unsatisfying way   it chapter    is a film based on the steven king s novels  that was released on screen in order to express the horror that the evil clown exposed in the old town of derry  the direction is poor  seems like they did not even try to make it scary or post the image that this story was supposed to show  i remember a scene in the theater where i would laugh to those small babyheaded spiders  the cast looked like they were bored every minute of it  being there just for the title of the film and the publicity it had gained  they did not make any try to act  just reading words and acting accordingly like anybody could do it  the story had some interest but it was all sunk with the terrible acting and directing and at some point took the downroad for good as it seemed like they made it something up to fill it up as they were running out of time  there were many points during the film where i was annoyed  even bored  ready to sleep on my chair  the duration of the film was inexcusable like there were added extra nonsense minutes to it  to sum it up   it chapter    is a movie for young kids aged       because they would be the only ones to appreciate it  i would not recommend it for anyone over that age plus i would not pay to watch it again  it was a really bad try  i would add  pathetic at least  rating      i honestly cannot believe these reviews  this movie truly disappointed me  to director andy muschietti you should put more scenes about the clown  because i seen the scenes is just little bit  that is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortain  this is not horror film  terrifying  it is not  scary it is not  there is nothing scary about this movie  there was so much wasted potential here  consequently i found the movie too long and lost me some part of it  it just does not feel like anything great or memorable  good bye clown and good bye eddie  everything special from chapter one an both of the originals completely removed for cheap not scary cgi effects  lost it has   it is way for the all mighty hollywood blockbuster dollar i could not wait for it to end cgi was horrible at times wait for it to come out on video  at least you can pause it and take a break  very early on in  it chapter two  there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book  but messing up the ending  anyone who is familiar with the  it  book or original mini series will know the ending was not well liked  here now though they had a chance to rectify things  and i can assure you they did  not just in terms of the ending  but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one the film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours  the thing is though i cannot see it having the same impact if it were much shorter  there was a lot of layers to fit in  this is not your average  fast food  horror like the  conjuring  universe films  this is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror  the first half of the film especially  a long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters  showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again  then in the second half of the film  and yes I am talking about almost an entire   minutes  the film kicks into hyper drive with non stop  in your face horror   and it is a sight to behold the cast were again all perfectly selected  bill hader in particular steals the show  he is given some great one liners to work with  much the same as finn wolfhard was  and he nails every one of them  there is also a great stephen king cameo  this is not just a case of blink and you shall   you will miss him  he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue  i was not sure whether  it chapter two  would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves  but it certainly did  i had a great time with this movie and i think any lover of the genre will as well  the first it movie scared the bejeepers out of me  i mean what is scarier than a psychotic clown  unfortunately in chapter   unless you have arachnophobia this movie will do nothing for you in terms of thrills  i feel that one of the reasons the first movie was so good is because of skarsgaard s amazing acting as pennywise  this movie is just cg heavy and very little acting   spoiler  also on an unrelated note the homophobic hate crime at the beginning did absolutely nothing to add to the film and left my thinking  why was that necessary   it chapter   is not a very good movie  but itis not terrible either  i am a big fan of both the book and the mini series  so i may have gone in a bit biased  but where i really liked chapter    i just did not feel it for chapter   the acting is great  but somehow i was not invested in any of the characters  they were just that  characters i was pleasantly surprised the movie opened with the adrian melon scene  this scene is one that makes the story of it  and many other stories of mr  king  so great  besides the obvious evil of pennywise  there are also  real  threats  like homophobic villagers i was very disappointed in the fact the storyline of beverly s husband was completely cut  and the storyline of henry bowers was butchered  the fact that the losers were not only fighting pennywise  but also had to dodge attacks from real people  so more rational fears if you will  was what made the book and the mini series better than this flick all in all  it was an  okay  movie  not great  not terrible  just  meh   well  what can i say  i did not expect too much it has   it is difficult to transform a stephen king book into a good movie  but it has   it is possible  the shawshank redemption  dolores claiborne  stand by me     but there is more bad than good  this is one of the bad ones  lots of jumpscares  all so predictable  i was so bored  i',\n",
       " ' thought  oh please  not another one  and why do they always feel the need to change the plot  for instance the one about bill not being really sick  why do filmmakers think they know it better than stephen king  or steal from other movies  the thing  and the end  the end  that was the last straw for me  if you read the book you know what it really looks like  i was sooo hoping for a fantastic monster  they used enough cgi  did not they  maybe a little like the queen in alien  the one in the miniseries made me laugh   but no  what a mess  make the clown small  really  stay at home and spend the money on the book  i was very excited to see this film  have been since    when i saw the first one  unfortunately  this one was a huge mess i love the way the first it did not want to be just a horror movie  but rather took time to build up a story  emotional connection  that is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays  however  this was completely thrown out the window in the second one  considering how incredibly long this movie is     of it was just buildup for jumpscares  jumpscares themselves and weird cgi the worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on  jumping all over the place  and most of it was just for shock value  nothing important to the story what i did love was the casting  it was absolutely brilliant  especially eddie i guess this is once again a classic case of   bigger budget does not mean better movie  as well as more cgi does not mean better movie  look  i do not mind being entertained at the movies  but there does come the expectation with such an adaptation of one of the best and most beloved horror novels ever written that it accord some respect while remaining true to the source material my main problem with this film lies in its tonal inconsistency  i could never tell if it was attempting to set a somber  foreboding  menacing feeling  or if it was trying to create an atmosphere conducive towards a lighthearted  hilarious jump scare filled marathon  in one moment it hangs heavy in emotional gravitas  the opening scene is especially brutal and difficult to watch  and stanley s suicide is also fairly dark   and the next  it has   it is so ludicrously over the top and in your face in its execution of its  horror  elements that it produces a jarring sense of tonal discord  what exactly is this film attempting to be  the horror was so absurdly explicitly comedic in its execution  not helped by questionable effects work  that i must assume that was the intent  yet in taking such a directorial approach  it effectively nullified the entire foundation that the movie required to establish and help foment the dreadful tension  atmosphere  and tone necessitated by the narrative  and of which made the book so stellar   and further relegated all the work by the actors and all other aspects of the film that had helped establish it up to that point void  if it was not intentional  then it does nothing so well as to exemplify how the filmmakers hold a fundamental misunderstanding of what actual horror really entails  it chapter two  spends much of its runtime plodding through a mindless  rote  predictable checklist of the characters recovering their artifacts from their youths  to the same tired  mindless  rote  predictable jump scares thrown at you one after the other which you can see coming from a million miles off which further robbed them of all their potency  how am i supposed to care at all about the protagonists  emotional plights  which are portrayed in a serious light  when their antagonist and its supposedly evil forms who are responsible for them are utterly stripped of their malevolence and are portrayed in such a formulaic  repetitive  explicit  and laughably juvenile manner  yes  i know  it  manifests itself also as a pennywise who does utilize a childlike humor to lure his prey in  but that does not mean it was not the only way nor that the entity was not terrifying in all the revelations of its truest forms  they were terrifying in the novel  and here they are a downright riot  a little subtlety  suggestion  imagination  minimalism and unpredictability goes a long way and would have done this film wonders  as that has   that is where the real core of any effective horror resides  it would have not only have helped maintain tonal consistency  it would have made it genuinely unsettling  my theatre was howling at every turn  and I am completely left at a loss as to whether that was what the director intended as is  this film suffers an identity crisis  it is inconsistent  predictable  ludicrously  and unintentionally   hilarious  redundant  overly drawn out to the point of boredom  and worst of all  a downright insult to king  who I am shocked made the cameo he did in tacit approval of this screen adaptation abomination of his finest work  the glaring tonal juxtaposition and abysmal execution robbed me of all interest in witnessing the losers  club finally confront this ultimate evil terrorizing a small maine town every   years  because in the end  it was not an ultimate evil at all      it was a goddamn mockery of one and due to that  i walked out  truly  truly awful  in    henry ford introduced the assembly line to the ford motor company  he made a ton of money and was hailed as a leading innovator  now just a hundred years later  director andy musciehtti brings that same assembly line principle to it chapter two as he serves up his scary products in the exact fashion as the one before this sequel to the highest grossing horror movie of all time  unadjusted  takes place   years later in the same town of derry  maine  the rambunctious kids are all adults now and have gone on their separate paths to some form of success  unfortunately  the good fortune for each is put to an end by the return of pennywise  who seeks more victims for his twisted games  being the only ones that have stopped the evil force  the adults must come together again to put an end to this bloody mess director andy muschietti returns behind the camera after the record breaking success he earned from   s  it   for the second time around  muschietti goes even bigger and bolder than before  both in terms of the horror set pieces and the length when it comes to giving audiences what they came to see  muschietti delivers on adding even more blood  gore  and creepiness  pennywise s indescribable powers get even more creative as his prey are stalked and slaughtered with unnerving brutality the biggest fault that plagued the previous film was its recycling of cheap jump scares that were meant to artificially hold your attention  that same problem is even more glaring in the sequel as any scary moments are just startling moments where something pops out at the screen  the more they happen  the more predictable and boring they are to watch a runtime is never indicative of quality by itself  every movie should earn its length through skill and craftsmanship  and at   minutes   it chapter two  falls way short of earning its record breaking runtime  instead of the horror being a slow burn  it has   it is more of a slow churn as the recycled jump scares quickly lose their minuscule luster and make this already long film feel even longer screenwriter gary dauberman takes up the impossible task of adapting stephen king  a challenge that has killed the careers of countless adapters before him dauberman tries his best to break away from the ridiculousness within king s novel  but his efforts end up backfiring on him and make the film even more awkward as some elements are left in and some left out  the story wants you to take it pretty seriously  but keeping in the weird elements make that almost an impossible task muschietti did not do much to justify the excessive length  but dauberman should shoulder more of the blame with his uneven pacing  the film starts great with the together and playing off each other with a fun and brisk pace  then  against all logic  dauberman has them split up for ninety minutes  severely slowing things to a crawl and forcing the jump scares to keep you awake the highest regards should go to casting director rich delia as he has brilliantly put together a group of adult actors that uncannily look like their younger counterparts  unfortunately  good looks are the only quality some actors possess here james mcavoy does fine as bill  the most evident acting trait he shows off is his struggle to hide his scottish accent with a less than convincing new england one having a rocky    to say the least  jessica chastain follows up the bomb that was  dark phoenix  with another subpar performance  she does not shine as brightly as sophia lillis  younger beverly despite being the more acclaimed actress with a lot more screen time the standout performances come from the two bills in the cast  hader and skarsgård  hader plays adult richie and fairs the best in the cast at toeing the line between drama and comedy skarsgård as pennywise is a sight to see but unfortunately does not get seen for long stretches  between him and heath ledger s joker  future performances for clowns now have an insanely high bar to reach with over five hours of material between two films  the  it  series has come to a less than satisfying close with  it chapter two   there are some things to admire muschietti and co  for doing or trying to do  but for every great bill skarsgård moment  which is all of them   there were just as many moments of wasted potential due to unoriginal filmmaking  overall  between its highs and lows   it chapter two  makes for a semi enjoyable time  just make sure to bring a seat cushion  camille  who was drunk almost every hour of the day from the moment she arrived in town  tries to repress the traumas she has experienced but she is not very successful in that regard  we understand with instant flashback scenes how emotions that camille suppressed suddenly surfaced and she cannot cope with her past  the town s suc cessful drowning atmosphere  combined with masterful work of fiction and image management and with the convincing performance of amy adams  turns the series into a complete mood  so to speak  with the hypnotizing music that plays in the background while watching to the series we seem to be drunk in the wind gap with camille  there are great soundtracks from led zeppelin to the doors  from bob dylan to johnny cash the scene transitions between past memories and the present are very successful  it has   it is like the scenes are intertwined  you are not leaving the general story of the series as you watch the past memories scenes  it has   it is very well tuned  we see that the series does not go on a straight timeline  the scene at the beginning of the episodes is actually the final scene  although not in each episode  some episodes have these time shifts in the background of the series  the words shown for     seconds may give hints about the series  at least when you watch it carefully  it makes you think  who knows  maybe a subliminal message  you are unlikely to guess who the killer is  because in each section you focus on different people  ideas may change as new details emerge  so it has   it is a little hard to guess  something i like about this series  because an unpredictable series is more attractive to me i found the acting very good  i think amy adams deserves the golden globe award with this performance  she conveys her character s mood very well to the audience  you feel deeply the feelings of camille  amy adams and patricia clarkson are really good  i found the tension between them very good  unfortunately  it is not possible to escape from the parents we are attached to  camille also lives this situation deeply  i guess one of the most complicated things in life is the child parent relationship  eliza scanlen who plays the character amma is very successful  like two separate characters in the morning and night  it has   it is like there has   there is someone else in amma when it has   it is night  of course it is necessary to open a separate parentheses to sophia lillis  she performed very well although the first episode starts with a slow pace  the next episodes are moving well  and it reflects thriller very well  the entire town  including the police  seems to be looking for the killer from a single perspective  it has   it is like the killer is the whole town  i love watching horror movies but i cannot say I am scared most of the time  but in this series  there were a lot of scenes that creeped and disturbed me in the series the mystery of the killer is preserved until the last momen',\n",
       " 't  but in the final  the series shoots the audience in the heart with a single sentences  the series manages to leave a shocking effect on viewers with its final  sharp objects gave the message that it wanted to give in eight episodes  i can recommend it for those who love the psychological thriller and killer themed      absolutely brilliant  if your looking for a happy story  look somewhere else  very dark  very depressing  if you have it in you to watch  you get a masterfully spun story of true pain  true guilt and loss  also a very good depiction of mental health  with a final act that is jaw dropping  I have never written a review on here  but this is a masterpiece  the reviews that rate this series poorly   or comment on how slow it is  likely thought this was going to be a murder mystery  it is about murder  but the  who dun it  is secondary  this is a character study in damaged human beings  how they got to that point  and the different ways it manifests in their lives  it is dark and unflinching in some places  and it is fascinating  it is also incredibly well acted  the  slow burn  pace is a dramatic marinade  allowing us to really soak in the character and absorb the experience  it makes the finale that much more impactful  and what a twisty finale it was  if you like character driven stories wrapped in a murder mystery  this will not disappoint  is it slow  yes  it is  but it has   it is also beautifully made  the characters are amazing  the acting is even better and the story is catchy  it has   it is a mystery drama series   it supposed to be slow  to give you time to grow with the characters  to understand every detail  it has   it is not advertised as being the avengers   it has   it is not an action movie    absolutely amazing mini series  there were times that i was confused by quick cuts to flashbacks and flashes of gruesome scenes and wondered if they had   they would ever make sense  but all the while i knew they would come together in the end  this was absolutely true  by the end of the series  all these loose ends were neatly tied into a present with a bow on top  and then the very last scene of the finale blew my mind     would recommend watching  haunting first episode of a show that had me and my wife entranced for the full hour  the editing  cinematography  particularly the framing   mixture of original score and led zep songs  casting and performances were all      it has   it is interesting that amy adams  the best working actress without an oscar  might win an emmy first if the rest of the series is any indication  I have never posted a review before but just had to for this  I have also never binged watched   hours of tv straight before  this was brilliant from the beginning to the very last credit  this series has the nerve of season   of true detective  the cinematography of inception  the clipping of the blade runner  the grit of the wire and the family dysfunction of six feet under  it has   it is all the good things of cinematography in one series  great acting  suspense in every episode and a loss for it only being a miniseries  if you have seen any of adam s earlier works  this one will shock you  her character is not charming  glowing  sweet and innocent  her camille is broken  confused  and in deep pain she has to return to her home town to cover a murder for her newspaper  in doing so  she must confront her own past  which is full of abuse  neglect  addiction  murder     camille has never properly confronted her past  she has drowned it through work  alcohol  and sexual obsession  adam s performance is so nuanced  so perfect  she conveys with a glance what most actors cannot with a soliloquy the production is spot on   especially the editing  camille s past and present collide in quite breathtaking turns   moments sometimes so brief as to seem fleeting you shall   you will want to give this multiple viewings    it will take you time to decipher the story  but you will love every minute of it  dear filmmakers I have noticed a trend in television shows lately  the stories are being dragged out  I shall   I will get to the end of episode   or   and start to feel frustrated because nothing much has happened since the   episode  I shall   I will check the episode list and groan that a good story is being stretched across     episodes  however I am hooked  i need to know what happens  so i continue to watch  but i respectfully request that they be told more concisely  my family has developed a game of sorts to each give our opinion as to how many episodes the story could have actually been told in and inevitably  it is at least half  sharp objects is one of these shows that could have been told in half the episodes  easily  the acting was superb  the story interesting  but the pace was slower than a sunday afternoon  these are good shows  i e   goliath    season   the sinner  the oa  mindhunter  lost in space  and now sharp objects  just to name a few  they are worth watching  but i find them frustrating for plot points to be piecemealed out over so many hours  I am not asking the stories be told like the fast talking legal disclaimers at the end of an am radio ad  but just be tightened up a bit take the first season of stranger things  for instance  it was like an   hour movie where each episode advanced the story line at a very satisfying pace  i could not stop watching and gobbled it all up in one day   i love when all the episodes drop at once   the first and second season of bosch were like this as well  bingeing at its best  now i know this is my opinion and others will disagree with me  but it is a trend i have noticed over the past couple of years and maybe there are others out there who have noticed it too  this is my little two cents worth i find it strange to ask for less of a good thing  but that has   that is what I am asking  i want to watch shows that make me put down my laptop and phone  to make me stop playing games or surf the internet while the show is on  i wanna have to pause to discuss what just happened and look forward to watching more  instead  my reaction to last night s sharp objects was  yay  it has   it is the last episode and we can finally get some answers   the paint has finally dried i sound ungrateful  i know  this show and the others i mentioned are good tv  i thank you for the excellent programming  i just want it to be a little less    stretched thank you  a hats off to jean marce vallee  this is a masterpiece  i still did not get over from the finale  especially from the post credits scenes  this is far better than the brilliant big little lies by the same director  which was really good too  we cannot really decide who did their roles best  amy adams or patricia clarkson or eliza scanlen  they were absolutely stunning  a must watch for all  the love scene between john k and camille should be the clincher for award season  poignant  tender  and shows two humans connecting on a primal basis sharing and understanding each other s paincamille writes her pain on her body then hides it from everyone but john can see thru her guards since he has the same pain  this allows them to connect in a way she never could with detective powerful scene that deserves recognition  masterful in every single frame  if you liked true detective this might appeal to you as well  if you are looking for something to restore your faith in humanity you might want to watch something else  although this eight part hbo limited series has been advertised as a murder mystery  it has   it is really a character study  with the murder plot functioning primarily as an impetus to facilitate engagement with the characters surrounding it  nothing wrong with that  of course  the first season of true detective      still one of the finest seasons of tv ever made  worked as well as it did not because of the ostensible whodunnit  but because of the psychological deep dive into its two central characters  sharp objects is similarly interested not in who has   who is behind a pair of murders in a small missouri town  but in how those murders affect a trio of women caught up in the investigation  feminine in design rather than inherently feminist  the show is a portrait of tainted motherhood and corrupted sisterhood  and focuses on internecine inter generational conflict  matrilineal dysfunction  and how difficult it can be to escape from past trauma  but whilst the acting is exceptional  and the show is well directed and edited  much like the first season of big little lies      it left me wholly unengaged  completely uninterested in any of the characters  and fighting interminable boredom for much of its eight hours  it has   it is yet another example of one of the worst elements of prestige tv  series which are far  far longer than they need to be  sharp objects tells the story of camille preaker  an exceptional amy adams   a reporter for the st  louis chronicle  who is sent back to her hometown of wind gap  missouri to report on the murder of two young girls  a barely functioning alcoholic prone to carving words into her flesh  camille is ill prepared for the effect wind gap has on her psyche  central amongst her demons is her mother  adora  a spectacular patricia clarkson   who looks down on camille with barely concealed disappointment  camille is especially haunted by the memory of her younger sister marian  who died when they were still children  but in the years since camille moved away  adora re married and had another child  amma  eliza scanlen  in a breakout role   who fascinates camille with her dual personality   dutiful daughter from another era who wears elaborate dresses and plays with a doll s house  and roller blading lollypop sucking teenage temptress based on the   gillian flynn novel  sharp objects was written primarily by showrunner marti noxon and flynn herself  with directorial duties handled by jean marc vallée  who also helmed the aforementioned first season of big little lies  vallée was also lead editor  and this is important insofar as the editing is the show s calling card  as he attempts to draw us into camille s psyche via fleeting snippets of childhood memories  the editing rhythms will definitely throw some people off initially  with the frequent one second  or less  cutaways recalling oliver stone s  horizontal editing   however  a more apt comparison would be the free associative editing style of films such as hiroshima mon amour      zerkalo      and probably the best evocation of memory ever put on screen  distant voices  still lives      indeed  the technique is not entirely unlike marcel proust s use of  involuntary memory  in à la recherche du temps perdu   so  for example  adult camille lies in bed and stares at a crack on the ceiling and when we cut back to the bed  she has   she is a child looking at that same crack  adult camille is shown opening a door  and we cut to child camille entering a room  adult camille hears a song and closes her eyes  and when she opens them  she has   she is a child listening to the song on the radio this editing style inculcates us into camille s fractured mind  whilst also hinting at the nature of her trauma  without ever being too explicitly revealing  as will be discussed in a moment  vallée grossly overuses the technique  neutering it of its potency  but that notwithstanding  it has   it is a good example of the importance of  show  do not tell   as well as a great example of content generating form and form simultaneously giving rise to content  the memories are always tied to camille s fragmented psychology  with the brief snippets of recollection acting like splinters impinging on her adult existence another interesting aesthetic aspect of the show is its sense of place  taking place during a hot summer in which the entire cast are permanently sweating  one can practically feel the humidity rising from the screen and smell the pig farm on which so many of the town s people work  but it has   it is not just the sense of tangibility  at times  wind gap comes across as surreal enough to be the location of a david lynch film  the introduction to the town  for example  is a series of long tracking shots which show next to no people  as if the place has been abandoned  later we see amma and two of her friends perpetually roller blading around town like the   century equivalent of the moirai  we also meet a little boy who lives with his meth addicted mother and who carries a gun to ensure their safety thematically  the show covers a lot of ground  almost all of it tied to female experience  specifically motherhood daughterhood  adora is a woefully bad mother wh',\n",
       " 'o made little secret of the fact that she preferred marian to camille  when camille arrives at the house upon her return to wind gap  rather than be happy to see her  adora icily tells her   I am afraid the house is not up to par for visitors   in a rare moment of openness  as camille struggles to understand why adora treats her the way she does  adora tells her   you cannot get close  that has   that is your father  and it has   it is why i think i never loved you  you were born to it  that cold nature  i hope that has   that is of some comfort to you   later she admits that what she wanted from camille more than anything was the one thing camille could not give her   she wanted camille to need her in a more general sense  the show deals with how women respond to familial trauma  it does not engage with feminism at a political or cultural level  but it certainly does so at a personal level  arguing that the pain experienced by abused women is just as valid as that experienced by abused men  that the manifestations of trauma can be just as catastrophic  and that the anger engendered can be just as self destructive  we are very used to seeing stories focused on angry  damaged  hard drinking male characters with dark backgrounds who must fight to control the violence within them  but sharp objects is a story focused on the female equivalent of that trope  indeed  wind gap is a town where women are locked into the virtuous virgin rampant harlot binary  a binary created by men  it has   it is a place where a woman s worth correlates directly with her femininity  her maternal instincts  and her obedient acceptance of her place in androcentric societal structures   everything camille is not however  for all that  i could not get into sharp objects  and by no means did i enjoy it  the biggest problem is the pace  yes  i understand it has   it is a character drama  not a plot heavy murder mystery  but so too was the first season of true detective and never once did i feel that show was moving too slow  with sharp objects  as episode after episode after episode ended flatly  eventually i just stopped caring  aside from a major incident in the first episode  and a couple of big reveals in the penultimate and last episodes  almost nothing happens  and that has   that is not hyperbole  i mean it very literally  tied to this is that the show is far  far too long  the novel is   pages  and could easily have been adapted in a four episode run  but trying to stretch it out over eight  it runs   minutes  means that there are long periods were the narrative stops dead  with the characters not interesting enough to take up the slack  elsewhere  the flashback editing is used so often that it loses its potency and ends up feeling like filler designed only to artificially prolong the runtime  it also starts to feel like vallée is so in love with the technique that he has   he is using it arbitrarily rather than in the service of character or plot  additionally  the show abounds in clichés   from the alcoholic hard as nails journalist to the incompetent local police chief to the out of town detective to whom nobody listens to the gossiping women to the various suspects who are obviously red herrings  vallée also has a tendency to overuse certain images  thus robbing them of their effectiveness   amma and her friends roller blading around town  amma playing silently with her giant dollhouse  shots of the child camille being chased through the woods by a group of jocks  shots of camille filling a water bottle with vodka there has   there is a lot to admire in sharp objects  but precious little to like  although not exactly a work of post metoo fempowerment  it certainly has a female centric perspective  and its examination of issues usually associated with men is interesting  saying some fascinating things about female trauma  the performances are top notch and the editing is decent  albeit overused   but all in all  the show did little for me  i understand that it has   it is designed holistically rather than cumulatively  and i have no problem with that  but the pace is enervating and the characters just are not   am not interesting enough to fill such a lengthy runtime  i love gillian flynn because she writes about real women  fully fleshed out  gritty  strong  good bad and ugly  real women  i love amy adams and patricia clarkson because they convey that beautifully  i was really looking forward to the start of this miniseries because i so loved the book  and so far i am not disappointed  the cinematography and score are fantastic  and the acting is superb  it is a slow burn  as it should be  and it is in equal measure tense  taught  and hauntingly beautiful  i cannot wait to watch the rest of this story unfold  i do not read for pleasure very often  but after seeing the series i bought the book  and devoured it admittedly  the series feels to move slow  but at the end of every episode you are left thinking  what the      in the best possible way  and the pacing of the show just makes the ending that much sweeter and satisfying  great cast  and phenomenal performances from everyone  amy is incredible as usual  the best series I have seen in years  masterpiece    see until the last second  even in the final credits  wow  never felt so many awful feelings after seeing such an amazing show  wow it is raw and real in every sense  the script is finely performed by all the ensemble  and never insults the intelligence of the viewer  it always ends with me wanting to see more  i love everything about it  great atmosphere and soundtrack  very similar in tone and style to big little lies   also by director jean marc vallée  amy adams brings class and subtlety to what is not an especially original storyline  camille  a journalist haunted by ghosts of her past returns to home town to solve murder   but excellence of execution makes this shine  patricia clarkson s portrayal of camille s narcissistic  self absorbed mother is equally effective  you shall   you will find yourself wanting to choke her in every episode  also so refreshing to see women s lives and stories portrayed in a non exploitative way  camille s struggle with alcoholism and self harm is depicted with unblinking realism and is something many women can unfortunately relate to  looking forward to the rest of this series  which is shaping up to be as good as season   of true detective  highly recommend this  this is the type of show i want and need in my life brilliant acting  love patricia clark she is such a dear friend in my head  so talented and beautiful cant forget about the lovely eliza scanlen so skilled  this must have been such a great part to play and  come on amy adams i wanted to scoop you up and take care of you myself  the show proceeds with its own pace  and yet succeeds to keep us hooked  amy adams as camille preaker has displayed remarkable depiction of a girl who has battled self injuries all her life  her troubles feel real  which the actor portrays in a very convincing manner what makes the show successful and a quality watch is how well and deep it is textured  every conversation or scene  ordinary at the surface has a lot going on beneath  one begins to genuinely feel for camille and wonder why she faces the heat of her own mother  who appears to completely despise her the town  the townsfolk  the chitter chatter of the women   feels like a documentary on an american town  something for the international audience to experience and the final reveal on adora definitely comes unexpected and as a shock  there are scenes that are just difficult to watch  events difficult to believe the story ends and one begins to feel the makers are moving towards a patient finish  just like their show s style  but then comes the final twist   something few could have ever imagined  this series addresses the emotional and psychological trauma that can happen when you are dealing with an emotional over protective mother  a complacent father and multiple unsolved murders in small town missouri it keeps you on the edge of your seat until all is revealed and you never know what hit you amazing acting by all main characters and no spoilers here great series    hard to assign this series a number of stars  some aspects    others    the acting was stellar  making the characters believable in their almost unprecedentedly dysfunctional family crucible  and kudos to the way cinematography and editing created the most vivid  inside  view of the mental tortures of ptsd that i know of on film  paralleling the way that a beautiful mind put us inside the mental labyrinths of paranoid schizophrenia   for those commenters who have complained here about the erratic and incessant flashbacks  literally  flash  backs  and found them inexplicable  this would be my response  you were seeing a depiction of the manifestation of ptsd  imagine how anguishing then it is for an actual ptsd sufferer plagued by all such  cuts  and slices of trauma bombarding their mental visions  unrelentingly  but the artistry which achieved that depiction of ptsd is also a disjunct with the series ending where even more frenetic  barely visible cutting and slicing of flashes of violence    seeming to be in the same vein as camille s ptsd that we have been immersed into  racheted up in the splicings into the final credits as if on steroids  cannot serve the same purpose  in terms of the medium being the message  and thus left me with a sour end note as to director s choices  those mid closing  credits scenes were not illustrations of the workings of ptsd  they struck me  and my husband  instead as kind of cheap shortcut twists to stab us  the viewer with  so as to shake us up regarding what had seemed to be the series  final verdict on its crimes and punishments  those cinematic editing choices rode in on the backs of camille s ptsd depictions  so to speak  but they violated the exclusive use of those choices up to that point for illustrating ptsd  these could not plausibly  story perspective wise  be amma s ptsd  they were instead a break away into some  omniscient narrator  visuals  and while the series did put us into the pov of multiple characters  including amma  that never included entering into anyone else s but camille s ptsd flashback experience sensations so that attempted conflating of a use of a film editing  device  to illustrate ptsd and then in the last frames of the whole film to use that same  device  for some wholly other purpose was  for me  a sort of sabotage  and perhaps also a degree of disrespect for the story and or the viewer to relegate such a story twist to a barely recognizable insertion mid final credits  other films have deftly left us with final twists that  owned  themselves  for one thing by coming before final credits   films for example that leave us with some micro last minute filmed focus on a detail that changes everything  such as making us know that we had   we would been watching someone s dream rather than  reality     mulholland drive  and  take shelter  come to mind  their endings then became controversial fare for folks like us to debate as to what their ramifications and implications were for reframing the entire film s plotline  but that works  sharp object s post ending ending just felt shortchanged and inappropriate to the film s chosen form function schema  it also felt a bit cheap storytelling wise to have adora  in her very last extended scene with camille  segue into a bit of her own backstory to telegraph to the viewer that she came by her dysfunctions  legitimately  i e   handed down by her own mother to her  i would suspect that the novel did not wait until the last minute to weave that message into the telling  as an aside  viscerally  the hardest thing in the film for me was getting my mind around camille s cutting  most specifically  was she supposed to have engaged  at least sometimes in  collaborative cutting  à la tattooing  how could she have  achieved  those cuttings into her back  unlike tattooing  which is inherently social  cutting is a very isolationist dis ease  it felt disrespectful of the viewer not to give any kind of accounting for how those backside word cuts could have happened  thus leaving it in the realm of implausibility  the acting is best thing about this  the story is very slow and boring  constant flashbacks with no context are hard to interpret  make no sense  the camera is constantly shaking which gets more and more noticeable as the episode progresses  at the time of writing this has an     score  which simply cannot be true  i gave it a try but i definitely will not waste any more time on t']"
