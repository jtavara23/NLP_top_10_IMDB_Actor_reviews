       "\"what an excellent film by rian johnson definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. writing that is slick as hell sublime performances most notably daniel craig who brings his agame in a wonderfully charismatic turn superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music  all tied together by masterful direction. will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of agatha christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here  a nostalgically entertaining time nothing was typical about this. everything was beautifully done in this movie the story the flow the scenario everything.i highly recommend it for mystery lovers for anyone who wants to watch a good movie this is a movie one would not regret spending money on. after a long time i am rating a movie perfect  and this movie totally deserves it. i really like the subtle comedy sprinkled in the movie. it easies out the tense atmosphere. in a good detective movie you expect to be taken aback on how things unfold at the end and this is what happens in this movie. there is never an instant when you would get distracted or bored. i had a good time watching this movie and you would surely have it too. with the exception of my wife and daughter and possibly my mother agatha christie is the woman whom i love most on this planet. she truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays more than forty years after she passed away. there are still many adaptations of her original work but with knives out writerdirector rian johnson attempts something entirely different. it has  it is abundantly clear that johnson was inspired by all of christie's typical trademarks and hobbyhorses and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings but the plot of knives out is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. a good oldfashioned murder mysterywhodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets convoluted plot twists continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along and a fabulous allknowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.daniel craig is downright terrific as benoit blanc a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird oneliners hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch harlan thrombey. it looks like suicide but literally every greedy member of harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and  also in delightful agatha christie tradition  the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. it would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive compelling as well as humorous complex but simultaneously lightheaded and  entertaining. the cast is phenomenal. craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his james bond character and the thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents including jamie lee curtis michael shannon toni colette christopher plummer and don johnson. knives out is perhaps slightly too long but never tedious and very welldirected by rian johnson who honestly does not deserve all this hatred from disappointed star wars geeks as a fan of mysteries sherlock holmes poirot columbo monk psych.etc. i was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast figure you cannot go wrong. well i enjoyed it  while the cast all have time to shine it is daniel craig with his southern drawl  especially ana de armas that steal the show. for anyone keeping away because they hated the last jedi...i agree it was my least favourite of all the star wars films but this is a well written film that was well acted and i can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre. best movie of the year love everything about it what I am seeing is that some trolls that still cannot get over tlj now for those that have and give it a  well that has  that is fair but have some reasons why not just bc it has  it is rian johnson like stop it has  it is childish i enjoyed this a lot. clever interesting and plausible in its logic. i enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. i can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.some people might hate the politics of it but i thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. fox watchers will hate it which i can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.what can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. viewers go into the theater expecting too much.things never live up to the hype and this one did not live up to it for me. but i thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I am not sorry i spent some money on this one. let me start by saying that the film is good. it has  it is a solid murder mystery and I shall  I will make sure i watch knives out  when it comes out. all i kept hearing about this film was that it was hilarious and brilliant and 'so damn good' etc etc etc. i usually take these sorts of reactions with a grain of salt but having seen the trailer and seeing how great the cast was i bought into the hype. it looked so stylish so compelling.i really got my hopes up and i cannot help thinking i would have enjoyed the film far more if i had not been inundated with so many reviews heralding it as some brilliant masterpiece.i was expecting a lot of laughs and whilst i did laugh on occasion i did not laugh nearly as much as i was hoping i would. a film like this would have benefited from some black humor maybe rian could have cowritten the film wish a british comedy writer for some more quality laughs... phoebe waller bridge perhapsi enjoyed the scenes when the whole family was together and interacting with each other and i wish the film spent more time on them instead of opting for that ridiculous car chase and several other scenes that took me out of the whodunnit atmosphere.overall this film is a solid good time entertaining clever and well acted and written but in my opinion definitely does not live up to the hype. i have read the many glowing reviews for this film and i honestly do not get it. yes there were some very funny and entertaining parts. it was a very good ensemble cast. daneil craig does his best kevin spacey as frank underwood impression. but beyond that i found the cast woefully underused. jamie lee curtis don johnson etc. i expected jamie lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. she also as the daughter appeared to have no real motive for the murder. so the real crime here was her underuse.  of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. then when the murder was revealed at the half way point it was clear martha did not really do it and was being set up. chris evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines so the reveal for the most part is painfuly obvious or at least most of it. the giveaways were pretty obvious like granny saying random you are back again or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. the mention of the slayer law was very very obvious. i understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but should not there be at least some surprisesnor do i believe this is a commentary on our situation today. yes there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.that is not to say it is a bad film. daniel craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball. lots of kooky things happened. but i think this is better for a latenite netflix watch.i certainly do not see it as being best of the year. i went into this film with high expectations to say the least. i had heard so many good things about it so it was built up in my mind as this phenomenal murder mystery movie but it fell short. where do i begin daniel craig has this southern accent that just does not come across as convincing not annoying but not convincing. the main character of the film marta potrayed by ana de armas has this very unbelievable physiological condition in which she vomits every time that she tells a lie. i mean come on people. this vomiting 'tool' is used multiple times throughout the film to figure out the truth about some of the other characters in the story. let us just say that she vomits excessively until the credits start to roll.now the part of this film that really upset me was the 'big reveal' at the end. it is revealed at the end that detective benoit blanc knew about the blood stain on marta's shoe the whole time. the biggest issue with this reveal is why he did not ask her about it. he would have known her involvment in the murder the whole time. why did not he get the blood spot on her shoe tested that would have easily put her in the room with harlan when he died.overall the movie was entertaining up until we are revealed what happened between marta and harlan. once i found out how harlan died i started to lose interest. it basically lost the 'mystery' quality once that happened. the story went flat after that but then took off when new developments started to happen. the reason i give this movie a  is because i was able to figure out things about the story right away which left me disappointed and the blood spot made me question a majority of the movie. it was not a bad watch but i do not think i will be watching it again. being a middle aged englishman I have been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I have been spoilt. when the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. i was very excited having read the reviews that seemingly in the case of 'knives out' i would be getting a rare trinity of a good story good actors and good production. it certainly has two of the three. unfortunately this film thinks it has  it is cleverer than it is. it has  it is simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. rian johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'i am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who shall  who will listen. unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. with this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you had  you would not be any less aware of what has  what is happening. a bit of a shame really. I am a mystery lover and have seen and read every agatha christie tale. i found this movie very slow for the first half. second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit nor the charm and period atmosphere of a poirot episode which i can watch over and over  thank you david suchet and the other main actors. the lead actress was very attractive but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch as well as ridiculously unbelievable i guess that was the funny part. some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weatherbeaten. did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. the last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapidfire conclusion thank the lord. agree that daniel craig with that southern accent was just super annoying. great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat. over and over. it moved pretty slowly for me at times. i guess I am in a minority on this one. I am not saying it was terrible but it was not a great movie for me. mildly entertaining with a great cast and high production value. the story is soft but not awful. i cannot imagine saying this film deserves more than a . knives out uses a really old idea the whodunit. unfortunately contrary to what many claim there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern except some hipster dialogue and humor including a lot of throwing up by a specific character and some commentary on current social issues like the immigrant crisis and pointing fingers at the ultrarich which is ironic because the writerdirector of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in hollywood. the writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. in reality there not much cleverness here while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. most of the humor falls completely flat it is overlong  minutes twists are not surprising and do not really make sense. only bright spots daniel craig's amusing performance and the very talented ana de armas. other than that a semientertaining mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. a perfect example of an uninspired writerdirector with a complete lack of originality who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.personally i do not know much about star wars as i do not really follow popcorn franchises so i do not know what has  what is going on with this director and star wars. however it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house getting so much marketing hype and buzz while hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its' director. looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious oscar contender for multiple awards while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls  etc. I am confused. i say it has  it is nothing special and I am not a star wars fanatic. I have never even seen the film people are so angry about so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film knives out.i definitely expected more. if it has  it is meant to be amusing it pretty much failed on that score. this film would be better suited as a tv movie if they even make them anymore or something to pop up on netflix. i did not pay to see it and I had  I would feel I had  I would wasted my money if i had.visually it was enjoyablei mean the location the house the production values. the family members were an unattractive bunch so nothing to look at there. daniel craig's southern accent became grating after awhile and i was squirming a bit with boredom waiting for it to be over. and when it was my reaction was so what who cares i can hardly remember any of it and i just watched it in the last couple of hours.convoluted unrealistic and tedious like a lot of agatha christie stories. how this has ended up on some people's best films of  lists is beyond me. it was okay nothing special. knives out 🗡🚪💉💸rian johnson successfully revives the whodunnit mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time even if it does not bring anything groundbreaking to the table.knives out is the kind of whodunnit film that will never fail to entertain. as a progressive mystery knives out is a very fashionable movie with it has  it is grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. with some very snarky and slick writing these characters are albeit memorable most notably daniel craig's detective blanc and chris evan's ransome however the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. of course that never takes away from what else knives out has to offer. the intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion one could say murder on the orient express had a beautiful baby this being the result showing rian johnson's strongholds. while the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it has  it is footing upon the conclusion one for all and all for one.verdict knives out not only proves to us that rian johnson is a strong director with the right material but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways. general reviewgoing in i was expecting an energetic edgar wright feel and complex sherlock holmes mystery in which the audience tries to solve it at the same time. what i got was a cookie cutter 'mystery' that was different from others in its genre only in its use of bright colours rather than any sort of trope and convention subversion or parody.spoiler timein regards to acting christopher plummer ana de armas and chris evans gave great performances.  complaints for the main  i thoroughly enjoyed harlan and marta's scenes. there are more than  members of the cast of which i have complaints jamie lee curtis and micheal shannon among others gave performances that seemed to change personalities every few lines probably due to rian johnson's directing. don johnson was good lakeith stanfield was not others were mediocre or just less.special daniel craig section. daniel daniel daniel. what was that. the screenplay reads blanc ... speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have ever heard in your life. that is not what i was forced to listen to. the accent was very distracting and i could only hope for a case of stockholm syndrome that never came. his character was meant to act as an absurdist archetype satire of the noir detective but instead he came across as an annoying detective who did not diverge from the archetypal role. if that did not bother you then it would have been a good performanceas mentioned i was expecting more edgar wrightesque editing and cinematography that the trailer promised me.overall the writing is very basic being a typical murder mystery. i am unsure if you can even call it a murder mystery when you find out the truth a quarter through. throughout the story there were many setups with minimal or no payoff e.g. shoe blood where is marta from harlan should have commented to ransom during their fight where she is from. there were also too many inconsistencies like how the stairs did not actually make a noise every time some people went up with a noise and down without because rian johnson forgot.for the final reveal marta must be especially talented to feel tincture and viscosity of vials a quality you might be able to feel when you are drawing a syringe but she had made the choice already which solution to use maybe density or weight would be acceptable but the given explanation of her being such a good person that her vail choice was correct is pretty dumb. also the shots for fran's last words were different where she said you did this in the scene and first flashback but hugh did this in the last. these  issues detract from the fun of watching murder mysteries in which an audience should be able to find the killer if they have been paying attention instead the script pretended like you should have known these facts.the suspect game instead was played by cast knowledge. by looking at the cast you can see it has  it is either jamie lee curtis micheal shannon or chris evans personally i guessed micheal shannon due to his typecasting but when i realised that all  of harlan's children where the same character with different jobs it was then obviously the built up character named ransom. ransom. his name is ransom.this leads me to one of my main critiques unnecessary characters. despite all  of harlan's children being the same the nazi kid served  purpose that could have easily been delivered by another character the granddaughter katherine langford served a whopping  purposes that all together could have been dropped and exchanged. there were  cops and blanc for some reason of which the comedic policeman was not funny.lastly too many convenient devices like the stairs that made a noise 'every time' marta vomiting when she lies the dogs choosing to like and dislike people or the various murder mystery cliches that excuse themselves through being self aware secret doors and prop knives i actually wish  would do away with the starrating portion of their website because it does not give an accurate rating for films and this film is a perfect example. everyone knows that there are many bitter star wars fanboys rating this film low because they are still so bitter over rian johnson's the last jedi and as a result they are going to try to ruin any of rian's future films. they really need to just get over it and get a life already. do not believe the starrating of this film because it has  it is mostly from bitter star wars fanboys rating the film low on purpose obviously. anyone who has actually seen this film would be braindead to rate it low or to not give it a good review because this film is so freaking entertaining i could see it again and again. it has  it is so different than the crap that has been in the theaters lately. it has  it is fun it has  it is thrilling it has  it is wacky it has so many twists and turns that it always keeps you guessing. and for the cast what a freaking cast i could not even tell you who the mvp of the cast was. they were all fantastic. we need more films like this and less big explosions stupid plot films. i for one will give this the true starrating it deserves  bitter star wars fanboys you can keep being immature and rating it low but it is not going to change the fact that the film is great and I am going to encourage every single person to go out and see it pronto when it hits theaters generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery tv shows than movies this is partially since it has  it is hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time.this movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects. it has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details midmovie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute.the acting was brilliant and i did not feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage. have to say i was a little disappointed by this not because it is not good. arguably it is but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good which it is not. so as with so many films your experience  enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.overall i think nearly everyone will enjoy this particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated cgi. having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of hollywood. one of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath but not always beneath the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it has  it is difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie which without giving too much away it ultimately does.what is genuinely enjoyable is daniel craig's slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match. the rest of the cast features some big names but unfortunately as others have pointed out they do not always have that much to do. jamie lee curtis and toni collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is don johnson.the plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all and while it has  it is quite good it is not that good or that original. the key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable for the record i did not work out who did it but did work out the mechanism involved. if one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement knives out falls somewhat short. a part of the problem is that for much of the film it is not clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place. in the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister.perhaps the best aspect of the film aside of daniel craig was the fact that the johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy  the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller. I shall  I will probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I had  I would have to say i probably enjoyed adam sandler  jennifer aniston's murder mystery more than this including with regard to the solution. knives out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it  or anyone else I had  I would venture  thinks it is. still enjoyable though really boring for the most time. lots of wasted potential. i do not understand the nomination and positve reviews. it has  it is just an ok movie. a missed opportunity to do something better. the movie plays like the worst episode of columbo you have ever seen only this time it features daniel craig attempting to imitate foghorn leghorn. learn from my mistake and avoid this turkey. others have mentioned the old house might have held some secrets it did not. or that it might present a more structured whodunit that leaves you guessing it did not. or that the main character might offer a bit of verve cleverness or pizazz that might have livened up the whole affair she does not at all.i also take some issue with the director's choices in scene framing especially in the beginning. there should have been more closeups and better initial intros for each character's little idiosyncrasies so we would could warm up to them. i simply do not care for how it was shot it has  it is terribly pedestrian. the fast quick edits of the trailer are totally absent there has  there is something missing here. todd solondz tim burton or the cohen brothers really could have drawn these characters out more and given the actors something real to work with.i thought it would sparkle with a bit more witty dark humor. it was not quite as funny or snappy as i was expecting it to be. instead it settles on delivering more of a message about this girl who does good while the others do bad.there has  there is also no need for daniel craig's poor southern accent. he should have just done a british accent it would have been fine and enjoyable maybe given the film a bit more weight it seems it was shooting for in the end with its messaging.additional viewings might reveal there has  there is more to it but i suspect such might reveal there has  there is less. a stella cast carrying a whodunit will depend entirely on the story... sadly instead of the plot thickens it thins out unbearably...overall the movie was entertaining enough to watch... but the plot was stretched a little thin and the ending was disappointing...a whodunit works by bringing the audience along to try to figure out the crime and be pleasantly surprised at the big reveal... this movie decided at the half way point that it no longer wants to be a whodunit and we no longer should follow along as it does its own thing... sigh...i would not recommend this to anyone who truly enjoy the genre..spoiler alert...let us tackle the minor annoyances first... the beginning sets everyone out as having a motive to murder... standard for the genre but here it stops there...no building up of everyoneanyone who also had the opportunity to commit the murder... motive without opportunity does not add up to murder...this means... before the middle of the story we have already eliminated almost everyone as the suspect... which kinda defeats the whodunit plotline... having a girl who is a witness who vomits if she lies is extremely convenient for a murder detective... and... surely any investigator will target her for as much information as possible...here however to preserve the big reveal later i guess they let her off without ever really questioning her...even ransom got more information than the investigators did...in fact the detectives were more interested in talking to benoit and kept telling her to go away after finding out this rather beneficial condition...this leaves a feeling of a weak plot that cannot exclude her from some crucial events...she did not have to witness the suicide... which in itself did not add anything to the story... and with that she could spill the beans on what she did and we can all still believe there was further foul play involved... marta and benoit find the hidden tox report after spending hours to chase it down... yet they can sit down to have a chat after finding it but neither even opened it to take a lookthis gives us the scene where she was about to confess in front of the whole family but was stopped in mid sentence... dramathat has  that is ridiculous and again feels forcedfalse... walt confronts marta at her home... he evades the horde of reporters and came in via the back way...firstly a rich guy like him would likely never have to use the back way and would not be able to find one...secondly walt is the 'boss' of a printing empire and it has  it is unreasonable that nobody in the media recognises him...thirdly he walkslimps with a cane...is he really the best person to go seek marta out under the circumstancewould not meg donna or jacob be better suited for the stealthrequired  captain frigging america... emm i mean ransom... when he left and came back would not that be recorded in the early part of the surveillance video he stopped exactly where she stopped...ok this one maybe i can accept the reason is he knows the area well and was able to evade detection... still unsatisfying though... fran wants to confront ransom believing he killed harlan...a woman confronting a mankiller even if he has  he is not captain america surely would not choose an abandonedcreepy location to meet..what does she think will happen this is not a slasher flick where dumb teenagers go into the room despite multiple warnings not to... harlan was in a terrible rush to kill himself...marta explained that he will die in minutes... and at around the  minutes mark he will sweat profusely and have some other symptoms...would not a normal person wait until the symptoms start to show before reaching for the knifemany more minor niggles like benoit not needing to introduce himself before sitting inside the house witnessing all the 'interrogations'... there seem to be no other maids or servants in such a huge well maintained house that needed to be questioned... marta just happens to have a large magnet in her pocket for erasing a video tape... nobody who was not around needs to have an alibi for their whereabouts...none of the other detectives see the blood stain on marta's shoe...too many roll eyes moments for a whodunit plot...now...let us get to the parts that killed the moviestory... benoit doing his best poirot... and gave too much details without any evidence...examples...he could simply say ransom switched the medication.. but instead he goes into details of how he sucked out medication from one bottle and then from the other bottle... how would he know thathow did he deduce that it was ransom who sent him the cashhow can he be so sure that a person with dementia simply did not mix up 'back' and 'back again'... very thin even if we can accept the inference...if he has  he is wrong at any point ransom could stop him and the story telling ends...these plus some other details he brought up without any evidence shows that he is just showboating and not very professional... he should be more mindful of his reputation... and this goes against his persona of being careful with what he says as shown in the beginning... the claim is that ransom torched the examiners' office the night before... and yet in the morning light actually around  already... and the fire on that notlarge building seem to just get going... in real life it should be ashes before daylight... unless it was touched an hour or two before ...since ransom was with marta in the morning he could not have done it... we were told that overdose of morphine means dying in  minutes...when marta found fran ransom was in police custody and there was nobody else around... she should be the prime suspect...and obviously ransom could not have done that too... in the scene where she makes her escape after the will reading...the family could not stop her if she wanted to drive away... richard said something like what do you want me to do bite the bumperto stop her leaving...... but when she came out of the car push through the crowd to get into ransom's car not a single person stopped her getting in...this is of course essential for her to spend quality time with ransom... totally unrealistic...in conclusion...as said... not bad entertainment  but a terrible whodunit ... so around . overall... this movie has an identity crisis it cannot decide if it has  it is a thriller mystery drama comedy or romance as a result it has  it is somewhat of a mess and difficult to sit through. it has  it is a shame because the acting is really good the script just cannot keep up. both the male and female leads were superb. very talented actors who have huge careers ahead of them. the film was okay. his character was interesting. but the way he filmed guests was a little unbelievable and did not make sense. but i could ride with that. the story was a gentle run but with nothing of note to remember. i probably would not watch it again but i will be keen to see both the actors in something new. i recommend this film for a relaxed afternoon. oh and i think helen hunt is in it. or someone who looks a bit like her. it has  it is rare you i find a movie i watch all through let alone recommend to anyone with that in mind if you want to see a movie that is well acted has a story that keeps your interest is not predictable and has twists in the tale you will find this worth a watch as a minimum. this one is a head scratcher....and by head scratcher i mean after the film is over you will scratch your head wondering why anyone would sign onto this movie. to say that the story was poorly conceived would be a an understatement. the movie goes absolutely no where and ultimately you are left with a feeling of regret for how you chose to spend the last hour and a half of your lifethe good  tye sheridan's performance as a high functioning man with asperger's  seeing john leguizamo in something since john wick chapter  and a briefly topless ana de armasthe bad  everything elsetldr skip this one for sure see past the crime movie see past the thiller see past the hollywood. this movie was great with  incredible actors. if people do not understand deeper meanings and symbolism. do not watch it. the problem with 'the night clerk' and I have seen many films fall into this trap is that it gives itself a really annoying lead character for the audience to have to follow and side with. now there are two sides to that coin. one is that the character is unique and interesting to watch from a medical point of view and that has  that is why the movie puts him there. but the other side of that coin is that it becomes really frustrating and hard to watch very quickly. it gives the film a point of difference but a point of difference for the sake of it is not always enough.tye sheridan does a fantastic job playing the lead role. he nails aspergers syndrome. before it was ever mentioned in the film i was  certain that was what i was looking at. he keeps it up for the entire movie and never drops a scene either. the other cast member who really impressed me was ana de armas. i came to learn of her acting talents in 'knives out' and she has impressed me again here. she did not have anything overly special to do in the film but you could still tell she was a class above the rest.the film itself is a little obvious in what it is trying to set up and surprise the audience with. there has  there is one scene in particular that they thought they were being subtle with but in reality it put all the cards on the table and gave the game away. also there is a mystery element of sorts to the film that had it been handled differently could have been really interesting. instead it was just clunky and petered out to dust by the end. i think the thing to watch this film for is sheridan's performance and as a character study of an aspergers syndrome. otherwise there is not a whole lot going for it. before watching any movie I had  I would always set lower expectation for the movie and it usually pays off. this movie is like that. you have to know what you are getting into and you must know what your expectation.if you expect full blown mystery thriller like primal fear prepare to be disappointed. but if you expect something to pass your free time with a short linear mystery thriller this is the movie for you.the plot is quite monotonous with the only twist was at the end but it is what I am expecting by reading the synopsis. it has  it is about an mc who have an asperger syndrom accused of murder. the focus is not whether he did it or not because i think it is pretty self explanatory during the scene. if you as many people expect this as the main focus of this movie again prepare to be disappointed. it is about how the mc want to prove that he has  he is innocent without the help of police how he trapped all who has  who is involved or related to the murder that want to set him up but actually he know's all along and how he set them up again.all in all it has  it is not really that bad. i truly could not wait for this crap to end. first off you got a hotel employee with asperger with hidden cameras in the rooms watching guest and it just so happens he witnesses a domestic violence incident this was just so wrong on so many levels i do not even know where to start. the minute the screen on my tv faded to black i came here to warn you all that this was utterly time wasted. i so do not recommend it. the night clerk is socially awkward yet not very convincing as a person with asperger's syndrome. the story is dull predictable and plods along at a snail's pace. the poor acting of the lead the silliness of the script and bad editing all combines to make this film difficult to watch through to the end. very amateurish. no idea why they made this movie. it was slow boring and predictable which is a kinder way of saying stupid. its a film about autism spectrum disorder a young man with high but ever so locked up mental capasity who has vast compications connecting to other åeople. working as the night clerk at a hotel he feels that he can control and surveil the environment and as part of his self therapy uses hidden cameras in the hotel rooms just to practice how to interact with people especially the female part of the guests. but as a crime occurs on his night watch things become very dire for him.its a strange study into the head of a complicated person. its kinda rainman feeling rendering you while watching at the same time its not. there are some confussionin the plot the characters are pretty undeveloped and its hard to say what reaaly happened in the end..seems to me they were in a hurry to get an end to the storyit could have been much better....the grumpy old man gives a  for the main cast its a small recommend and a joyridee if youre in the trade of working peoples heads.. predictable or not i found the acting great and the story a bittersweet reminder of how naive we used to be as well or perhaps still are sometimes. after reading the other users reviews i was kinda of demotivated to watch this movie. fortunately i did watch it and it was a good moviewith a capital m. it was not hard to watch at all and it kept my attention throughout.i highly recommended it. this movie was not bad slow but interesting. but the end so rushed. it spoiled the whole movie what happened how why tye sheridan really impressed me with his portrayal of a man with asperger's. he is very convincing from the lack of eye contact to his mannerisms. the story itself is a little slow and lacks an emotional climax. i have no idea why i watched this till the end when it was annoying me within  minutes. tye sheridan plays a night clerk with aspergers in a motel. i do not know anyone with this affliction but i do know his character was driving me nuts and his acting came across as forced and phony. the story is preposterous i thought this was suppose to be a thriller but it has  it is just an extremely boring and drawn out drama about him trying to cope and in a back story there is a murder. it has  it is just nonsense with uninspired performances and dialogue scenes that go on so long you shall  you will be nodding off and towards the end what was boring became confusing and ridiculous in fact i had no idea what was going on. ana de armas is very beautiful but she needs to avoid crp like this if she wants a long term career. this is complete hollywood made for television garbage using a real mental condition to wring some sympathy from a bad script with a ludicrous plot. what were any of these people thinking how did anyone show up on the second day of filming i loved every minute of this movie.. the acting were superb especially tye sheridan's.. the brief romance between ana de armas's and tye at the swimming pool was really heartwarming. and lastly i didnt see the ending coming. it fooled me alright. artsy was defeated by slow  dismal the actors did their part but the writers and editors failed tremendously. slow movie but the acting was alright. the two lead actors were average but did well for a movie with a dull script love this movie. great acring great place. worth a watch. i really tried to like it but the more time passed in the movie the worst it got. the only quality of the movie was the acting of the male lead. the female lead was actually a pretty bad in my opinion. her acting was not believable and came off a bit annoying. the script was simply terrible and all over the place. and the worst part was that almost everything about this movie was predictable. a boring and badly written movie. i only commend tye sheridan and john leguzamodetective in all of this. yes that statement made you think more and had more twists and turns than this whole movie. at least you have a  chance of having some fun when you see a balloon knot as compared to the  crap you get with this thing. only this slower than this movie a one legged giraffe on a skateboard. tye sheridan's acting was exceptionally excellent ee brilliant mate. top work i understand tye most likely studied his art in depth and it shows here. plus john leguizamo wow you owned the role and so lovely that you were a good rough cop. who also respected the disorders or orders of autismthank you guys for making this great acting with great writing and directinga must watch good cast and nice narrative buildup slowly brewing. works fine. blade runner  is a continuation of 's blade runner a seemingly impossible task. against all odds and logic the movie pulls it off.the good the greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. without delving into spoiler territory blade runner  concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. there are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. the idea of keeping the cold war and old iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. blade runner  does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. it does not wink at the fears of today's audience. it is its own selfcontained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.the acting is strong across the board with harrison ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film and looking fit to boot. also ana de armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. a truly starmaking turn.the bad a combination of a long running time a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. i confess a strong ending brought me back into the film it was losing me for a while there.in conclusion this movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. it seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing see leisurely pace above. blade runner  pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films jared leto. in many ways it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. a triumph. wow this was terrible and cliched.really if you have no ideas reason or script just.skip.it.i woke up long enough to feel sorry for a suffering dog but that is about it. where is the action where is the crescendo where is the meaning what replicants can now give birth so they are not replicants anymore and can be considered bona fide humans so what is the morale of all of this pros beautiful to look at beautiful women cool technology cons slownothing is resolved boring script dialogue and lines typical sequel a shadow of its prequel they really should become more judicious in picking which movies need a sequel and if they do that  of sequels will never come to be and the focus will shift towards developing new ideas. for film fanatics like myself blade runner  is a great film for people to see regardless if they have witnessed the original or not. on the other hand if you have never seen the original blade runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an actionpacked thrill ride then I had  I would have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. it has  it is very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details but that has  that is exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. for nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie here is why blade runner  is a must see as soon as possible. before dropping you into this world with ryan gosling's character there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past but even though that information is given to you your experience just will not be the same without having viewed the first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it. set out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story ryan gosling's character who will remain nameless for the sake of this review uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past inevitably involving rick deckard. quite honestly that has  that is the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience so let us get technical. if not for anything else blade runner  benefits from some of the best cinematography I have laid my eyes on in years. from the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects to the mind blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department i have nothing but praise for this film. whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience the visuals alone should have you applauding due to their incredibly detailed nature. i personally found the overall film to be magnificent but when certain scenes were dialoguefree and asking you to gasp at the imagery that has  that is exactly what i was doing as i feel many audiences members will. again without giving anything away once rick deckard harrison ford enters the picture the way both films sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion. it does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process. with a terrifically restrained performance by ryan gosling you shall  you will find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall as he uncovers these mysteries. with the addition of harrison ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances as well as ana de armas in a role that really took me by surprise this film was casted to the nines from beginning to end. some may complain about jared leto and dave bautista not being included as much but i felt as though the served the story quite nicely. in the end this movie aims to impress scifi fans across the world but i feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made are those who have had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is 's blade runner. i do not say this about films very often especially when talking about sequels but i have not been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time. this is definitely a superior film than the original it has  it is one of the best films of  and I shall  I will be revisiting it very soon. blade runner  is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across the world and every bit of it is deserved. aside from being very long this is pretty much a perfect film if you do not try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that are not  am not blatantly answered. if you know what type of film you are in for or you have at least seen the original and enjoyed it i cannot recommend this movie enough. just slomo 'acting' and movements with insider jokes to pretend they are clever.could someone point out why this blade runner and this blade runner exist no did not think so.ps compare the music with this accounting ledger balance sheet line item with vangelis' original. stars for the poor and cute dog.over and out. blade runner  of course came with its own expectations and a bar that was set quite high. i was drawn in by the promise of that universe the graphics and the giant holographic woman and was not disappointed. the cgi and the building as well as the beautiful women were what i expected. i wish i had a 'wife' that pretty.unfortunately again the bar was set high but this film did not deliver. there are too many loose ends and the film does not give the audience a conclusion. the major surprise regarding replicants and what they can do is also a bridge too far. i do agree that the film is slow which coupled with the lack of a conclusion brings my rating down. not only it went against the prequel's story but also it left the door open for another film. nothing happens in this after all. all they did is take our money put us to sleep very likely and tell us to come back and give them more money for the inevitable sequelfranchiseuniversevomit.here are things hinted at but not resolved dystopia army child birth successor corporate corruption and of course lovers' relationship.do not give it your money. three stars for the girlfriend's eyes hair thighs and home cooking. mainly because i fell asleep. why is this film so boring i mean aside from a menage a trois scene where the girlfriends are actually worth looking at everything else not only transpired so slowly it made little sense as well.why anything on screen is happening boggles the mind. ask yourself why any of the narrative is of consequence and there is a blank page as an answer. that is saying much in a film that tries to be profound. the rest  starsboringwell it is a sequel after all what did i expectanyway this makes no sense the girl is hot but i do not understand the point of the film when the replicants are not replicants anymore. let me describe the sequence of blade runner  for youhere goesenter the cinema with an overpriced orange juice that is mandatory because in the last couple of years hollywood has decided it is artsy and de rigueur to make films longer than  hours. the lights dim and commercials kick in for  minutes. a game for preteens wasting daddy's money on mobile phones and plans kicks in.  minutes of endorsements for gm trucks with some guy whose tone is so macho i roll my eyes follows. then there is a reminder to get the right debit card to be hip and in. then the film follows for a whopping  hours almost. you would think that there was a lot happening and we were kept excited. alas the only thing that kept me awake was the very periodical appearance of a beautiful eye candy whether real hologram or laser show version that would keep things exciting.if it were not for the sexy and lovable women blade runner  was inane. yes inane. apparently not every film needs a sequel a lesson hollywood did not learn from hangover.the script was so corny and the words so elementary one would be excused for thinking this is a practical joke. head of police yes head of police is told a big lie by a contractor head of police believes it and all is good. no double checking no verifying no details asked no proof required. it is a matter of life and death for the order of the world and of ok let us keep rolling guys. the ending was also a joke. a vehicle is drowning and the hero is being drowned but in the last second kills the bad gal and swims back to the vehicle to mount a rescue for the sequels that will follow. replicants can have and make babies but how oh well watch the prequel blade runner rogue uno which is coming out in .at that point all i wanted in life was to buy my own joi and luv and go back home. .... is only second to american remakes of foreign movies. when hollywood remakes international movies my house begins to stink.with that said sequels are a close second and this socalled blade runner shows why. in other words blade runner  is contradictory pretty holographic wife cooking meals and showing skin... yeah earth sucks now take that off worlders... yeah what a hell hole and just a cash cow. ridley scott has finally ran out of different video versions of the original to release and people are sick of the alien prequels and sequels he kept pushing out they all sucked and so he has  he is back here.get some integrity. my goodness how can you expect an audience to sit through three hours of mind numbing slowmo contradictory conversations that make no sense and expect people to pay for the privilege.i guess we should have known better since it is a sequel.all that rescued this film was several hard body super thin flaunting babes. yup those ashamed of the human body nature and heterosexuality should stay away too. otherwise without the chicks the film would be a complete bust. the force awakens   mr sandman the lullaby   blade runner . i still was bored. i am referring to the thin eye candies. the girlfriend and hooker were positively femininely beautiful and worth the price but this is not a good movie. outside the slender and flaunting body of the eye candies it quickly descends to boredom. i just kept rewinding to check out the actresses. otherwise zzzz first they make a film to put us to sleep. it is boring slow tedious and quite sleepinducing. we fall asleep and catch up on some much needed rest.then the 'music' is a series of farts and tears and explosions and keeps waking me up. look either get a soundtrack with music or skip it. what is with all the hi tech special effects' sounds instead of music i read that ridley scott likes to produce more of these. please do notterribleit was so boring. i cannot believe they thought anyone would get through this overlong movie in a dark environment like a cinema. perhaps that is why they had the 'soundtrack' which was mostly explosive rip tears and screeches instead of music to wake us up.i did enjoy the dog the pretty girlfriend and the prostitute. involving a couple of flaunting babies but otherwise this film is stupid. do you remember the criticism of the prequel where rachel and deckard ride into the sunset on a glorious road amidst beautiful nature right. here too you can live in opulance in a casino and drink free whiskey and even have your own cute dog etc.snore. what can i tell you sequels. the set design is fantastic the girls are sexxxy and i love dogs. the poor dogis it trendy in hollywood to not employ editors and have the film go on and on and on and on what has  what is more it is a sequel. more about making money than creating a story. .. to come to think this is a good movie.the pretty women and fantasy are welcome and certainly a pleasant rarity in these antihuman body times but this sequel yup the problem right there is boring and should not exist.it is forced too long and the contrast to its prequel damning. hollywood needs to stop making these meaningless sequels. they are for losers and only made for cash hoarding because if hollywood was lacking cash it would not pay all these notalents in the millions. at least this was not antiwoman and antifemale and the women were hot and thin.they could have easily done a modern film where all the women are in baggy jump suits and obese and expect us to love it but at least they did not hate on slender and attractive women. that has  that is something these days.of course it was a sequel and it was stupid and made little sense. i also have to say it is time for ford to retire. do you know why this is the worst sequel ever aside from the crappy sequels from disneynot only it is too overlong and boring it also makes it beautiful prequel become less attractive to the viewers. that is criminal. sure the keywords on imdb point out the chicks are pretty but that is not enough justification for more sequels or remakes.hollywood not every film needs a sequel. stop. blade runner  is not a good film but it is not a complete disaster. a story that did not need telling and logically failed an overlong and slow moving narrative and a massacre that makes no sense any longer were countered by original visuals and beautiful women. i will go with a rating of .the problems with this film is that it has sequeltitis. they came up with it because they needed to make money from a sequel and have no original ideas.the massacred are peaceful and are farming. why do it then the story moves so slowly that the  hours seem like . the acting is not good but moderna ctors cannot touch older ones so that is par for the course. when in the original the performance by the chief of police his goon the industrialist and the eye maker would rivet and excite or the strong personality of the replicants would make the blood boil here it is a paint by the number series of appearances.with that said the futuristic society is fun to watch. even more fun is ana de armas the sexy and delicious hooker and even the legs of the chief who is old so has short hair unfortunately. these babes add to the vista and architecture that is most pleasing to the eye in this sequel. what was the point of this film it was not entertaining it was slow and it was sleepinducing so there must be a plot or morality instead right wrong.they are retiring peaceful and oppressed replicants while at the same time making even more.confused yetyuplet me give you the reason why they needed this film. hollywood needs sequels like donald trump needs porn stars with std. period. it is a disease and addiction for the weak.ps i asked my wife if she is into a menage a trois for us and said said no but i know she was watching with interest so at least this film gave us an opening. i am leaving you. we are done. your endless sequels and franchise movies are boring and uninspired. frankly forgive my crudeness they all suck.you think bringing a couple of sexy babes into our lives will save our marriage. they do not. i watch the chicks but i still know that you are boring and the fire and passion are gone.take care. after being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians  most notably bohemian rhapsody rocketman and rolling thunder revue a bob dylan story  it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict though desirable biographical approach. that is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous i came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of the beatles and their music through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all. quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing.on another level the film made a satire of the modern music industry. it revealed how the apparent solo artists are far from their titles with huge teams of people pushing them in a preferred and more commercial creative direction taking the musicians' creative power. this was done in a humorous light as most themes are presented in the film. the romantic aspect of the film is evident from the beginning and is a dominant aspect of the story possibly shifting the focus of the piece a little too much. however it still helps provides a satisfying ending.the film pays a great amount of respect in a fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts. refreshingly original and entertaining. the story flows and the characters are relatable and well developed. not what i expected from the trailer but i liked it better than what i expected. so nice to see someone take a chance on an original story. the original premise of the movie was fantastic  only one man knows that the beatles ever existed and brings their music to the world.it could have been really really great. unfortunately the idea was under developed it felt as if the film's makers were not quite sure what to do with it.it ended up being nice and sweet when it could have been brilliant. i went into this wondering if they were going to explain the whole premise with it being a dream or such was he going to get caught and crucified for it was he going to get the girl lose the girl so many movies are fixated on realism and difficulties and negativity. yes he faces several difficulties. but the movie is light and beautiful with fantastic music. if i want realism i watch a documentary. this is what i go to the movies for. really well done there are some movies that when released simply do not need a big marketing campaign. just a few words of description of the plot are enough to put it on your must see list a struggling musician has a cycling accident during a freak global blackout and wakes to a world where noone other than him remembers the beatles or any of their songs. when i heard this i said to myself yes yes yes but would it live up to my expectationsthis is a richard curtis penned film and that has  that is immediately enough to put a tranche of moviegoers off. all his movies have an accent on the uplifting the positive andor the whimsical and i can understand why that winds some people up. if richardcurtissy was an adjective and i think it should be many of these films can be so classified.here although again very richardcurtissy i think he gets the mixture just right.... yesterday for me was a complete joy from beginning to end.i imagine curtis getting this story from a rowdy dinner party round his gaff. he asks his guests over the third bottle of dessert wine to play a wild and fantastical what if game in pursuit of the very good spare brownie of course. at this particular event i guess it was costoryauthor jack barth in his moviewriting debut that made the successful attempt to hog the brownie. for the premise of yesterday is quite brilliant whilst at the same time being utterly bonkers toothat being said the story is not completely original. i thought there were many similarities to the ricky gervais vehicle of  the invention of lying where gervais alone finds he suddenly has the ability to tell lies and finds illgotten fortune and fame as a result. much like that earlier film much of the joy here is in the recognition of the gift given and the dawning realisation of what this might actually mean to him. as such i found the first half of the film a lot more enjoyable than the second.the conundrum facing jack is to remeber all of the beatles songs and their lyrics without having google as a reference and much fun is had with him stumbling into situations that suddenly remind him of a new track or a particular snatch of lyric.there is of course an obvious explanation for the whacky storyline since the hero has received a potentially serious head injury. but would the film go there no spoilers here.himesh patel is from tv's eastenders but here makes his movie debut. he is perfectly cast as jack malik in the film he has  he is a name about to rise from utter obscurity as a lowestoft retail assistant to global superstardom. patel is charming and believable as he squirms with his conscience. a surprising and touching beach scene in the final reel of the film is exquisitely acted.the everwatchable and utterly gorgeous lily james here goes brunette she was actually unrecognisable to me from both the trailer and the poster here she makes a very believable highschool teacher with a sideline in management and roadieing.i found ed sheeran's cameo in bridget jones baby to be excruciating but here in what is quite an extensive part he is much much better. i think he has  he is been getting lessons.one of the slight disappointments with the film is that it is a danny boyle film that does not feel like a danny boyle film. aside from some inventive onscreen titles i did not detect much of the stylisation that i would expect from one of his films. yes there are occasional flashes of genius  for example the scenes where malik is desperately trying to remember the lyrics of eleanor rigby and those of him watching big screen his own socialmedia led rise to super stardom. but otherwise the visuals and storyline are pretty linear in nature.although there are cloyingly gooey bits of this film the element that weaves it all together  such that all is forgiven in my book  is the magical music and lyrics of mccartney lennon and harrison.was there a better year to be born that  well possibly the mid to late 's so you were old enough to remember more of it. but although only a child aged between two and nine during their album releases i felt the benefit of three older siblings who were able to fully embrace beatlemania. and the film delights with its modern day recreations of the classic tracks and as already mentioned himesh patel belts them out wonderfully especially i thought with help.i cannot not give this one  stars. i simply loved it and cannot wait for its general release in the uk on june   so i can go and love it all over again. is it technically a  film possibly not but sometimes you just have to go with the way a film makes you feel not just as you walk whistling out of the cinema but for the whole of the next  hours and i suspect longer. in summary he loves it. yeah yeah yeah yeeeeeaaaaaah.this is an edited version. the full graphical review is available on one mann's movies on t'internet or facebook. please consider checking it out. thanks it was a great idea and in some ways the film made the vision work. i just do not think they did enough with it though and instead fell back into the traditional love story formula. the music helped carry a lot of it through unsurprisingly. what they missed was it was not necessarily the songs themselves but the era in which they came out and the meaning of the time. movie just presented it as almost instant stardom if today's world heard the songs which lets be honest today's generation would not understand half of it. it did not really present a clear vision of why which i was looking for towards the end to help tie things up. lights go off on the planet he takes a bump on the head then the beatles never existed alternate universe dream thought there would have been something more there. there were a few things that bothered me with the story that the movie made it seem like they were pieces to the puzzle but then never did anything with them. first is through the film he also finds out other things do not exist as well such as coke cigarettes the band oasis and harry potter. it seemed like these things were going to connect into the story and why the beatles music is not present but they just left it there and he kind of says oh well and nothing comes of it. the second was he finds out there are two others that also know the beatles music and again seems like this should be a big part of the story to tie things together as to a bit of why but they just have a conversation about it she gives him an address and then that has  that is it. his conversation with what i think is supposed to be john lennon did not make sense either. does that mean the other  exist did they never meet to make music just all added up to a great idea that worked early in the film but did not follow through properly. all my opinion of course just left the tribeca film festival where the film premiered and i have to say the film was superb. everyone in the film is outstanding and danny boyle does a brilliant job handling some of the greatest songs ever written. speaking of that the beatles legacy will forever live on with this film. yesterdayso much of this movie was charming brilliantly acted and inventive however somewhere around the middle of the movie the missing the train scene it just turned into a big farce. the plot just became unbelievable it also turned corny and oversentimental. of course i accept the whole movie was built on supernatural premise but what follows must hang together and keep the audience rooting for our hero.what was  i loved the music i think this made the movie. jack malik played by himesh patel did a fine job he has mastered irony and deadpan we were all wanted this antihero to have his dream.what was  the plot was either so corny or so contrived some plot twists were just unnecessary and added nothing. elle played by lily james lost our sympathy she was presented as needy and pathetic and just as the culmination of him achieving their dream she tries to make him choose between his dream and her. the conclusion was unsatisfactory he wanted to be a musician and was fabulous at it he ended up a teacher big mistake.overall the was an overly contrived feel good movie i enjoyed whilst i was watching it but feel cheated and unsatisfied at the end. saw it at my cinema in lovran croatia just a few hours ago so it has  it is still pretty fresh while I am writing this.the whole idea is great have not seen those yet in mainstream cinema. the plot is pretty much straightforward with likeable characters great music of course and when the movie was over it left me with good feeling and a smile on my face still singing hey jude.all actors are really good but lily james is so adorable in this movie she shines in her character and steals every scene she is in. liked her the most obviously.take your girlfriendboyfriendfriendsfamily to see this romcom fantasy music comedy in cinema on a big screen and even if you will not like the movie you will sing beatles songs after and feel good about it guaranteed what a great premise totally wasted by a mediocre screenplay.acting is good but everything else falls flat. sheeran's participation does not really make any sense. he should have been just a cameo...all in all a big disappointment. there were three main reasons really in seeing 'yesterday'. the alternative world scenario sounded truly fascinating one of the most fascinating concepts in recent years to me and a refreshing change from the remakes and sequels constantly made today. like to love a lot of danny boyle's previous films and find him a talented director. the beatles are not all time favourites but do appreciate him highly understand their influence in music and like a lot of their songs a lot.while it could have done more with its concept 'yesterday' turned out to still be entertaining and charming that put me and my sister in an uplifting mood leaving the cinema. had not had an easy day or week even up to seeing the film so 'yesterday' was a much needed and appreciated antidote. as far as films released in  go it is neither one of the best or worst in a hit and miss year and somewhere around solid middle if having to rank.'yesterday' is a slick looking film not exemplary but never cheap. lily james looks great and the camera clearly loves her. the music of course is fantastic it is the beatles after all with some of their greatest hits exuberantly performed making one want to sing along regardless of whether they know all the words or not. hey jude is one of the most memorable examples. the script balances amusing comedy and never oversentimental drama without making it too cartoonish or mawkish well mostly.storywise 'yesterday' captures the feelgood spirit affectionately and the portrayal of the music industry was fun and did not get over the top. the john lennon bit is a highlight. boyle has done better and more inspired direction but still directs at a crisp pace and balances things quite well. the performances are good a truly charming james coming off best. himesh patel has come on a long way since 'eastenders' while kate mckinnon is riotous in the manager role.on the other viewpoint the concept was so fascinating and while it is always engaging the story is predictable and a bit too ordinary. especially the final third which is pretty much exactly as one would expect.ed sheeran's extended cameo for my tastes was rather puzzling and did not seem to gel with everything else.all that aside it was an enjoyable film on the whole and worth seeing.  yesterday is pure cinematic fluff with a lightningbolt of an idea. in moments those substanceless joys earn their cuteness. but as with writer richard curtis's other films about time there has  there is a unique ethical question underscoring the surface what rights does an artist have over a creation they did not create should we be honest about reality when that reality is not reality confused do not worry that complexity is all but completely brushed under the rug here opting instead for cheap explanations and corny romance.because of unimportant and uninteresting reasons an aspiring musician patel discovers he is the only person in the world who remembers the beatles. patel is great in the lead with impeccable timing and effortless charm he manages to steal all these classic songs without losing our sympathy. he has  he is supported by a handful of genuinely funny and sweet moments jokes at the expense of oasis and ed sheeran the reveals of other erased cultural touchstones cocacola harry potter etc even a surprisingly moving reveal of others who remember the past. unfortunately the story does not do much to help. lazy storytelling shortcuts are taken at every turn making a fantastical concept even more difficult to believe.curtis is usually quite adept with this type of romdramedy but he has  he is not at the helm here. boyle is and he has  he is known for his hyperstylized direction which proves problematic. where he spends time working on montages of ridiculous metaphorical storytelling devices he should be fleshing out character motivations and ethical conundrums. yesterday makes me glad we live in a reality with the beatles so we can ignore this movie and stay home to listen to abbey road. hey there is a moment in every one's life when you need a break and you need to remember that life can be simple can be romantic can be wistful can be about remembering what matters and why.this movie is not about fixing the world or fixing the audience it is about bringing a smile to your face while providing a special pleasure that we did not know we were missing out on the one that allow us to revel in the sound poetry and consciousness of one of the most iconic band the music scene has known.i enjoyed the movie with my kid who used to sing the beatles when she was a toddler and that turned into a teenager not particularly interested in the music her parent enjoyed who had as much a blast as i did during the movie.the acting rand true the emotion were genuine and the music was a blast there is absolutely no reason to miss out on this cool concept and movie. to cut a long story short with a film directed by danny boyle and based on a legendary band such as the beatles i was expecting significantly better although the movie is definitely not bad. the love story between jack malik and ellie appleton is excellently interpreted by himesh patel and the gorgeous lily james while kate mckinnon vervely interprets a sickening impresario. but the movie is globally disappointing with a certain flatness and a script suffering from a blatant lack of originality the « twilight zone » effect has been seen again and again so many times. in fact by being slightly in bad faith the film yesterday  can almost be reduced to the beatles songs. i am fully aware of the exaggeration but allow me to moan and groan I am slightly disappointed with such a banal rom com about the beatles a stuff of legend across all periods of time. i liked it. it was a refreshing change from the blockbuster superhero genre that is choking society.jack's struggle with the dishonesty was obvious throughout the film. the music was superb. ed sheeran's portrayal of himself was super cute.i was a little worried the writer would take it over the top and ed would decide jack was better than he and decide to stop making music. i am very glad they did not go there with the story.jack coming clean near the end and the way he did it was a good ending for me.also the fact that the beatles were not the only thingperson to disappear during the blackout was a fun touch.all in all it was an emotional fun twist of a movie. this film is an absolutely beautiful story that depicts the beatles' success in such a unique and brilliant way.himesh patel jack malik has an incredible voice and is absolutely perfect for his role. lily james ellie appleton is also the perfect person for her role as she depicts a very sweet school teacher who has been desperate for jack to love him since they met. this is also why the romantic element in this film is flawless and heartwarming particularly towards the end of the film.the film is also very funny and all the cast do an excellent job of making the audience laugh. ed sheeran playing himself is hilarious and i am very glad that he agreed to be a part of this film.do you enjoy the beatles and their songs comedy romance fantasy if you enjoy any of these things i guarantee you will love this film and i recommend you see it as soon as possible what a sweet wonderful film. even if you did not grow up with the beatles music like i did you should have a great appreciation for this film. whoever came up with the idea is a genius. the acting is wonderful the direction seems to be having as much fun as the actors are the music is well mostly the beatles but with new and fun arrangements that pay so much honor to the originals. and with the sweet little twists this movie does have a simple but touching moral. plus you have got kate mckinnon who can read a phone book and be amazing you kids under  will not know what a phone book is.if you need two hours to forget about all the bad things in this world or in your life and to just feel happy go see this movie after bohemian rhapsody and rocketman. yesterday is the next movie based on the classic song sang by a classic musicians. but unlike bohemian rhapsody and rocketman which are biography movies. yesterday is a fantasy comedy movie which is a different take from the previous two. did the movie deliver or did the movie disappoint. after seeing the first trailer back in february i was very interested in the its unique concept of the movie.the plot for the movie centers around jack malek who is a struggling musician until he had a bus crash while power was turned off about  seconds he then finds out that he is the only person who knows the songs of the beatles.the movie delivered on its premised in a lot of levels. the performances by himesh patel and lily james was excellent they had great chemistry and you can feel their friendship grew throughout the movie. i thought ed sheeran was not that bad in the movie and he was a lot better than i expecting considering that most real life musicians acting was mostly bad. the movie featured lots of classic beatles which was great even though let it be was on briefly i was expecting a full version of the record in the movie. but that did not ruin the whole movie. the ending of movie was very moving and emotional do not going to say anything about the ending but it was lovely ending.overall the movie was excellent it was original but unlike a lot of original movies that has a great premise but did not deliver this movie does deliver with great performances and a wonderful ending this movie is to enjoy by everyone who loves the the beatles or just want to have a great fun time at the cinema. i highly recommend it. I am no film buff. this ticked all my boxes. great music and every emotion covered. it has  it is not deep but in its own way it digs deeper than most. love love love it of course the film is packaged within the most basic cliched even romcom format. childhood sweethearts never expressed love for each other then something happens their relationship gets strained until love wins and is declared publicly.this is not a whodunnit you can guess the ending from the trailer. you will have seen countless films like this and you come to expect everything that happens to happen. just as you expect a chorus after a verse in a beatles song. or any other pop song.but within that outer layer there is a very interesting subject that the film explores what if we lost something that brings us all together what if we did not have a shared cultural experience to which we all give the same meaningwhen the blackout happens the beatles are not the only thing that disappears from public memory jack googles coke and the search engine  which is what gives meaning these days  displays a picture of pablo escobar. so when jack asks a waitress for coke it is not a ubiquitous beverage that the woman thinks of.and so jack finds himself with the opportunity to gain fame and riches by appropriating what had been a pillar of our postwar popular culture globally the beatles catalogue. because the true premise of the film is this everyone likes the beatles. and beatles songs therefore can be used by us all to communicate with each other.soon though jack finds that the music has lost its universal meaning for the people who now appreciate his music. he is confronted with the ruthless pragmatism of the music industry all the while being isolated by his alien cultural baggage and climb to fame.so when he reunites with the only two other people unaffected by the blackout he finds that meaning again and the plot finally twists.this is not a film about the beatles' music it is not a documentary about their legacy  it has  it is a film about a world suddenly losing shared experience about losing a consensus that brought us together.that has  that is why i thought the ending the other part of the ending the one I am not going to spoil was so uplifting and progressive. go watch it. i liked it i was twelve when the beatles became famous so i grew up with them. more than once a tear threatened to roll down my cheek but I am a simple lass so what the hell I am no bigarsed critic who is paid to be clever and differant. i thought the writing and the acting was spot on. as someone whose had a bit of success i appreciated that a great deal. very authentic i thought. but here's the thing about that cameo... i will not say who it is but when it happened my jaw hit the floor. amazing well done. and so so sad.great film. I shall  I will definitely buy the dvd.as an aside if we are supposed to write twenty lines at least in these reviews how come some of these reviews only contain two lines danny boyle is a director that i usually like but unfortunately this film disappointed me. i thought it was very cliched and filled to the brim with tropes and bad cringeworthy dialogue. i thought the acting was good and the premise was interesting but they do not live up to the potential of that premise. because rather than exploring the interesting questions that this premise entails like how the world the music industry and our understanding of music would change if the beatles were never a thing they instead just use this as a strange needlessly complex way of telling a by the books romance. overall i would not exactly recommend this film and i was pretty disappointed. sat with a big smile on my face the entire time. a world without the beatles is a world that is infinitely worse yesterday tells the story of jack an amateur musician who is trying to break into the industry with the help of his best friend ellie but when he gets hit by a truck riding his bike home one night he wakes up in an alternate universe where several things have turned out to have never existed but most importantly the beatles and their songs. jack decides to take advantage of this and uses the beatles' music to launch his career becoming the most famous pop star in the world.that premise sounds great and i was looking forward to a surreal comedy but to be honest it does not quite live up to it instead getting distracted by what the actual main plot turned out to be a cliche romantic comedy with the childhood friend that is secretly in love with the protagonist only for him to figure it out for himself later.the best moments of this film are to do with the central premise of the alternate universe where jack would reference something only for the people around him to say what has  what is that i mean it has  it is the same joke in different words basically every time but hey the way they execute it is pretty good. there are also some decent satirical moments with jack interacting with the music industry personified by jack's manager and an extended cameo by ed sheeran who falls victim to some selfdeprecating jokes but overall seems to be the secondary 'star' of the show besides the beatles' music.speaking of the beatles you had  you would be surprised by how little they actually contribute to the plot. for a film that is named after one of their more famous songs you had  you would think that their music and impact to society would be more than just a plot device for the main character to achieve his success. there has  there is no real commentary as to why the beatles music is so great you are just told over and over again that they are the greatest band ever and that a world without them ever existing would suck. sure that is something i would agree with but the film does not really add much of their own perspective to that side of the story it just takes that idea as fact.the romance is decent but cliche and overall unremarkable. screenwriter richard curtist definitely knows how to write romances having written several well regarded romcoms like love actually and about time but i would say that yesterday is not quite up to that standard. same goes for danny boyle and the other films he directed compared to this. the direction is not bad but it has  it is bland and does not really add much to the story. there are some weird shots like some weird dutch angles near the beginning of the story that seem out of place but nothing else unusual or amazing about the camerawork either.i guess if you like romcoms and beatles music this movie will definitely be watchable but for me as a person who does not actively seek out that genre this film did not stand out to me in either direction and overall I am disappointed that they did not take full advantage of the great premise. yesterday is so fun to watch i loved every moment of it. so good to finally see a film that is not a remake or a sequel. himesh patel and lily james were brilliant and relatable. i loved their chemistry.loved all the music obviously how can you not. the beatles are the biggest selling band in the world if they did not exist the world deservers to hear their music.however above all loved the underlying message success does not also have to be about the money you make and tell the truth at every possible opportunity you get.i cannot wait for this film to be released on dvd so i can watch it again and again. if you go into this expecting a  million action blockbuster you will be dissapointed. what this film delivers is a solid crime drama with some gritty and tense action scenes.a strong lead performance by joel kinnaman holds the story together and the film moves swiftly at a pace that never drags.if you want a film that gives you actual story over mindless hollywood cgi action then give this one a chance. if i had read the critics i would have ignored this film.i read a good review in the sunday express and went to see the film and liked it a lot.i will give no plot spoilers but if you like tough but not dumb crime films you will like this one.it does not have the biggest budget or the biggest action sequences but it is a good film.the plot is fine but the film also benefits from good locations and a talented cast.see this if you get the chance i think you will be glad you did. I have never heard of this film nor seen any trailers so i was not expecting much and decided to give it a go since there was not anything i have not already seen to watch. well wowI am shocked at some of the negative reviews so far. it goes to show you that you cannot please everyone. it has  it is either too hollywoodish or not hollywood enough lol.here's why i really liked it for starters this is actor andrea di stefano second ever attempt at directing and writing and compared to some of the films that have come out lately  and from seasoned writer and directors he nailed it. was it flawless no. but considering is was not a big budget hollywood production with seasoned filmmakers and with all lead cast being alisters but instead a britishmade bgrade film with newb filmmakers this was produced exceptionally well and is a winner imo.i found the story very realistic and unhollywoodish which is refreshing for a change. sure this story has been done many times before but this one felt authentic. the last time i saw this type of genre movie that surprised and impressed me was shot caller.casting was perfect with all leads playing their respective roles on point especially joel kinnaman who nailed his character.cinematography was great the scoresound was fitting and the productionlocation sets authentic. my only critique would be the pacing needed picking up in some parts andor the  min runtime trimmed down at least  mins.aside from that this was one of the best bgrade films I have seen with its unpredictable plot turn at every corner excellent central performances all packaged really well by an newbie filmmaker. it has  it is a solid  from meto see any of my  ratings and  reviews click on my username. great actingwife could have been better many intense moments and simple believable script. all of us have seen at least one similar movie in our lifes so dont expect anything new as i do think this movie is just meant to make your heart pump faster. if you have seen the trailer this film does what it says on the tin. it is a decent copbad guy film that is a little different in its storyline.the film rattles along a decent pace and has some good scenes. there is some quite good suspense and action along the way as well.where the film is let down is the ending is just so clear aside from a tiny twist from about half way through the film and even then when it happens it has  it is quite a damp squib. there are also parts of the story that just do not stack up which is a shame as it has good potential. what a nice change to get away from the 'typical' holywood action flick and to get into a grittier morally ambiguous uncompromising drama. rosamund pike continues to prove what a great actor she is with a performance that echoes her character in beirut. joel kinnaman gives a performance that is just as conflicted and compelling as altered carbon. altogether a great cast that manages to build realistic characters. my only criticism of the script is the overly detailed explanation of fentanyl that pike gives to her team on fbi agents  it has  it is the only point where you feel the film patronises the audience. other than that a thoroughly enjoyable movie. the informer is an enjoyable and well made thriller despite the generic plot and some predictable moments. joel kinnaman gives a great lead performance with good supporting performances from common rosamund pike clive owen and ana de armas. it has  it is also well paced with an intense fight scene and tense gunfight in the third act. if you like action films with good story plus good acting this is the one for you. personally i really enjoyed this movie and i would go again to it. an absorbing thrill ride of a crime thriller. unlike some reviewers i actually found this well paced with enough twists to keep it interesting and a ruthless violent edge alongside the drama. was tempted to even rate as a  until near the end but i just cannot stand open endings to these things no matter how minor unless we know there'll be a sequel i just want to know how the story is resolved fully. nevertheless one of the better thrillers of the year so far and well worth a watch. this is not normally my kind of movie but i quite enjoyed it. the characters all felt pretty realistic the actors all did a decent job and the story was compelling.it did feel a bit slow at points and i think maybe a little careful trimming could have done the film some good but even so it keeps you engaged and doesnt leave itself too open to easy prediction as you watch.worth a watch i would say. started out kinda strong but quickly fizzled out.i was surprised to see such good actors in this mediocre film except for common he cannot act himself out of a paper bag.in the end it was a disappointment. great absorbing thriller with good guys bad guys and guys somewhere in the middle. sicario  was the last one that i enjoyed as much as this. it was like reading an elmore leonard story but without the humour. i understand that the uk did a good job of standing in for new york. what a surprise because it did feel like the big apple. i liked the flow of the film. you did not always follow what was going on  I am still not sure of the role played by the drugs in the tulips  but the scenes did not linger. the film was a little openended. if the make the informer  i would buy a ticket for it. the informerdirector andrea de stefanostarring joel kinnamonrosamund pikeana de armascommonclive own etcoverall rating  ex convict pete coslow gets involved with a shooting of a nypd cop. he has to go back to prison in order to stop a drug gang from getting away with there crimes. but the lifes of his wife and child is at risk and its up to officer wilcox  rosamund pike to help him be reunited with his family. the informer was a good thriller but a flawed film but still thoroughly entertaining lets get into why this is.first of all the film did a fantastic job of delivering an incredibly tense tone. the film did a fantastic job with keeping you on the edge of your seat. in fact i think this is up there with the most tense and unsettling films of the year in my opinion. the film just put the audience through so many uncomfortable situations. and with the lack of soundtrack it really helped with the authenticity of the film. whether it was being attacked in the prison or in my opinion the most uncomfortable scene when the main characters wife and child was being gagged and threatened. also the violence and gore helped with the entertainment value of the film. but also added to the tense tone and impact of each scene with a heads up some very gory things that were borderline  rating in my opinion.however my first issue is the slow pacing in the first half of the film. in my opinion the first half of the film was very slow and made me lose interest a few times. there was just a lot of filler conversations and standing around that left me needing something to spice the film up and make it more entertaining. but luckily they more then redeemed themselves in the second half of the film where it had a absolutely fantastic final act. they really went all out in the last half of the film to make you care about all of the characters and to keep you on the edge of your seat. with all the action was non stop within the last  minutes of the film so this more then made up for the first half of the film.next i think the informer had a good amount of emotional weight to it. the fact that joel kinnamons character. just wanted to get to his family and the love he showed them really made his character more respected in my opinion. and you related to him a bit more because most people are close to there families so being away from them is hard so everyone couldpassively relate to his emotional state with his wife and kid.next i think they really portrayed the harsh reality of prison life really well. a lot of films with prisons in can be very tame with what they show maybe due to the age rating but this film. showed the types of people the horrible conditions that prisoners rightly have to go through so this was just a nice touch to see. however i do have to say that the film was very stereotypical with what type if inhabitants take up prisons. i think having a lot of the prisoners black and to have it split by colour is fairly old fashioned and they should of picked a more diverse group of people.now my final two positives would be the fantastic acting was joel kinnamon and rosamund pike. rosamund pike was fantastic in the cop role. she was clever and did not take no for a answer whilst also having a kind heart and a nag for doing the right thing. and joel kinnamon showed great diversity in the film. his character had a great blend of intimidationvulnerability and perseverance and despite maybe not agreeing with some of his actions largely he was a character that you could support.however i do have to end on my final two negatives. first of all there was next to no character development or depth to most of the characters. most of the characters were very one dimensional. and petes wife did next to nothing in the film apart from being petes motivation she was just a damsel in distress which was a shame considering the films of today with strong female characters. and finally there was some incredibly dislikable characters. some of joels workmates who killed policemen and threatened his wife and kid were just sick and really made you not like there characters. i know this was the goal but for whatever reason something was off about some of the characters that really made you question the reasoning for them being there in the script.overall the informer is a thoroughly entertaining and tense thriller with excellent acting. but is narratively flawed and could used with more developed and likeable characters. joel kinnaman is about the only thing holding this together. he has  he is an excellent actor and if you like him this is worth watching. the movie is at times suspenseful but hollywood seems to have given up on creating anything even slightly realistic. this movie is absurd and as it goes on only gets more absurd. towards the end i was actually laughing which is not a good sign when the movie is suppose to be a dramatic thriller. worth a watch for joel or if you have nothing else to watch. an unremarkable action thriller which is not particularly good or bad just mediocre. it has  it is a bit boring at times a bit too cliché at times and a bit implausible at times but the story is gritty the action scenes are well put together and the acting and characters are good if a bit  dimensional. from the team that brought you sicario comes another drug fuelled thriller with an amazing cast although set in the usa was filmed on location in the uk and is a uk production .rosamund pike plays 'emily blunt' who was missing from sicario  hence why that was so poor in comparison to the first .this one is based on the polish mafia operating in nyc .good tension  good story  great acting  stand out performance for me was the rapper common as the nypd detective with the street cred and look to make him a star in his own right .central to the theme was family and the love of man for his wife and daughter and vice versa caught up in a web of crime he never deserved to be in .it has  it is one those films where the natural good guys and bad guys were twisted to make it more interestingan enjoyable film with a little bit of violence but appropriate to the plot .worth seeing .pad.a  the premise of the film is decent but the execution is woeful. the story revolves around a military veteran involved in a drug ring being investigated by the fbi and the nypd.unfortunately virtually no time is spent on character introduction  development which makes it hard to care about any of the main protagonists. it has  it is just a series of improbable scenes which bear virtually no relation to each other. it does not help that the audio mixing is terrible rendering much of the dialogue unintelligible.joel kinnaman does his best to portray a believable character but clive owen is his usual wooden self. the other characters are completely forgettable.this could have been a decent film but the production and editing are dreadful and completely fail to tell a compelling or even coherent story.  and that has  that is being generous. this movie is a prime example of a terrible script screwing up a film.the acting is good and the directing okay but the story is so bad that you stop believing in the horrible plot and they add a terrible finale that suspends any chance of belief that you just laugh and smirk that anyone thought this was a good idea of a story line. plus the ending is so preposterous it feels like it is a tv series with a part  to be continued.as if this piece of crap would have a sequel....a  for the acting i really enjoyed it it is one of the best movies i have seen for a long time. i did not watch the trailer and probably this was helpful. sometimes trailers tells you everything in advance and according to a few comments this is whats happening here aswell. so do not watch the trailer just go and enjoy this exciting movie with excellent actors. the informeri really had high hopes for this movie and some things were good but overall so many aspects were just unsatisfactory and not thought through.what was . the acting was first rate except perhaps for joel kinnaman who had the look but mumbled his way through a very stiff performance. not a good start as in many ways the film rested on him. the cinematography was good and helped the tension and narrative flow.what was  too little variety in the movie all we had was threat menace and  the plot was labyrinthine keep it simple. some of the turns were ridiculous the nypd cop arrived on his own to sort out a shoot out. the fbi had authority to act and then tried to conceal their actions. criminal gangs rarely accept new members so the police try to turn existing members. the hostage scene was absurd as any idiot can spot a prisoner from a guard. the informer's wife sophia had the acting skills of a dead ant the ab school of acting. the clash of theatre and method acting was so marked i laughed aloud.this was a boys movie with questionable acting and an absurd script such a shame when you consider the calibre of actors involved. first found joel kinnaman in the killing and have always really liked his acting. he is a very strong actor and really enjoyed his role in this movie. it has some strong action sequences with the right amount of drama. would recommend this film for sure great complex storyline but easy to follow. very good film with superb acting. confused why the rating is not higher yet. pete joel kinnaman  is working an an informer for the fbi. their goal is to take down the general and his drug operation. the plan had to be aborted when a cop was killed. the general wants pete to go to prison and run a drug operation. the fbi thinks it is a good idea for him to go to prison and get the details. things do not go well while he is in prison either.this is a metoo crime film. pike is better as a gone girl than an fbi agent. the whole film had a metoo aspect to it.guide fword. no sex or nudity. my heart pumping all the time ..i need to see the next what will happen  enjoyable entertaining thriller. worth a watch. good acting.\""

       " ' and you related to him a bit more because most people are close to there families so being away from them is hard so everyone couldpassively relate to his emotional state with his wife and kid',\n",
       " 'next i think they really portrayed the harsh reality of prison life really well',\n",
       " ' a lot of films with prisons in can be very tame with what they show maybe due to the age rating but this film',\n",
       " ' showed the types of people the horrible conditions that prisoners rightly have to go through so this was just a nice touch to see',\n",
       " ' however i do have to say that the film was very stereotypical with what type if inhabitants take up prisons',\n",
       " ' i think having a lot of the prisoners black and to have it split by colour is fairly old fashioned and they should of picked a more diverse group of people',\n",
       " 'now my final two positives would be the fantastic acting was joel kinnamon and rosamund pike',\n",
       " ' rosamund pike was fantastic in the cop role',\n",
       " ' she was clever and did not take no for a answer whilst also having a kind heart and a nag for doing the right thing',\n",
       " ' and joel kinnamon showed great diversity in the film',\n",
       " ' his character had a great blend of intimidationvulnerability and perseverance and despite maybe not agreeing with some of his actions largely he was a character that you could support',\n",
       " 'however i do have to end on my final two negatives',\n",
       " ' first of all there was next to no character development or depth to most of the characters',\n",
       " ' most of the characters were very one dimensional',\n",
       " ' and petes wife did next to nothing in the film apart from being petes motivation she was just a damsel in distress which was a shame considering the films of today with strong female characters',\n",
       " ' and finally there was some incredibly dislikable characters',\n",
       " ' some of joels workmates who killed policemen and threatened his wife and kid were just sick and really made you not like there characters',\n",
       " ' i know this was the goal but for whatever reason something was off about some of the characters that really made you question the reasoning for them being there in the script',\n",
       " 'overall the informer is a thoroughly entertaining and tense thriller with excellent acting',\n",
       " ' but is narratively flawed and could used with more developed and likeable characters',\n",
       " ' joel kinnaman is about the only thing holding this together',\n",
       " ' he has  he is an excellent actor and if you like him this is worth watching',\n",
       " ' the movie is at times suspenseful but hollywood seems to have given up on creating anything even slightly realistic',\n",
       " ' this movie is absurd and as it goes on only gets more absurd',\n",
       " ' towards the end i was actually laughing which is not a good sign when the movie is suppose to be a dramatic thriller',\n",
       " ' worth a watch for joel or if you have nothing else to watch',\n",
       " ' an unremarkable action thriller which is not particularly good or bad just mediocre',\n",
       " ' it has  it is a bit boring at times a bit too cliché at times and a bit implausible at times but the story is gritty the action scenes are well put together and the acting and characters are good if a bit  dimensional',\n",
       " ' from the team that brought you sicario comes another drug fuelled thriller with an amazing cast although set in the usa was filmed on location in the uk and is a uk production ',\n",
       " \"rosamund pike plays 'emily blunt' who was missing from sicario  hence why that was so poor in comparison to the first \",\n",
       " 'this one is based on the polish mafia operating in nyc ',\n",
       " 'good tension  good story  great acting  stand out performance for me was the rapper common as the nypd detective with the street cred and look to make him a star in his own right ',\n",
       " 'central to the theme was family and the love of man for his wife and daughter and vice versa caught up in a web of crime he never deserved to be in ',\n",
       " 'it has  it is one those films where the natural good guys and bad guys were twisted to make it more interestingan enjoyable film with a little bit of violence but appropriate to the plot ',\n",
       " 'worth seeing ',\n",
       " 'pad',\n",
       " 'a  the premise of the film is decent but the execution is woeful',\n",
       " ' the story revolves around a military veteran involved in a drug ring being investigated by the fbi and the nypd',\n",
       " 'unfortunately virtually no time is spent on character introduction  development which makes it hard to care about any of the main protagonists',\n",
       " ' it has  it is just a series of improbable scenes which bear virtually no relation to each other',\n",
       " ' it does not help that the audio mixing is terrible rendering much of the dialogue unintelligible',\n",
       " 'joel kinnaman does his best to portray a believable character but clive owen is his usual wooden self',\n",
       " ' the other characters are completely forgettable',\n",
       " 'this could have been a decent film but the production and editing are dreadful and completely fail to tell a compelling or even coherent story',\n",
       " '  and that has  that is being generous',\n",
       " ' this movie is a prime example of a terrible script screwing up a film',\n",
       " 'the acting is good and the directing okay but the story is so bad that you stop believing in the horrible plot and they add a terrible finale that suspends any chance of belief that you just laugh and smirk that anyone thought this was a good idea of a story line',\n",
       " ' plus the ending is so preposterous it feels like it is a tv series with a part  to be continued',\n",
       " 'as if this piece of crap would have a sequel',\n",

       " ' the acting was first rate except perhaps for joel kinnaman who had the look but mumbled his way through a very stiff performance',\n",

       " ' the cinematography was good and helped the tension and narrative flow',\n",
       " 'what was  too little variety in the movie all we had was threat menace and  the plot was labyrinthine keep it simple',\n",
