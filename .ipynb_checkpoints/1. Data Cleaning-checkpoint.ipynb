       "[['What an excellent film by Rian Johnson; definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time!',\n",
       "  'Nothing was typical about this. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow, the scenario, everything.\\nI highly recommend it for mystery lovers, for anyone who wants to watch a good movie!',\n",
       "  'This is a movie one would not regret spending money on. After a long time I am rating a movie perfect 10 and this movie totally deserves it. I really like the subtle comedy sprinkled in the movie. It easies out the tense atmosphere. In a good detective movie, you expect to be taken aback on how things unfold at the end and this is what happens in this movie. There is never an instant when you would get distracted or bored. I had a good time watching this movie and you would surely have it too.',\n",
       "  'With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with \"Knives Out\", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It\\'s abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie\\'s typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of \"Knives Out\" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan\\'s bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. \"Knives Out\" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn\\'t deserve all this hatred from disappointed \"Star Wars\" geeks)',\n",
       "  \"As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre.\",\n",
       "  \"Best movie of the year, love everything about it, what I'm seeing is that some trolls that still can't get over TLJ, now for those that have and give it a 1 well that's fair but have some reasons why, not just bc it's Rian Johnson, like stop it's childish\",\n",
       "  \"I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn't live up to it for me. But I thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I'm not sorry I spent some money on this one.\",\n",
       "  \"Let me start by saying that the film is good. It's a solid murder mystery and I'll make sure I watch Knives Out 2 when it comes out. All I kept hearing about this film was that it was hilarious and brilliant and 'so damn good' etc etc etc. I usually take these sorts of reactions with a grain of salt but, having seen the trailer and seeing how great the cast was, I bought into the hype. It looked so stylish, so compelling.\\nI really got my hopes up, and I can't help thinking I would have enjoyed the film far more if I hadn't been inundated with so many reviews heralding it as some brilliant masterpiece.\\nI was expecting a lot of laughs and whilst I did laugh on occasion, I didn't laugh nearly as much as I was hoping I would. A film like this would have benefited from some black humor (maybe Rian could have co-written the film wish a British comedy writer for some more quality laughs... Phoebe Waller Bridge, perhaps?)\\nI enjoyed the scenes when the whole family was together and interacting with each other and I wish the film spent more time on them instead of opting for that ridiculous car chase and several other scenes that took me out of the whodunnit atmosphere.\\nOverall, this film is a solid good time, entertaining, clever and well acted and written but, in my opinion, definitely doesn't live up to the hype.\",\n",
       "  'I have read the many glowing reviews for this film and I honestly don\\'t get it. Yes, there were some very funny and entertaining parts. It was a very good ensemble cast. Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the \"murder\" was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying \"Random, you\\'re back AGAIN\" or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the \"slayer\" law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn\\'t there be at least some surprises?Nor do I believe this is a \"commentary\" on our situation today. Yes, there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.That is not to say it is a bad film. Daniel Craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball. Lots of kooky things happened. But I think this is better for a late-nite Netflix watch.I certainly don\\'t see it as being \"best of the year.\"',\n",
       "  \"I went into this film with high expectations to say the least. I had heard so many good things about it, so it was built up in my mind as this phenomenal murder mystery movie, but it fell short. Where do I begin? Daniel Craig has this southern accent that just does not come across as convincing, not annoying, but not convincing. The main character of the film, Marta, potrayed by Ana de Armas, has this very unbelievable physiological condition in which she vomits every time that she tells a lie. I mean, come on people. This vomiting 'tool' is used multiple times throughout the film to figure out the truth about some of the other characters in the story. Let's just say that she vomits excessively until the credits start to roll.Now, the part of this film that really upset me was the 'big reveal' at the end. It is revealed at the end that detective Benoit Blanc knew about the blood stain on Marta's shoe the whole time. The biggest issue with this reveal is why he didn't ask her about it. He would have known her involvment in the murder the whole time. Why didn't he get the blood spot on her shoe tested? That would have easily put her in the room with Harlan when he died.Overall, the movie was entertaining up until we are revealed what happened between Marta and Harlan. Once I found out how Harlan died, I started to lose interest. It basically lost the 'mystery' quality once that happened. The story went flat after that but then took off when new developments started to happen. The reason I give this movie a 6/10 is because I was able to figure out things about the story right away, which left me disappointed, and the blood spot made me question a majority of the movie. It wasn't a bad watch, but I don't think I will be watching it again.\",\n",
       "  \"Being a middle aged Englishman I've been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I've been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of 'Knives Out' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you'd not be any less aware of what's happening. A bit of a shame really.\",\n",
       "  \"I'm a mystery lover and have seen and read every Agatha Christie tale. I found this movie very slow for the first half. Second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit, nor the charm and period atmosphere of a Poirot episode (which I can watch over and over - thank you David Suchet and the other main actors). The lead actress was very attractive, but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch, as well as ridiculously unbelievable (I guess that was the funny part?). Some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather-beaten. Did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. The last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid-fire conclusion thank the Lord. Agree that Daniel Craig with that southern accent was just super annoying. Great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat. Over and over. It moved pretty slowly for me at times. I guess I'm in a minority on this one. I'm not saying it was terrible but it was not a great movie for me.\",\n",
       "  \"Mildly entertaining with a great cast and high production value. The story is soft but not awful. I can't imagine saying this film deserves more than a 6.\",\n",
       "  'Knives out uses a really old idea, the \"whodunit\". Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don\\'t really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig\\'s amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don\\'t know much about Star Wars as I don\\'t really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don\\'t know what\\'s going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its\\' director. Looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious Oscar contender for multiple awards, while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls (?) etc. I\\'m confused.',\n",
       "  'I say it\\'s nothing special and I\\'m not a Star Wars fanatic. I\\'ve never even seen the film people are so angry about, so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film, Knives Out.I definitely expected more. If it\\'s meant to be amusing, it pretty much failed on that score. This film would be better suited as a TV movie, if they even make them anymore, or something to pop up on Netflix. I didn\\'t pay to see it and I\\'d feel I\\'d wasted my money if I had.Visually it was enjoyable-I mean the location, the house, the production values. the family members were an unattractive bunch, so nothing to look at there. Daniel Craig\\'s \"southern\" accent became grating after awhile, and I was squirming a bit with boredom, waiting for it to be over. And, when it was, my reaction was \"So what? Who cares?\" I can hardly remember any of it and I just watched it in the last couple of hours.Convoluted, unrealistic and tedious, like a lot of Agatha Christie stories. How this has ended up on some people\\'s Best Films of 2019 lists is beyond me. It was okay; nothing special.',\n",
       "  'Knives Out (2019)\\n8/10🗡🚪💉💸\"Rian Johnson successfully revives the \"whodunnit\" mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time, even if it doesn\\'t bring anything groundbreaking to the table.\"Knives Out is the kind of \"whodunnit\" film that will never fail to entertain. As a progressive mystery, Knives Out is a very fashionable movie with it\\'s grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. With some very snarky and slick writing, these characters are albeit memorable, most notably Daniel Craig\\'s Detective Blanc and Chris Evan\\'s Ransome, however, the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson\\'s strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it\\'s footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.Verdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways.',\n",
       "  'GENERAL REVIEW\\nGoing in, I was expecting an energetic Edgar Wright feel, and complex Sherlock Holmes mystery in which the audience tries to solve it at the same time. What I got was a cookie cutter \\'mystery\\' that was different from others in its genre only in its use of bright colours, rather than any sort of trope and convention subversion or parody.SPOILER TIMEIn regards to acting, Christopher Plummer, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans gave great performances. 0 complaints for the main 3, I thoroughly enjoyed Harlan and Marta\\'s scenes. There are more than 3 members of the cast, of which I have complaints; Jamie Lee Curtis and Micheal Shannon among others gave performances that seemed to change personalities every few lines, probably due to Rian Johnson\\'s directing. Don Johnson was good, LaKeith Stanfield was not, others were mediocre or just less.\\nSpecial Daniel Craig section. Daniel Daniel Daniel. What was that. The screenplay reads \"Blanc ... speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have ever heard in your life.\" That is not what I was forced to listen to. The accent was very distracting and I could only hope for a case of Stockholm syndrome that never came. His character was meant to act as an absurdist archetype satire of the noir detective, but instead he came across as an annoying detective who did not diverge from the archetypal role. If that didn\\'t bother you then it would have been a good performanceAs mentioned I was expecting more Edgar Wright-esque editing and cinematography that the trailer promised me.Overall, the writing is very basic, being a typical murder mystery. I am unsure if you can even call it a murder mystery when you find out the truth a quarter through. Throughout the story, there were many setups with minimal or no payoff, e.g. shoe blood, where is Marta from (Harlan should have commented to Ransom during their fight where she is from). There were also too many inconsistencies, like how the stairs did not actually make a noise every time, some people went up with a noise and down without because Rian Johnson forgot.\\nFor the final reveal; Marta must be especially talented to feel \"tincture and viscosity\" of vials, a quality you might be able to feel when you are drawing a syringe, but she had made the choice already which solution to use, maybe density or weight would be acceptable but the given explanation of her being such a good person that her vail choice was correct is pretty dumb. Also, the shots for Fran\\'s last words were different, where she said \"you did this\" in the scene and first flashback, but \"Hugh did this\" in the last. These 2 issues detract from the fun of watching murder mysteries, in which an audience should be able to find the killer if they have been paying attention, instead the script pretended like you should have known these facts.\\nThe suspect game instead was played by cast knowledge. By looking at the cast you can see it\\'s either Jamie Lee Curtis, Micheal Shannon or Chris Evans, personally I guessed Micheal Shannon due to his typecasting, but when I realised that all 3 of Harlan\\'s children where the same character, with different jobs, it was then obviously the built up character named Ransom. Ransom. His name is Ransom.This leads me to one of my main critiques: Unnecessary characters. Despite all 3 of Harlan\\'s children being the same, the \"nazi kid\" served 1 purpose that could have easily been delivered by another character, the granddaughter, Katherine Langford served a whopping 2 purposes that all together could have been dropped and exchanged. There were 2 cops and Blanc for some reason, of which the comedic policeman was not funny.Lastly, too many convenient devices like the stairs that made a noise \\'every time\\', Marta vomiting when she lies, the dogs choosing to like and dislike people, or the various murder mystery cliches that excuse themselves through being self aware (secret doors and prop knives)',\n",

Everyone knows that there are many bitter Star Wars fanboys rating this film low because they are still so bitter over Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi and as a result, they are going to try to ruin any of Rian's future films. They really need to just get over it and get a life, already. DON'T believe the Star-Rating of This Film Because It's Mostly from Bitter Star Wars Fanboys Rating the Film LOW ON PURPOSE!, obviously. Anyone who has actually seen this film would be brain-dead to rate it low or to not give it a good review because this film is so freaking entertaining! I could see it again and again.

And for the cast, what a freaking cast! I couldn't even tell you who the MVP of the cast was. They were all fantastic. We need more films like this and less big explosions, stupid plot films. I for one, will give this the true star-rating it deserves! 10/10!!!!!

       "  \"Have to say I was a little disappointed by this, not because it isn't good. Arguably it is, but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good, which it isn't. So as with so many films your experience & enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.Overall I think nearly everyone will enjoy this, particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated CGI. Having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of Hollywood. One of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath, but not always beneath, the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it's difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie, which without giving too much away it ultimately does.What is genuinely enjoyable is Daniel Craig's slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match. The rest of the cast features some big names, but unfortunately as others have pointed out they don't always have that much to do. Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is Don Johnson.The Plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all, and while it's quite good, it isn't that good or that original. The key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable (for the record I didn't work out who did it, but did work out the mechanism involved). If one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement Knives Out falls somewhat short. A part of the problem is that for much of the film it isn't clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place. In the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister.Perhaps the best aspect of the film, aside of Daniel Craig, was the fact that the Johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy & the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller. I'll probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I'd have to say I probably enjoyed Adam Sandler & Jennifer Aniston's Murder Mystery more than this, including with regard to the solution. Knives Out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it - or anyone else I'd venture - thinks it is. Still enjoyable though\",\n",

       "  'A Stella cast carrying a whodunit will depend entirely on the story... Sadly, instead of \"the plot thickens\", it thins out unbearably...Overall the movie was entertaining enough to watch... But the plot was stretched a little thin and the ending was disappointing...A whodunit works by bringing the audience along to try to figure out the crime and be pleasantly surprised at the big reveal... This movie decided at the half way point that it no longer wants to be a whodunit and we no longer should follow along as it does its own thing... Sigh...I wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone who truly enjoy the genre..Spoiler Alert...Let\\'s tackle the minor annoyances first...1) The beginning sets everyone out as having a motive to murder... Standard for the genre but here, it stops there...No building up of everyone/anyone who also had the opportunity to commit the murder... Motive without opportunity doesn\\'t add up to murder...This means... Before the middle of the story, we have already eliminated almost everyone as the suspect... Which kinda defeats the whodunit plotline...2) Having a girl who is a witness who vomits if she lies is extremely convenient for a murder detective... And... Surely any investigator will target her for as much information as possible...Here however, to preserve the big reveal later I guess, they let her off without ever really questioning her...(even Ransom got more information than the investigators did...)In fact, the detectives were more interested in talking to Benoit and kept telling her to go away after finding out this rather beneficial condition...This leaves a feeling of a weak plot that cannot exclude her from some crucial events...She didn\\'t have to witness the suicide... Which in itself didn\\'t add anything to the story... And with that, she could spill the beans on what she did and we can all still believe there was further foul play involved...3) Marta and Benoit find the hidden tox report after spending hours to chase it down... Yet they can sit down to have a chat after finding it but neither even opened it to take a look?This gives us the scene where she was about to confess in front of the whole family but was stopped in mid sentence... Drama!!!!That\\'s ridiculous and again feels forced/false...4) Walt confronts Marta at her home... He evades the horde of reporters and came in via the back way...Firstly, a rich guy like him would likely never have to use the back way and wouldn\\'t be able to find one...Secondly, Walt is the \\'boss\\' of a printing empire and it\\'s unreasonable that nobody in the media recognises him...Thirdly, he walks/limps with a cane...Is he really the best person to go seek Marta out under the circumstance?\\nWouldn\\'t Meg, Donna or Jacob be better suited for the stealth-required mission?5) Captain frigging America... Emm, I mean Ransom... When he left and came back, wouldn\\'t that be recorded in the early part of the surveillance video? He stopped exactly where she stopped...Ok, this one, maybe I can accept the reason is he knows the area well and was able to evade detection... Still unsatisfying though...6) Fran wants to confront Ransom believing he killed Harlan...a woman, confronting a man/killer even if he\\'s not Captain America, surely wouldn\\'t choose an abandoned/creepy location to meet..What does she think will happen? This is not a slasher flick where dumb teenagers go into the room despite multiple warnings not to...7) Harlan was in a terrible rush to kill himself...Marta explained that he will die in\\n10 minutes... And at around the 5 minutes mark, he will sweat profusely and have some other symptoms...Wouldn\\'t a normal person wait until the symptoms start to show before reaching for the knife?\\nMany more minor niggles like Benoit not needing to introduce himself before sitting inside the house witnessing all the \\'interrogations\\'... -There seem to be no other maids or servants in such a huge, well maintained house, that needed to be questioned... -Marta just happens to have a large magnet in her pocket for erasing a video tape... -Nobody who wasn\\'t around needs to have an alibi for their whereabouts...-none of the other detectives see the blood stain on Marta\\'s shoe...Too many roll eyes moments for a whodunit plot...Now...Let\\'s get to the parts that killed the movie/story...1) Benoit doing his best Poirot... And gave too much details without any evidence...Examples...-He could simply say Ransom switched the medication.. But instead, he goes into details of how he sucked out medication from one bottle and then from the other bottle... How would he know that?-How did he deduce that it was Ransom who sent him the cash?-How can he be so sure that a person with dementia simply didn\\'t mix up \\'back\\' and \\'back again\\'... Very thin even if we can accept the inference...If he\\'s wrong at any point, Ransom could stop him and the story telling ends...These plus some other details he brought up without any evidence shows that he is just showboating and not very professional... He should be more mindful of his reputation... And this goes against his persona of being careful with what he says as shown in the beginning...2) the claim is that Ransom torched the examiners\\' office the night before... And yet in the morning light (actually around 9am already...) and the fire on that not-large building seem to just get going... In real life, it should be ashes before daylight... Unless it was touched an hour or two before 9am...Since Ransom was with Marta in the morning, he couldn\\'t have done it...3) we were told that overdose of morphine means dying in 10 minutes...When Marta found Fran, Ransom was in police custody and there was nobody else around... She should be the prime suspect...And obviously, Ransom couldn\\'t have done that too...4) in the scene where she makes her escape after the will reading...the family couldn\\'t stop her if she wanted to drive away... Richard said something like, what do you want me to do, bite the bumper?(to stop her leaving...)... But when she came out of the car, push through the crowd to get into Ransom\\'s car, not a single person stopped her getting in...This is of course essential for her to spend quality time with Ransom... Totally unrealistic...In conclusion...As said... Not bad entertainment (6-7) but a terrible whodunit (2-3)... So around 4.5 overall...'],\n",

Now there are two sides to that coin. One is that the character is unique and interesting to watch from a medical point of view, and that's why the movie puts him there. But the other side of that coin is that it becomes really frustrating and hard to watch very quickly. It gives the film a point of difference, but a point of difference for the sake of it isn't always enough.Tye Sheridan does a fantastic job playing the lead role. He nails Aspergers syndrome. Before it was ever mentioned in the film I was 100% certain that was what I was looking at. He keeps it up for the entire movie and never drops a scene either. The other cast member who really impressed me was Ana de Armas. I came to learn of her acting talents in 'Knives Out' and she has impressed me again here. She didn't have anything overly special to do in the film, but you could still tell she was a class above the rest.The film itself is a little obvious in what it is trying to set up and surprise the audience with. There's one scene in particular that they thought they were being subtle with, but in reality it put all the cards on the table and gave the game away. Also there is a mystery element of sorts to the film that, had it been handled differently, could have been really interesting. Instead it was just clunky and petered out to dust by the end. I think the thing to watch this film for is Sheridan's performance and as a character study of an Aspergers syndrome. Otherwise there isn't a whole lot going for it.\",\n",

But if you expect something to pass your free time with a short linear mystery thriller, this is the movie for you.The plot is quite monotonous with the only twist was at the end but it is what i'm expecting by reading the synopsis. It's about an MC who have an asperger syndrom accused of murder. The focus is not whether he did it or not because i think it is pretty self explanatory during the scene. If you as many people expect this as the main focus of this movie, again, prepare to be disappointed. It is about how the MC want to prove that he's innocent without the help of police, how he trapped all who's involved or related to the murder that want to set him up but actually he know's all along and how he set them up again.All in all, it's not really that bad.\",\n",

Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.\\nThe Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be.

       "  \"For film fanatics like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is a great film for people to see, regardless if they've witnessed the original or not. On the other hand, if you've never seen the original Blade Runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I'd have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. It's very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that's exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why Blade Runner 2049 is a must see as soon as possible. Before dropping you into this world with Ryan Gosling's character, there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past, but even though that information is given to you, your experience just won't be the same without having viewed the first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it. Set out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story, Ryan Gosling's character (who will remain nameless for the sake of this review) uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past, inevitably involving Rick Deckard. Quite honestly, that's the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience, so let's get technical. If not for anything else, Blade Runner 2049 benefits from some of the best cinematography I've laid my eyes on in years. From the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects, to the mind- blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department, I have nothing but praise for this film. Whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience, the visuals alone should have you applauding, due to their incredibly detailed nature. I personally found the overall film to be magnificent, but when certain scenes were dialogue-free and asking you to gasp at the imagery, that's exactly what I was doing, as I feel many audiences members will. Again, without giving anything away, once Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) enters the picture, the way both films sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion. It does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past, as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process. With a terrifically restrained performance by Ryan Gosling, you'll find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall, as he uncovers these mysteries. With the addition of Harrison Ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances, as well as Ana de Armas in a role that really took me by surprise, this film was casted to the nines from beginning to end. Some may complain about Jared Leto and Dave Bautista not being included as much, but I felt as though the served the story quite nicely. In the end, this movie aims to impress Sci-Fi fans across the world, but I feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made, are those who've had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is 1982's Blade Runner. I don't say this about films very often, especially when talking about sequels, but I haven't been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time. This is definitely a superior film than the original, it's one of the best films of 2017, and I'll be revisiting it very soon. Blade Runner 2049 is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across the world, and every bit of it is deserved. Aside from being very long, this is pretty much a perfect film if you don't try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that aren't blatantly answered. If you know what type of film you're in for, or you've at least seen the original and enjoyed it, I can't recommend this movie enough.\",\n",

       "  \"Let me describe the sequence of Blade Runner 2049 for youHere goes:Enter the cinema with an overpriced orange juice that is mandatory because in the last couple of years Hollywood has decided it is artsy and de rigueur to make films longer than 2 hours. The lights dim and commercials kick in for 10 minutes. A game for pre-teens wasting daddy's money on mobile phones and plans kicks in. 2 minutes of endorsements for GM trucks (with some guy whose tone is so macho I roll my eyes) follows. Then there is a reminder to get the right debit card to be hip and in. Then the film follows for a whopping 3 hours almost. You would think that there was a lot happening and we were kept excited. Alas, the only thing that kept me awake was the very periodical appearance of a beautiful eye candy whether real, hologram or laser show version that would keep things exciting.If it were not for the sexy and lovable women Blade Runner 2049 was inane. Yes, inane. Apparently, not every film needs a sequel, a lesson Hollywood didn't learn from Hangover.The script was so corny and the words so elementary one would be excused for thinking this is a practical joke. Head of police, yes head of police is told a big lie by a contractor, head of police believes it and all is good. No double checking, no verifying, no details asked no proof required. it is a matter of life and death for the order of the world and, of OK, let's keep rolling guys. The ending was also a joke. A vehicle is drowning and the hero is being drowned but in the last second kills the bad gal and swims back to the vehicle to mount a rescue (for the sequels that will follow). Replicants can have and make babies, but how? Oh well, watch the prequel Blade Runner Rogue Uno, which is coming out in 2020.At that point all I wanted in life was to buy my own Joi and Luv and go back home.\",\n",

       " ['After being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians - most notably \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Rocketman\" and \"Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story\" - it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict (though desirable) biographical approach. That is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous; I came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of The Beatles, and their music, through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all. Quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing.On another level, the film made a satire of the modern music industry. It revealed how the apparent \"solo\" artists are far from their titles; with huge teams of people pushing them in a preferred, and more commercial, creative direction, taking the musicians\\' creative power. This was done in a humorous light (as most themes are presented in the film). The romantic aspect of the film is evident from the beginning and is a dominant aspect of the story, possibly shifting the focus of the piece a little too much. However, it still helps provides a satisfying ending.The film pays a great amount of respect in a fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts.',\n",

Was he going to get the girl, lose the girl? So many movies are fixated on realism and difficulties and negativity. Yes, he faces several difficulties. But, the movie is light and beautiful with fantastic music. If I want realism, I watch a documentary. This is what I go to the movies for. Really well done!',\n",
       "  'There are some movies that when released simply don\\'t need a big marketing campaign. Just a few words of description of the plot are enough to put it on your \"must see\" list: \"A struggling musician has a cycling accident during a freak global blackout and wakes to a world where noone other than him remembers the Beatles or any of their songs.\" When I heard this I said to myself \"yes, Yes, YES\"! But would it live up to my expectations?This is a Richard Curtis penned film, and that\\'s immediately enough to put a tranche of movie-goers off. All his movies have an accent on the uplifting, the positive and/or the whimsical, and I can understand why that winds some people up. If \"Richard-Curtissy\" was an adjective, and I think it should be, many of these films can be so classified.Here, although again very Richard-Curtissy, I think he gets the mixture JUST RIGHT.... \"Yesterday\", for me, was a complete joy from beginning to end.I imagine Curtis getting this story from a rowdy dinner party round his gaff. He asks his guests, over the third bottle of dessert wine, to play a wild and fantastical \"what if\" game (in pursuit of the \"very good\" spare brownie of course). At this particular event, I guess it was co-story-author Jack Barth (in his movie-writing debut) that made the successful attempt to \"hog the brownie\". For the premise of \"Yesterday\" is quite brilliant, whilst at the same time being utterly bonkers too!That being said, the story is not completely original. I thought there were many similarities to the Ricky Gervais vehicle of 2009, \"The Invention of Lying\", where Gervais alone finds he suddenly has the ability to tell lies, and finds ill-gotten fortune and fame as a result. Much like that earlier film, much of the joy here is in the recognition of the gift given and the dawning realisation of what this might actually mean to him. As such, I found the first half of the film a lot more enjoyable than the second.The conundrum facing Jack is to remeber all of the Beatles songs and their lyrics (without having Google as a reference), and much fun is had with him stumbling into situations that suddenly remind him of a new track or a particular snatch of lyric.There is of course an obvious explanation for the whacky storyline, since the hero has received a potentially serious head injury. But would the film go there? (No spoilers here).Himesh Patel is from TV\\'s \"Eastenders\" but here makes his movie debut. He is perfectly cast as Jack Malik: in the film, he\\'s a name about to rise from utter obscurity as a Lowestoft retail assistant to global superstardom. Patel is charming and believable as he squirms with his conscience. A surprising and touching beach scene in the final reel of the film is exquisitely acted.The ever-watchable and utterly gorgeous Lily James here goes brunette: she was actually unrecognisable to me from both the trailer and the poster! Here she makes a very believable high-school teacher with a side-line in management and roadie-ing.I found Ed Sheeran\\'s cameo in \"Bridget Jones Baby\" to be excruciating! But here, in what is quite an extensive part, he is much, much better. I think he\\'s been getting lessons.One of the slight disappointments with the film is that it is a Danny Boyle film that doesn\\'t FEEL like a Danny Boyle film. Aside from some inventive on-screen titles, I didn\\'t detect much of the stylisation that I would expect from one of his films. Yes, there are occasional flashes of genius - for example, the scenes where Malik is desperately trying to remember the lyrics of Eleanor Rigby, and those of him watching, big screen, his own social-media led rise to super stardom. But otherwise, the visuals and storyline are pretty linear in nature.Although there are cloyingly gooey bits of this film, the element that weaves it all together - such that \"all is forgiven\" in my book - is the magical music and lyrics of McCartney, Lennon and Harrison.Was there a better year to be born that 1961? (Well, possibly the mid- to late- 50\\'s so you were old enough to remember more of it). But although only a child aged between two and nine during their album releases, I felt the benefit of three older siblings who WERE able to fully embrace Beatlemania. And the film delights with its modern day recreations of the classic tracks and, as already mentioned, Himesh Patel belts them out wonderfully (especially, I thought, with \"Help!\").I can\\'t not give this one 10 stars. I simply loved it, and can\\'t wait for its general release (in the UK, on June 28th 2019) so I can go and love it all over again. Is it technically a 10-star film? Possibly not, but sometimes you just have to go with the way a film makes you feel, not just as you walk, whistling, out of the cinema but for the whole of the next 48 hours and (I suspect) longer. In summary, he loves it. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeeaaaaaah\".(This is an edited version. The full graphical review is available on \"One Mann\\'s Movies\" on t\\'internet or Facebook.

       "  'It was a great idea and in some ways the film made the vision work. I just don\\'t think they did enough with it though and instead fell back into the traditional love story formula. The music helped carry a lot of it through (unsurprisingly). What they missed was it wasn\\'t necessarily the songs themselves but the era in which they came out and the meaning of the time. Movie just presented it as almost instant stardom if today\\'s world heard the songs which lets be honest today\\'s generation wouldn\\'t understand half of it. It didn\\'t really present a clear vision of \"why\" which I was looking for towards the end to help tie things up. Lights go off on the planet he takes a bump on the head then the Beatles never existed? Alternate universe? Dream? Thought there would\\'ve been something more there. There were a few things that bothered me with the story that the movie made it seem like they were pieces to the puzzle but then never did anything with them. First is through the film he also finds out other things don\\'t exist as well such as coke, cigarettes, the band oasis, and Harry Potter. It seemed like these things were going to connect into the story and why the Beatles music isn\\'t present but they just left it there and he kind of says \"oh well\" and nothing comes of it. The second was he finds out there are two others that also know the Beatles music and again seems like this should be a big part of the story to tie things together as to a bit of \"why\" but they just have a conversation about it she gives him an address and then that\\'s it. His conversation with what I think is supposed to be John Lennon didn\\'t make sense either. Does that mean the other 4 exist? Did they never meet to make music? Just all added up to a great idea that worked early in the film but didn\\'t follow through properly. All my opinion of course',\n",

The alternative world scenario sounded truly fascinating, one of the most fascinating concepts in recent years to me and a refreshing change from the remakes and sequels constantly made today. Like to love a lot of Danny Boyle\\'s previous films and find him a talented director. The Beatles are not all time favourites but do appreciate him highly, understand their influence in music and like a lot of their songs a lot.While it could have done more with its concept, \\'Yesterday\\' turned out to still be entertaining and charming that put me and my sister in an uplifting mood leaving the cinema. Had not had an easy day, or week even, up to seeing the film, so \\'Yesterday\\' was a much needed and appreciated antidote. As far as films released in 2019 go, it is neither one of the best or worst in a hit and miss year and somewhere around solid middle if having to rank.\\'Yesterday\\' is a slick looking film, not exemplary but never cheap. Lily James looks great and the camera clearly loves her. The music of course is fantastic, it is The Beatles after all, with some of their greatest hits exuberantly performed, making one want to sing along regardless of whether they know all the words or not. \"Hey Jude\" is one of the most memorable examples. The script balances amusing comedy and never over-sentimental drama without making it too cartoonish or mawkish (well mostly).Story-wise, \\'Yesterday\\' captures the feel-good spirit affectionately and the portrayal of the music industry was fun and didn\\'t get over the top. The John Lennon bit is a highlight. Boyle has done better and more inspired direction, but still directs at a crisp pace and balances things quite well. The performances are good, a truly charming James coming off best. Himesh Patel has come on a long way since \\'EastEnders\\' while Kate McKinnon is riotous in the manager role.On the other viewpoint, the concept was so fascinating and while it is always engaging the story is predictable and a bit too ordinary. Especially the final third, which is pretty much exactly as one would expect.Ed Sheeran\\'s \"extended cameo\" for my tastes was rather puzzling and didn\\'t seem to gel with everything else.All that aside, it was an enjoyable film on the whole and worth seeing. 7/10',\n",

But, as with writer Richard Curtis\\'s other films (About Time), there\\'s a unique ethical question underscoring the surface: what rights does an artist have over a creation they didn\\'t create? Should we be honest about \"reality\" when that reality isn\\'t reality? Confused? Don\\'t worry; that complexity is all but completely brushed under the rug here, opting instead for cheap explanations and corny romance.\\nBecause of unimportant and uninteresting reasons, an aspiring musician (Patel) discovers he is the only person in the world who remembers The Beatles. Patel is great in the lead; with impeccable timing and effortless charm, he manages to steal all these classic songs without losing our sympathy. He\\'s supported by a handful of genuinely funny and sweet moments: jokes at the expense of Oasis and Ed Sheeran, the reveals of other erased cultural touchstones (Coca-Cola, Harry Potter, etc), even a surprisingly moving reveal of others who remember the past. Unfortunately, the story doesn\\'t do much to help. Lazy storytelling shortcuts are taken at every turn, making a fantastical concept even more difficult to believe.\\nCurtis is usually quite adept with this type of rom-dramedy, but he\\'s not at the helm here. Boyle is, and he\\'s known for his hyper-stylized direction, which proves problematic. Where he spends time working on montages of ridiculous metaphorical storytelling devices, he should be fleshing out character motivations and ethical conundrums.

But the movie is globally disappointing with a certain flatness and a script suffering from a blatant lack of originality: the « Twilight Zone » effect has been seen again and again so many times. In fact, by being slightly in bad faith, the film Yesterday (2019) can almost be reduced to the Beatles songs.

But unlike Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman which are biography movies. Yesterday is a fantasy comedy movie which is a different take from the previous two. Did the movie deliver or did the movie disappoint. After seeing the first trailer back in February I was very interested in the its unique concept of the movie.The plot for the movie centers around Jack Malek who is a struggling musician until he had a bus crash while power was turned off about 12 seconds he then finds out that he is the only person who knows the songs of the Beatles.The movie delivered on its premised in a lot of levels. The performances by Himesh Patel and Lily James was excellent they had great chemistry and you can feel their friendship grew throughout the movie. I thought Ed Sheeran wasn't that bad in the movie and he was a lot better than I expecting considering that most real life musicians acting was mostly bad. The movie featured lots of classic Beatles which was great even though Let It Be was on briefly I was expecting a full version of the record in the movie. But that didn't ruin the whole movie. The ending of movie was very moving and emotional don't going to say anything about the ending but it was lovely ending.Overall the movie was excellent it was original but unlike a lot of original movies that has a great premise but didn't deliver this movie does deliver with great performances and a wonderful ending this movie is to enjoy by everyone who loves the the Beatles or just want to have a great fun time at the cinema.

Childhood sweethearts never expressed love for each other, then something happens, their relationship gets strained, until love wins and is declared publicly.This isn\\'t a whodunnit, you can guess the ending from the trailer. You will have seen countless films like this and you come to expect everything that happens to happen. Just as you expect a chorus after a verse in a Beatles song. Or any other pop song.But within that outer layer there is a very interesting subject that the film explores: what if we lost something that brings us all together? What if we didn\\'t have a shared cultural experience to which we all give the same meaning?When the blackout happens, the Beatles are not the only thing that disappears from public memory: Jack googles \"coke\" and the search engine - which is what gives Meaning these days - displays a picture of Pablo Escobar. So when Jack asks a waitress for coke, it is not a ubiquitous beverage that the woman thinks of.And so Jack finds himself with the opportunity to gain fame and riches by appropriating what had been a pillar of our post-war popular culture globally: the Beatles catalogue. Because the true premise of the film is this: everyone likes the Beatles. And Beatles songs therefore can be used by us all to communicate with each other.Soon though Jack finds that the music has lost its universal meaning for the people who now appreciate \"his\" music. He is confronted with the ruthless pragmatism of the music industry, all the while being isolated by his alien cultural baggage and climb to fame.So when he reunites with the only two other people unaffected by the blackout, he finds that meaning again, and the plot finally twists.This isn\\'t a film about the Beatles\\' music, it isn\\'t a documentary about their legacy - it\\'s a film about a world suddenly losing shared experience, about losing a \"consensus\" that brought us together.That\\'s why I thought the ending, the other part of the ending, the one I\\'m not going to spoil, was so uplifting and progressive.

I'll definitely buy the DVD.\\nAs an aside, if we are supposed to write twenty lines at least in these reviews, how come some of these reviews only contain two lines?\",\n",
       "  \"Danny Boyle is a director that I usually like, but unfortunately this film disappointed me. I thought it was very cliched and filled to the brim with tropes and bad, cringeworthy dialogue. I thought the acting was good, and the premise was interesting, but they don't live up to the potential of that premise. Because rather than exploring the interesting questions that this premise entails like how the world, the music industry, and our understanding of music would change if The Beatles were never a thing, they instead just use this as a strange, needlessly complex way of telling a by the books romance. Overall I wouldn't exactly recommend this film, and I was pretty disappointed.\",\n",
       "  'Sat with a big smile on my face the entire time. \"A world without The Beatles is a world that is infinitely worse\"',\n",
       "  'Yesterday tells the story of Jack, an amateur musician who is trying to break into the industry with the help of his best friend Ellie, but when he gets hit by a truck riding his bike home one night, he wakes up in an alternate universe where several things have turned out to have never existed, but most importantly the Beatles and their songs. Jack decides to take advantage of this, and uses the Beatles\\' music to launch his career, becoming the most famous pop star in the world.That premise sounds great, and I was looking forward to a surreal comedy, but to be honest, it doesn\\'t quite live up to it, instead getting distracted by what the actual main plot turned out to be: a cliche romantic comedy with the childhood friend that is secretly in love with the protagonist, only for him to figure it out for himself later.The best moments of this film are to do with the central premise of the alternate universe, where Jack would reference something, only for the people around him to say \"what\\'s that?\" I mean, it\\'s the same joke in different words basically every time, but hey, the way they execute it is pretty good. There are also some decent satirical moments with Jack interacting with the music industry, personified by Jack\\'s manager, and an extended cameo by Ed Sheeran, who falls victim to some self-deprecating jokes, but overall seems to be the secondary \\'star\\' of the show besides the Beatles\\' music.Speaking of the Beatles, you\\'d be surprised by how little they actually contribute to the plot. For a film that is named after one of their more famous songs, you\\'d think that their music and impact to society would be more than just a plot device for the main character to achieve his success. There\\'s no real commentary as to why the Beatles music is so great, you\\'re just told, over and over again, that they\\'re the greatest band ever, and that a world without them ever existing would suck. Sure, that is something I would agree with, but the film doesn\\'t really add much of their own perspective to that side of the story, it just takes that idea as fact.The romance is decent, but cliche and overall unremarkable. Screenwriter Richard Curtist definitely knows how to write romances, having written several well regarded romcoms, like Love Actually and About Time, but I would say that Yesterday isn\\'t quite up to that standard. Same goes for Danny Boyle and the other films he directed compared to this. The direction isn\\'t bad, but it\\'s bland and doesn\\'t really add much to the story. There are some weird shots, like some weird dutch angles near the beginning of the story that seem out of place, but nothing else unusual or amazing about the camerawork either.I guess if you like romcoms and Beatles music, this movie will definitely be watchable, but for me, as a person who doesn\\'t actively seek out that genre, this film didn\\'t stand out to me in either direction, and overall I\\'m disappointed that they didn\\'t take full advantage of the great premise.',\n",

The Beatles are the biggest selling band in the world, if they didn't exist the world deservers to hear their music.\\nHowever above all loved the underlying message; success doesn't also have to be about the money you make and tell the truth at every possible opportunity you get.I can't wait for this film to be released on DVD so I can watch it again and again.\"],\n",

Well, wow!I'm shocked at some of the negative reviews so far. It goes to show you that you can't please everyone. It's either too Hollywood-ish or not Hollywood enough lol.Here's why I REALLY liked it; For starters, this is actor Andrea Di Stefano second ever attempt at directing and writing, and compared to some of the films that have come out lately - and from seasoned writer and directors, he nailed it. Was it flawless? No. But considering is wasn't a big budget Hollywood production with seasoned filmmakers and with all lead cast being A-listers, but instead a British-made B-grade film with newb filmmakers, this was produced exceptionally well and is a winner imo.I found the story very realistic and un-Hollywood-ish, which is refreshing for a change. Sure this story has been done many times before, but this one felt authentic. The last time I saw this type of genre movie that surprised and impressed me, was Shot Caller.Casting was perfect, with all leads playing their respective roles on point, especially Joel Kinnaman who nailed his character.Cinematography was great, the score/sound was fitting, and the production/location sets authentic. My only critique would be the pacing needed picking up in some parts, and/or the 113 min run-time trimmed down at least 10-15 mins.Aside from that, this was one of the best B-grade films I've seen, with its unpredictable plot turn at every corner, excellent central performances, all packaged really well by an newbie filmmaker. It's a solid 9/10 from me!To see any of my 1000+ ratings and 700+ reviews, click on my username.\",\n",

Rosamund Pike continues to prove what a great actor she is with a performance that echoes her character in Beirut. Joel Kinnaman gives a performance that is just as conflicted and compelling as Altered Carbon. Altogether a great cast that manages to build realistic characters. My only criticism of the script is the overly detailed explanation of fentanyl that Pike gives to her team on FBI agents - it's the only point where you feel the film patronises the audience. Other than that, a thoroughly enjoyable movie.\",\n",

It was like reading an Elmore Leonard story but without the humour. I understand that the UK did a good job of standing in for New York. What a surprise because it did feel like the Big Apple. I liked the flow of the film. You did not always follow what was going on - I'm still not sure of the role played by the drugs in the tulips - but the scenes did not linger. The film was a little open-ended. If the make The Informer 2, I would buy a ticket for it.\",\n",
       "  'The informer\\n2019\\n15\\ndirector: Andrea De stefano\\nstarring: Joel Kinnamon,Rosamund pike,Ana de armas,Common,Clive own etcoverall rating 73/100When ex convict Pete coslow gets involved with a shooting of a NYPD cop. He has to go back to prison in order to stop a drug gang from getting away with there crimes. But the lifes of his wife and child is at risk and its up to officer wilcox ( rosamund pike) to help him be reunited with his family. The informer was a good thriller but a flawed film, but still thoroughly entertaining lets get into why this is.First of all the film did a fantastic job of delivering an incredibly tense tone. The film did a fantastic job with keeping you on the edge of your seat. in fact i think this is up there with the most tense and unsettling films of the year in my opinion. The film just put the audience through so many uncomfortable situations. and with the lack of soundtrack it really helped with the authenticity of the film. Whether it was being attacked in the prison or in my opinion the most uncomfortable scene when the main characters wife and child was being gagged and threatened. Also the violence and gore helped with the entertainment value of the film. But also added to the tense tone and impact of each scene with a heads up some very gory things that were borderline 18 rating in my opinion.however my first issue is the slow pacing in the first half of the film. In my opinion the first half of the film was very slow and made me lose interest a few times. There was just a lot of filler conversations and standing around that left me needing something to spice the film up and make it more entertaining. But luckily they more then redeemed themselves in the second half of the film where it had a absolutely fantastic final act. They really went all out in the last half of the film to make you care about all of the characters and to keep you on the edge of your seat. With all the action was non stop within the last 30/45 minutes of the film so this more then made up for the first half of the film.Next i think the informer had a good amount of emotional weight to it. The fact that Joel Kinnamons character. Just wanted to get to his family and the love he showed them really made his character more respected in my opinion. And you related to him a bit more because most people are close to there families so being away from them is hard so everyone could\\npassively relate to his emotional state with his wife and kid.Next i think they really portrayed the harsh reality of prison life really well. A lot of films with prisons in can be very tame with what they show maybe due to the age rating but this film. Showed the types of people the horrible conditions that prisoners rightly have to go through so this was just a nice touch to see. However i do have to say that the film was very stereotypical with what type if inhabitants take up prisons. I think having a lot of the prisoners black and to have it split by colour is fairly old fashioned and they should of picked a more diverse group of people.Now my final two positives would be the fantastic acting was Joel Kinnamon and Rosamund pike. Rosamund pike was fantastic in the cop role. She was clever and did not take no for a answer whilst also having a kind heart and a nag for doing the right thing. And joel Kinnamon showed great diversity in the film. His character had a great blend of intimidation,vulnerability and perseverance and despite maybe not agreeing with some of his actions largely he was a character that you could support.However i do have to end on my final two negatives. First of all there was next to no character development or depth to most of the characters. Most of the characters were very one dimensional. And Petes wife did next to nothing in the film apart from being Petes motivation she was just a damsel in distress which was a shame considering the films of today with strong female characters. And finally there was some incredibly dislikable characters. Some of joels workmates who killed policemen and threatened his wife and kid were just sick and really made you not like there characters. I know this was the goal but for whatever reason something was off about some of the characters that really made you question the reasoning for them being there in the script.Overall the informer is a thoroughly entertaining and tense thriller with excellent acting. But is narratively flawed and could used with more developed and likeable characters.',\n",
       "  \"Joel Kinnaman is about the only thing holding this together. He's an excellent actor and if you like him, this is worth watching. the movie is at times suspenseful but Hollywood seems to have given up on creating anything even slightly realistic. This movie is absurd and as it goes on, only gets more absurd. Towards the end I was actually laughing which isn't a good sign when the movie is suppose to be a dramatic thriller. Worth a watch for Joel or if you have nothing else to watch.\",\n",

The story revolves around a military veteran involved in a drug ring being investigated by the FBI and the NYPD.Unfortunately virtually no time is spent on character introduction / development which makes it hard to care about any of the main protagonists. It's just a series of improbable scenes which bear virtually no relation to each other. It doesn't help that the audio mixing is terrible rendering much of the dialogue unintelligible.Joel Kinnaman does his best to portray a believable character, but Clive Owen is his usual wooden self. The other characters are completely forgettable.This could have been a decent film but the production and editing are dreadful and completely fail to tell a compelling or even coherent story. 2/10 and that's being generous.\",\n",

Not a good start as in many ways the film rested on him.2, the cinematography was good and helped the tension and narrative flow.What was problematic1, too little variety in the movie, all we had was threat menace and betrayal2, the plot was labyrinthine, keep it simple.3, some of the turns were ridiculous, the NYPD cop arrived on his own to sort out a shoot out. The FBI had authority to act and then tried to conceal their actions. Criminal gangs rarely accept new members so the police try to turn existing members. The hostage scene was absurd as any idiot can spot a prisoner from a guard.4, the informer's wife Sophia had the acting skills of a dead ant, the AB school of acting.5, the clash of theatre and method acting was so marked I laughed aloud.This was a boys movie with questionable acting and an absurd script, such a shame when you consider the calibre of actors involved.\",\n",

On one hand you have interesting plots for episodes, crazy situations, and twists and turns, and I'm the other you have predictable plots and writing. The acting was great, they made a smart move by getting actors that have worked on projects previously, and Wyatt Olef is perfect for his role. I enjoyed Sofia's performance as well, she really sold me on her character and her ability to change from being an angry or rude character to a charming and like able one is extremely impressive. I also loved Sofia Bryant, she was great for her role. All the acting was amazing so props to the casting director. One of my main complaints is the inconsistency with the episodes, some of the, were great, some were okay, and some I didn't like very much. This wouldn't be a problem if there were more episodes, but considering there are only 7 it was not convenient. The series doesn't drag along and the music is amazing. It perfectly fits the mood! I do feel like the last episode was the best one, and it made me feel like the story had just begun. That's another big problem. I felt like the first 6 episodes were all leading up to the real show. One good thing to come from this is that it made me want more from the show. The potential really shines through I'm the last episode and we get to see what the writers and directors can really do and I would have liked to see that more extreme tone through the season. I was suspecting something was going to happen but the scene really did leave me in shock. It was amazing! I want more of that in the show. My only advice for the writing team is do your research! Look at what other Netflix shows are doing and do not do that. That is the only way you're getting noticed. Break the cliché's! You've already started with having the protagonist having a crush on a girl. We rarely see a (possible) LGBTQ+ lead so props to you guys! Make something different and don't be afraid to take risks.

They\\'d just have Sydney have a bad day, have her powers blow up, and then repeat.Also for the first 4(Out of 7 episodes remember) Syd is just an absolute rude to the people who try to be nice to her (except Dina). For example, in the bowling alley scene, she makes light (and/or fun) of Stan\\'s abusive relationship with his dad (also doesn\\'t help that Stan seems a more interesting character than her)Now, I believe the show gets tremendously better from episodes 4-6. Syd gets to be more than just angry sad girl and gets to interact with Dina, Stan and her family in better ways and the story trajectory is looking very interesting.But they couldn\\'t stick the landing. And up until a point, I was loving the final episode. The characters are gelling together perfectly and the story\\'s climax is *chef\\'s kiss* Brad\\'s death is such an interesting way to take the story but the writer\\'s had to go and ruin it with the most lazy and CLICHE cliffhanger!I would\\'ve been perfectly fine if the show had just ended right there with Brad\\'s death. However the writer\\'s had to end it with that cheesy ass line \"Let\\'s begin\\'\\' (It reminded me of S7 Game of Thrones writing it was that bad) It ends the story abruptly and leaves me so unsatisfied.Now, overall I think this show is a solid 6/10 and I will definitely tune in to season 2 but goddamn I am so annoyed right now',\n",

       "  'The struggle was real. It was a constant fight to stay awake. Twice I succumbed to the Sandman only to wake up in the same dream. \"Gretel & Hansel\" tried to put me out again but I was determined to stay awake and torture myself.There\\'s no mystery what the premise of this movie is about. Everyone knows the age old story of \"Hansel & Gretel.\" A young brother and sister go into the woods, they find a house made of delicious treats, they eat from the house, get captured by a witch who fattens them up to eat them except they escape and kill her.The story has been retold, remixed, and redone several times both literarily and cinematically. The last cinematic version I saw was with Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton in \"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters\" (2013). That was more of a Hansel & Gretel the adult years where they hunt other witches to prevent other kids from getting eaten or worse.This version tries to go the scary route. It was dark and ominous the majority of the movie. They also wanted to give it a new age spin by making Gretel the main focus as you can probably gather by the title: \"Gretel & Hansel.\" They have followed the Hollywood trend of other movies that have taken known and established stories or franchises and remade them to have a feminine focus. Look no further than \"Star Wars,\" \"Terminator,\" \"Ghostbusters,\" \"Ocean\\'s 11,\" and others. It\\'s lazy and it\\'s a disservice. The movies are trash--not because they are feminine centric, but because writers are just rehashing something that has made goo gobs of money and gave them heroines as though that is somehow fresh, radical, or unique. It\\'s none of those. It\\'s tired, lazy, and lame. Do something new and original and maybe, just maybe, it will be good.In \"Gretel & Hansel\" Gretel was the older sister and, for the most part, caretaker of Hansel. While wandering the woods in a state of near starvation they found the witch\\'s house. The witch was a child eater, but she only wanted to eat Hansel and not Gretel. In Gretel she saw power and wanted to help her cultivate that power. Hansel, as the witch explained, was only weighing Gretel down. If she would only let him go, then she would be free. Read: if women would only discard the shackles known as men then they could realize their true potential. That same message was intimated elsewhere in the movie when Gretel called the witch \"misses\" and the witch said, \"I\\'m not married. Do you see a ball and chain on me.\"If the message wasn\\'t clear enough from the two aforementioned examples, then there were three men in the movie to make the \"male bad, female good\" message stronger. Of the three men, one was morally reprehensible, one was some sort of animal, and one was chivalrous. So, two of the three men were dangerous while one was good. If that was analogous to real life then that\\'s sad. I only hope that I\\'m of the 1/3rd that are good.Gretel finds the strength to save her brother from being eaten, but she also lets him go. The boy was all of nine years old at the oldest and yet he is a male so she had to cut him loose to be the goddess she was meant to be. It\\'s a pathetic retelling of a classic in which neither Hansel nor Gretel was the dominant character. Maybe one day Hollywood writers will be creative for a change. And maybe pigs will fly.',\n",

       " [\"IT truly is the scariest movie of all time... If you're 10 years old or younger, maybe.I honestly am shocked by all the positive reviews and high rotten tomatoes score. Did I see a completely different movie? IT starts off very well with a genuinely good opening scene. Great cinematography, atmosphere, lighting, a likable child whom you connect with easily, and an interesting encounter takes place between this kid and a very creepy clown. The dialogue is good, there is an eerie sense of dread, and a moment where IT aka Pennywise goes from being a friendly-ish clown to a terrifying villain in an instant through a very well placed awkward stare. It was a moment I wasn't expecting and gave me hope for the rest of the film, then... It's all downhill from there, after an almost laughable use of CG. This movie has big issues. IT isn't scary. IT's story is weak, if you can even call it a story. IT has too many underdeveloped characters. And IT is a counterproductive villain with no concrete rules for what IT can or can not do.The overuse of CG ruined any sense of tension or fear and Pennywise's tactics didn't make sense. If he feeds off fear, why reveal himself to each of the kids within a close time period? Why not concentrate on each child individually, causing far more mental torment and making them an easier kill? Pennywise also just randomly manifests himself anywhere at anytime, and disappears randomly. I don't find it scary when the antagonist manifests itself, attacks a character and right before doing damage IT vanishes..The story is a mess and there are far too many characters. I swear the first 40 minutes is the longest montage in film history. A montage of each child's development and exposure to Pennywise. It was predictable and monotonous. As for the story, I don't know what to say, besides there really isn't one. Character motivations are weak, Bill is the only one who makes sense. Where were the parents at? Not a single parent seemed to care about their missing children. The few on screen parents there were, came off as caricatures. And there were a few scenes that felt completely pointless within context of the story. The school bully and his dad, being the oddest.So in closing, IT is an uneven movie or more accurately a collection of scenes that don't flow well in a tangible story. There are some good laughs, and a few entertaining scenes. But all in all it's just an average movie. Which should've been an evident sign, when the original attached director Cary Fukunaga jumped ship.\",\n",
       "  'The opening scene is good. From there on...not as much.I guess this movie will please those not familiar with the book much more than those who are. That being said, I don\\'t think it is possible to make a satisfying adaption of \"It\" without doing it the Game of Thrones way. More time is needed to dwell on each of the novel\\'s parts to create the feel the book gave us. To tell the story as it was told on paper. So I guess I\\'ll forgive the filmmakers for that.The kids are okay. They\\'ve managed to portray the losers and the relationship between them decently enough- considering the running time. Again: more time is needed for better development. Much of what actually happened between the kids and It has been cut, but again - running time. They had to.That they\\'ve changed the setting from the 1958 to the 80s was a bad choice, and so are the other changes. They\\'re creating scenes that aren\\'t in the book. They\\'re changing things that are there. The biggest problem I have with the film is the execution of the horror. Constant jump scares, way too much CGI, and a complete lack of understanding of the fact that less is more. Waiting for a scare is the scary part of horror, and this movie just throws everything at you constantly. It just isn\\'t terrifying. At all.I didn\\'t find myself bored, though. Besides the poor performance when it came to being scary, it is an okay movie. It just isn\\'t a good adaptation.',\n",
       "  'I think the film was good, but didn\\'t really live up to expectations. I didn\\'t find it that scary. Admittedly, one of the jump scares worked on me but otherwise I never felt any dread looming in the pit of my stomach. The film is gorier than the mini series. That\\'s for sure. And I liked that updated aspect, but nothing particularly shocked me. There was quite a bit of special effects that just were not very good. And I think that\\'s a big reason why I just wasn\\'t very scared.The other dumb thing I want to mention is that sometimes the characters fell into predictable horror movie tropes. Its just kind of silly when they\\'ve already been scared by Pennywise many times. Knows this all \"isn\\'t real\" and yet will wander off by one of the missing kids going \"Come here\". I mean, really? You\\'re going to fall for that? I think what does save this film are the performances. Bill does a good job with Pennywise. However, he does lack the charm that Tim Curry had. But those were always going to be big shoes to fill. (Clown pun not intended). The kids though were amazing. In particular Jaeden Lieberher (who played Bill) and Sophia Lillis (who played Bev) were the standouts. I also want to give a shoutout to Nicholas Hamilton (who played Henry) for managing to make me feel empathy for a bully. Finn Wolfhard (from Stranger Things) plays Richie who is meant to be the jokester of the group. And Finn does well with that character. I just wish the writers had laid off from the jokes some of the times. You\\'re supposed to be building tension and it kind of gets ruined when he opens his mouth to make a joke about period blood or whatever.I see the potential in this film. And I think it could have been really good. I just think they spent too much focus on \"shock value\" rather than building on an atmosphere.',\n",

I will say that the cinematography, the location, and the children (The Losers Club) hold up really well for this film. Yet, I\\'m still sitting here after seeing this premiere and I\\'m still shaking my head. Here is the one thing for me, that ruined the movie. If you don\\'t want any spoilers I suggest you stop reading. Here goes..What is going on with all the CGI in this film? Computer animated graphics have never scared me and this movie is littered with seemingly terrible and unimpressive visual effects. I had a feeling this was going to happen after watching the directors previous film \"Mama\" Anytime something was seemingly scary, or anytime I thought \"Hey, this movie might redeem itself\" it was almost instantaneously followed by some cheap jump scare with a villain who was computer animated to look scary. The human eye is easy to detect how fake CGI can be and folks, let me tell you, this movie relies INCREDIBLY HEAVILY on computer animated effects. No incredible monster movie effects from the 80s here. The sad part about it is that the movie takes place in the 80s (instead of the 50s like the book). What better way to write a beautiful love letter to the time period than to get some natural, realistic, and horrifying movie effects? The 70s had The Exorcist. Top notch REAL effects. Do you remember The Thing from the 1980s? ThHOSE PRACTICAL EFFECTS STILL HOLD UP TO THIS DAY. Its truly sad to see computer programs taking the forefront to create scares. Anyway, I\\'m rambling...For all of you fans of the book out there.. Spoiler alert again..You WILL be disappointed. It only uses the book as a small guideline for the story they decided to craft here. There is no Ritual of Chud. There is no Mummy, Werewolf, or drowned children in the Standpipe. Everything is rushed. This film is just a complete mess and it pains me to say so. If you haven\\'t read the book, maybe you\\'ll have a decent time if you can handle CGI. I for one thought IT was extremely disappointing, confusing, and ultimately boring and cliché. God, I wish this could have gone a different way.If you are truly interested in seeing IT... Please...please.... Save your money and go see something else. Or at the very least, wait to rent it.',\n",

There was only one scene in the entire movie that felt like this and it was the bathroom scene with Beverly. That was literally it (no pun intended). The clown was so cliché when it comes to cheap horror movie antics of the 2,000's.

Absolutely NOTHING scary about the clown. If Tim Curry weren't in a wheel chair I would have rather had him come back and take the place of Penny Wise without ANY CGI. All of the CGI made this movie pure CRAP. The script writing was ridiculous and felt like it had been pushed through the works entirely too fast. Each kids fear was super cheesy and AGAIN, nothing but CGI on the tackiest scale they could have ever done.

The story is more than a gore-fest, it\\'s a story about love and hope and friendship that is still meaningful to me to this day.The only thing this movie has in common with the beloved book, is its name and the characters names. IT is a literal disaster and a slap in the face to anyone who actually read and cherishes the book. There are NO character backstories, nor character development at all. You are literally thrust into the movie expecting to know everything about everyone and why they are the way they are. IE: Henry Bowers and why he hates the \"Losers Club\" - He LITERALLY starts the movie trying to kill them. This is sad, because a large portion of the novel was meticulously spent doing quite the opposite and made you relate to and fall in love with the characters.Editing? What editing? This is the worst edited movie I\\'ve ever seen in my life and I\\'ve seen a lot in 41 years. It was literally like the film makers shot 100 scenes, put the film in a hat, and took out said scenes and spliced them together at total random. I can\\'t describe it any other way than saying, at one point, one of the characters (I can\\'t tell who, because they all share the EXACT same personality) says, \"I banged your mom last night\", or something similar, and before the audience can even react, the scene changes to a jump scare happening in ANOTHER PART OF TOWN INSTANTLY and with no rhyme or reason. You don\\'t have time to laugh at jokes, because they aren\\'t funny (unlike Stephen King\\'s jokes in the book) - and you don\\'t have time to be scared, because you\\'re still trying to process the dick joke that was still being told when the scene abruptly ended.While the filming location for the town of Derry was suitable, having the movie take place in the 1980\\'s instead of the 1950\\'s JUST TO APPEASE the \"Stranger Things\" crowd was simply a terrible decision. The 1950\\'s were a totally different time, and much of the characters\\' reasoning and mannerisms that you need to make this movie work are lost to a time and cultural difference. These guys call themselves \"THE LOSERS SQUAD\" in this movie for god\\'s sake! Kids didn\\'t start calling themselves a \"squad\" until the 1980\\'s (IE \"The Monster Squad) So, you love the book like me and are still reading? Thank you!

       "  'I\\'m a huge fan of the 1990\\'s TV film of \"It\", especially for its aesthetics and soundtrack, but it left out a lot of content from the original novel, leaving me confused when I first saw it at the age of 12. This remake, or perhaps actually a \"re-adaptation\", is certainly very timely, what with \"Stranger Things\" becoming so huge with pretentious hipsters everywhere. I\\'m still not sure it hits the \"scary\" factor very well, especially without Tim Curry\\'s tremendous acting, but it\\'s certainly creepy. It\\'s not nostalgic though, nor does it retain much of the original novel, including the 50\\'s setting, changed to the 80\\'s to obviously market itself with \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Goonies\".My problem with this new adaptation of \"It\" is that it\\'s addled with CGI and jump scares, neither of which add to its nostalgic appeal. At the risk of sounding like a film snob, if you\\'re trying to make a film set decades before this era, you don\\'t use CGI at all if you can avoid it, unless you really know how to camouflage it. The constant profanity did nothing for the story either, it only gave the false illusion of being edgy. Yes, the book had profanity, but King knew where to draw the line and keep the perfect balance of immature vulgarity and true friendship. The sheer level of nerdiness here made me cringe, unlike the TV movie which had genuine friendships and sweet moments of love and joy amidst the horror, just like King\\'s novel. Did one of those boys seriously just say \"Get me my bifocals, I hid them in my second fanny pack\"? What the hell kind of child wears bifocals? Why not just rename him Poindexter while they\\'re at it? The kids in the book and the miniseries were never this obnoxiously dorky. And what\\'s with all this New Kids on the Block stuff? There was a scene in which for no apparent reason all these close-ups of NKOTB posters pop up on-screen. Why? Just because earlier in the film a kid had been listening to that music? It made no sense! We get loads of terrible one liners from Richie comparing the blood in the sewers to \"period blood\" (lovely, eh?) and trust me, no way does any thirteen-year-old talk like this. All kids at that age swear and tell fart jokes and stuff, but even they have their limits.Mike is only added as an afterthought, which seems borderline offensive, as if they only added him as a token minority whereas in the book and film he was such a complex, central character. He had a strong bond with his father that\\'s totally absent from this film. Stan is unlikable, and the newly revamped Pennywise the Clown has teeth that could rival the most inbred hillbilly, and the most scary thing he seems to be able to do is hop around like some kind of wino. Uh yeah, real \"spooky\", I\\'m shaking in my boots. Then we have the film\\'s complete disregard for the friendship, the glue that holds the story together. Killing and gore and sex and violence and swearing is not what horror is about, it\\'s about the darker side of life, and this film only portrays it in a cheesy slasher film type of way. I\\'m not trying to sound preachy, but where\\'s the love and friendship between the characters? When it is there (which isn\\'t very often) it feels forced. In the old miniseries, it felt authentic and true, and the kids were actually portrayed as kids, not young adults. This new film is completely void of the book\\'s special qualities such as the \"hi-ho Silver!\" thing and Eddie\\'s \"battery acid\" line. The film just doesn\\'t have the stunning scenery that the miniseries had, either. The miniseries had an actual gothic revival pump house as the sewer building (the Buntzen Hydroelectric Station of British Columbia), and it was creepy and nostalgic and absolutely the perfect choice. It had nailed down the industrial small town in an economic slump kind of look perfectly, too. This film looks too clean for that, with CGI used in all the wrong places to create what looks like fake looking stage sets.This film isn\\'t completely terrible. It passes the time, but the only thing it has going for it is that the director thinks he has hit some 80\\'s vibe gold mine when in reality it just looked like a bad video game full of childish jump scares. I was hoping it might be more like the 2012 film Sinister, a genuinely frightening and timeless boogeyman that leaves a subtle unsettling presence wherever it goes, but no, it just looked cheap and lazy, an obvious cash grab that\\'s being WAY overhyped. A 7.5/10 rating, are you kidding me? Even King\\'s 1995 notoriously bad film The Mangler was better than this! It\\'s like with good marketing, this new film was able to pull the wool over everybody\\'s eyes and fool them into thinking it was a classic masterpiece.',\n",
       "  \"The opening scene of IT is so promising - well directed, atmospheric, and Skarsgard's clown is compelling to watch. There is a brief moment where while laughing mutually with the kid, the clown suddenly goes quiet and stares menacingly. Its brilliantly unsettling. But sadly, that's it as far as unsettling clown performances go - the rest of the film is typical CGI scares, and the clown throwing out taunts like the deriative satire of Scary Terry in Rick and Morty. The cinematography and acting is great. Its watchable in an afternoon Netflix kind of way. But there is no real gist, goal or drive to the story, it all just sort of unfolds scene after scene, goalless and drifty like the string-along nature of a Police Academy film. Its OK - but it really isn't the classic that people are making out to be. Its been incredibly over-hyped. I personally found Insidious to be a far more effective supernatural chiller.\",\n",
       "  \"I managed to win a preview screening to 'IT' on the 30th of August, in Sydney. I had high expectations for this film - and IT exceeded them. The acting. Great performances all round. The kids had great chemistry, and you really believe that they were all great friends. It reminded me of Stand By Me and The Goonies. Out of the child actors, Richie (played by Finn Wolfhard) was my favourite and his jokes cracked the whole cinema up. Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is scary and really creeped me out, but for me there was just something missing about his character and I think he wasn't given enough dialogue.A minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed, in terms with the development of Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs), but for an adaption from a book, they managed to condense the original material very well.Overall, it (no pun intended) was a great thriller film that kept me on the edge of my seat, with strong performances.\",\n",
       "  'Dare I say it, the cheesy 1990 mini-series is far superior. Despite the hype, this adaptation was a real letdown. The kids were great, however the the CGI was awful and the jump scares were cheap.Bill Skarsgard? Hard to tell between him and the CGI.This adaptation was lacking in both exposition and soul. All we have here is a CGI clown terrorising some kids. There is no depth to the story of his origins. There is no proper backstory regarding the kids.There is absolutely none of the feeling of dread that both the book and the original mini-series encapsulated. No atmosphere whatsoever.Its not a bad film, but highly lacking.',\n",

I believe there is to be a next installment covering the (now) grown ups. I\\'ll probably watch it - if I\\'ve nothing better to do. It\\'s simply not Steven King\\'s \"IT\\'. ALso,they appear to have recycled the CGI lady from \\' Mama\\' at one point : can\\'t find it now, but look out for it. \"Beep,beep, Richie\" appears once, so far as I can tell - a long way into the film. Against all odds, I looked forward to this. But it\\'s another turkey. Steven King tells great stories - why do the Hollywood mob insist on killing them? I truly think this was dreadful and not a patch on the original. I hope to goodness they don\\'t remake The Stand.\\'',\n",
       "  'What is this? Horror for kids? This movie convinces me that the world has gone mad. This is entertainment for what age groups exactly? If its for adults, why is there so much childish humour and dialogue appealing to the sensibilities of an age group that should not be watching this level of blood, guts and graphic murder? The story line is directed towards a certain mentality, which is not of appeal to adults, at least not mature adults. Why on earth is this so popular? It failed to scare me on so many levels that I found myself imagining better scenes. How is it acceptable that kids of 12 years old were in the audience, looking at images of even younger children in the movie having their arm torn from their body, a man with a knife right in his throat? What the hell?! As soon as it was revealed that all the horrors were their imaginations, it was a pointless exercise. What happened to all the kids that were floating down at the end? Where was the main characters brother at the end? Wait for the next episode? No thanks. I would have enjoyed a psychological horror, but gore is not what I was expecting. Shows a lack of imagination by the director that he had to resort to this level of candy coated perversity. What a shame.',\n",

I feel insulted by the directors. It wasn\\'t scary at all. Any potential \"scary\" scene was downplayed by jokes so forcefully inserted into the script. There are multiple, major holes in the story line as well. Hole 1: the group of bullies never once said anything about their buddy missing.Hole 2: the girl is pulled down from \"floating\" and brought back to life. Doesn\\'t that mean that the hundreds of kids that come down from floating at the end come back to life too? Or do their rotting corpses fill up the sewers for 27 years? Does Georgie come back to life too?Hole 3: the girl can\\'t decide which boy she loves. She took the poem from the pudgy kids room (I have to assume because she randomly ends up with it in her bedroom) but then she thinks that Bill wrote the poem somehow. The pudgy kid kisses her, bringing her back to life (true love brings back the dead girl like Princess & the Frog or something) but she winds up with Bill.

       "  '*Spoliers*Honestly I was really excited about this movie, like really excited. I watched the original IT this morning to get ready for it and have some reference. And it was absolutely terrible. Seriously, TERRIBLE. Not only did I want to walk out the second Pennywise was shown in the beginning but the rest was torture. I was with other people so I couldn\\'t walk out. Here\\'s the thing, this is the first time I\\'ve ever been so disappointed with a movie that I went out of my way to write a review about it. The clown was not scary in the slightest. The teeth were stupid. The acting was a joke. The kids made a ton of terrible and sexual jokes. It didn\\'t stick to the original movie whatsoever. They took the \"you\\'ll float too\" a little too seriously. It just plain sucked. In the original, the kids were innocent and actually dorks but this was pathetic the way the kids were talking. And why the hell did we watch them in their underwear?!? I still keep wondering how the hell this movie is rated above an 8 when it should be a disappointment for anyone who knows what a good movie is. This was so much CGI that it took away from the whole movie. I could keep going but I think I\\'ve made my point. I wouldn\\'t waste your time or money. Watch the trailer and that\\'s as good as it gets. Ugh.',\n",
       "  'I\\'ll start this review by addressing that I had no expectation for the movie. I am not a fan of the horror genre as it usually lacks the thought provoking aspects I look forward to in film, but the reviews were great and I thought I\\'d give it a shot.The films antagonist is a demon-clown, who can shape-shift and move through space in an instant as demonstrated during the film. IT abducts, kills and eats children, but can only do so if they are experiencing fear. In the finale fight scene of the movie Pennywise is unable to kill and eat Beverly because she is not afraid of IT but at the start of the movie he kills Georgie after having a 5 minutes conversation with him where they laugh and mingle, Georgie even reaches towards IT to grab his boat - Would he really be so scared of IT at that point or was Beverly so not scared of an actual demon holding her up by the neck?The films plot surrounds around a bunch of disasters that the kids find out seem to happen every 27 years. this information is found out by a 13 year old kid named Ben, and he figured this out by reading some articles in a library. So this entire town of people has not been able to figure this out? And he informs the rest of the gang that in Derry there are substantially more children going missing than anywhere else in the US - If that is the case who is doing the abducting of children when Pennywise is on ITs break?All of the disasters have happened near sewage drains, that\\'s how the kids are able to figure out where IT lives, but at one point of the movie how was Pennywise able to appear in places that have no actual relation to the sewage? Pennywise appears and disappears in Bills garage and basement, Beverlys bathroom, in a building where Mikes parents died and in Stanleys dads office. If IT can appear anywhere why does he choose to murder and abduct near the drain if ITs only purpose is to feed upon the children as demonstrated in the final act of the film, he is willing to make a deal with the gang to keep Bill and let the rest of the children go as after eating Bill he would start his 27 year break again. Why would a killer demon clown not be willing to let these kids go anyways and just hunt the other kids in town to feed as these kids are obviously trying to kill him?Pennywise seems to have unfathomable power as in a scene IT is using hair from Beverlys sink to grab and pull her but in the final scene IT is having a fist fight with a bunch of children, couldn\\'t IT control some sort of object found in the sewer instead to do the same? Why is IT choosing to not use ITs full power against people who are fighting back but use such powerful methods when just trying to scare somebody?The movie is riddled with cliche\\'s about the bully having a really strict father, the plot point that the only way they can defeat the evil all-powerful shape-shifting demigod of a clown is to stick together and get over their fears! and of course the scene where the boys find Beverly levitating in mid-air while she is in a complete state of trance - a coma, and what brings her out of this is a kiss on the lips from one of the boys. before the movie ends Beverly is talking about this moment saying \"It was like being dead\" but when she comes out of her coma she without taking a breath starts quoting the poem one of the boys had sent her.The movie takes place during the three months of summer and ends with the start of September where the kids still look bruised and battered from their fight. So it\\'s safe to assume it must have been like a week since it happened. What were the kids doing the rest of the summer as they started seeing the clown as soon as school was out? Were they just having terrifying hallucinations of a killer clown and then enjoying the rest of their summer at the beach before going out and hunting it down? The times-pan of events in the movie don\\'t seem to reflect the time it actually took to accomplish them.This is the first time I have ever considered walking out of the cinema during a movie.',\n",
       "  \"Nothing. This was a staggeringly ham-fisted approach to either King's novel or the miniseries based on it. It missed the point utterly... You will not see a group of children whose shared bond enables them to overcome a monster. You will see a load of bickering kids who seem to barely tolerate each other come together briefly to rescue the kidnapped object of their pre-teen lust. You will not see an intelligently-written story. You will see a dumbed-down, by-the-numbers screenplay, complete with the usual beats, Crisis of Faith, Catharsis, and all. You will not see belief overpowering evil. You will see a ten-minute fight scene where every kid tries to out-cool every other kid and get off a Schwarzeneggerian one-liner.This movie is garbage. I can't express it more eloquently than that.\",\n",

Creepy, disturbing, humorous, IT really possess the creep factor, giving audiences a new reason to fear clowns. The entire casting choices were sensational. All actors really held their own, creating a sense of comradery between the characters. Like most people, I do hold the miniseries with Tim Curry close to my heart, but after seeing this adaptation, I was beyond pleasantly surprised. So much so that upon IT being released into cinemas, I'll be back in line to see it again.\",\n",

Many times the kids in this movie try to be funny  but come off really stupid instead.  The scene where the two groups of kids are throwing rocks at each other  and the movie is playing some rock music is so cringy. What the Hell  was the point of that scene? Ridiculous.  And what was up with that zombie homeless looking dude? That zombie guy  talks like a death metal singer and I felt like I was watching The  Walking Dead.  I did not give a fat fvck about ANY of the kids in this movie. I was  not interested nor was I rooting for the kids. There was nothing  special about any of the kid characters. NONE of the kids of the  \"Losers Club\" gets killed in this film. All that tension and none of  the kids get killed. Not one.

Someone described the movie as 'The Goonies' meets 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' - this turned out to be an extremely accurate description!The opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark, yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercut by comedy. This happens repeatedly throughout the film: and it works. My friends and I (as well as the entire packed cinema) found ourselves gasping at scenes of sheer terror, then only moments later laughing hysterically at the banter between the main characters.I would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart, yet I think even those individuals would find themselves enjoying 'It'. If not for the horror, then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie. It's as if this is a movie within a movie: a mix of a high-school-problems/coming-of-age movie and a horror. A brilliant two-for-one if you ask me!Great acting from all of the cast as well as excellent writing make this movie a must watch!\",\n",

The tea-cup ride at your local fair ground will give you more of a thrill.Talk about the cliché central. A slow, plot holed, far fetched, continuity riddled farce. CGI was cheap and out of place. This is NOT a horror, or even a b-movie horror. This is more akin to a comedy at best. Of course you'll get the odd 'jump factor' thrown in for good measure - even these are predictable and poorly scripted. Sad to say, Scary Movie would deserve an Oscar pitted against this mess.The only saving grace was the make-up department did a great job and the acting wasn't completely off.The hype surrounding this film was very well done - I congratulate the marketing and PR companies spin for a complete piece of trash.

       "  \"I had high hopes for this movie. In fact, you could say this was one of the most anticipated movies of my lifetime. I was psychologically tormented by Tim Curry at the age of 10, and it took several years to get over the weekly nightmares. Although aspects of the trailers made me concerned this was going to turn into a jump scare film that you stop taking seriously by the midpoint, the overwhelmingly positive reviews that were coming out after the initial screenings had me optimistic and excited to be the first one telling everyone to go see it. Unfortunately, I can't do that after seeing IT.The first 10 minutes of the film were perfect. Ultimately what I was most looking forward to from IT was a new take on Pennywise. I wanted to see what a different actor could do with him, particularly his ability to be psychologically creepy and disturbing. And I felt like I got that in the first scene, and that was pretty much it. After the Georgie scene it seemed like anything Skarsgård did was masked by CGI, overblown audio, and distracting cinematography in 80-90% of his remaining screen time. What's sad is I think the mainstream audience will still eat this style up. The same people who will call this Pennywise scarier than the last are the people who said the Star Wars prequels were better because they had more LIGHT SABERS in them. OK.Sure, I enjoyed the crude Richie and Eddie humor, and thought it was well-cast for the most part. But by the end I was almost yawning through the Pennywise scenes. I just got out of the film and am alone in a dark basement right now and am not scared in the slightest. There is something wrong with that.\",\n",

In an attempt to make a more visually stimulating remake of the classic It, this movie ending up looking more like a Salvador Dali painting, if Dali were extremely tacky. The fear factor was taken out and replaced with jump scares and unnecessary gore. And I LOVE gore. Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise seemed more like a mentally incapacitated pedophile than an embodiment of fear. The only salvageable parts of this movie were due to the outstanding child actors and Finn Wolfhard's admittedly immature, yet hilarious wise cracks. I had hoped that because of this the relationship between the 7 friends would be properly represented, however, the introduction of certain characters and their back stories were extremely rushed or completely skipped over despite the fact that this movie was about 2.5 hours long and focused only on the childhood of the It characters. The only new thing introduced to this movie, that was actually worth watching was the scene with Bill and Georgie near the end. It might be a fun movie to watch with your friends and laugh at, but don't pay money to watch it.\"],\n",
       " ['It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve read the book or seen the first movie; so I apologize if I get some things wrong.TLDR; The film drags on in the middle by splitting up the crew and subjecting them to meaningless jump scares. This means little character interaction (which is part of what the first movie had going for it). By the time you get to the final confrontation with Pennywise, you\\'re just tired of the jump scares and want it to be over because you\\'re not really rooting for the losers. And if you are, it\\'s mostly because of what was established in the first film.Pros:\\nThe film starts off great. Somehow the scene at the bridge manages to match the iconic opening scene of the first.Skarsgård is an amazing Pennywise and is creepy as hell.Stan\\'s speech in Richie\\'s second flashback is great and actually funny.Casting is, for the most part, really good. I think it was hard for some of the adult actors to find a balance between being recognizable while still showing how they\\'ve matured over time. Adult Richie is too kid-like while Bev is too mature to the point of being unrecognizable.Cons:\\nBowers is half-assed. Literally just used for three jump scares and nothing else. Either imply that he died and leave him out or fully use him like he is in the book as the epitome of the corruption in Derry.The final form of Pennywise is unsatisfying. It\\'s literally a clown torso on some sort of arachnid body. They needed to go full arachnid alien like it is in the book. I think this part is just difficult to translate from the book though.Stan\\'s letter at the end cheapens his death. Instead of him literally being unable to handle his fear of IT, his suicide is portrayed as a sacrifice to save the others.There\\'s next to no character development and very little meaningful interaction between characters. I blame this mostly on the middle 90 minutes where they all split up. It\\'s totally different from the first film where they are actually a team.Speaking of which, this part where they all go their separate ways to find their \"tokens\" is so contrived. The story literally loses all its steam due to this and makes it feel way too long.All of the monster scenes except the ones with Pennywise have terrible CGI. They might be gross and/or startling but you can see them coming and they don\\'t contribute much.About 1/3 to 1/2 of the jokes just kinda fell flat.The constant jump scenes and long running time just make this movie exhausting to watch. It was just a constant cycle of \"pan to character, give a little backstory, jump scare, repeat\".',\n",

As a huge fan of the original mini-series (and EVERYTHING Tim Curry), I knew I'd have a challenge going into both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 with an open mind. I had to separate. I didn't have as high of expectations as I did for Chapter 1 as Part 2 of the mini series was much weaker than the Part 1 anyway as well as Stephen King's It (Book).The actors were great. Even the first few jump scares were decent, and then it just became overkill. And not scary whatsoever. All of the CGI monsters look ridiculous and completely take you out of the moment. I grew up watching 80s/90s horror (AND LOVING IT). The baddies were REAL and TERRIFYING. For example, Mrs. Massey, the bloated bathtub corpse in The Shining. That was a real, completely horrifying image that has stayed with me 30 years after I First saw the movie. I don't understand the obsession with CGI when there's no need for it.Sadly, this movie was just a drawn out bore.\",\n",

Should you be allowed to leave reviews if your taste in movies is that bad?! Some poor sod might read your review and go see this movie...do you not feel any guilt!This was AWFUL! Its not even worth constructing proper sentences for so I'll leave these points here:1. The terrible acting. It was awful. The actors were either bored or overacting (Bill, Mike, Richie). Seriously terrible.2. What on earth was the need to make this a 3 hour movie?! It was so unnecessarily dragged out and incredibly boring3. The story had no story. Mike tells them there's an Indian ritual they must collect artefacts for which separates them all for 2 hours of the movie but then it turns out there was no ritual...WHAT?! What was the point of that?! Ben threw into the fire something he'd held dear in his wallet for 27 years for...no.....reason??4. Seperating the characters like that and filling the scenes with flashbacks made sure there was no character development5. Erm what happened to Bills wife? Bev is kissing all the guys but is still married. They turned Bev's character into a gold digging floozy by having her kiss Bill then choose the wealthy and better looking Ben for his boat?!6. What in the name of all that is Mike Myers was that terrible CGI about?! The old granny scene in the original was scary as she was a creepy old lady not a 15 foot naked zombie like monster7. Speaking of zombies...Bowers zombie friend drives cars and breaks him out of an asylum? If zombies can do that, why did Pennywise need Bowers?8. Speaking of Bowers...what was the point of him in all his over acting melodrama? He did nothing. Except to prove you can be stabbed in the heart and walk away absolutely fine9. Stanley's suicide notes to each and every one of them that he wrote and posted before killing himself?! The act was supposed to have been done out of pure fear...not as a human sacrifice10. The grand finale. After spending 2 hours looking for tokens and Mike carrying around a badly built dustbin made in a beginner's pottery class, turns out all you had to do was hurt Pennywises feelings by calling him a clown and he will turn into a baby?

If there is a category for Best Casting Director in the Academy Award, I am all in to bet that It: Chapter Two\\'s will not just get nominated, but win very big. The casting director deserves a standing ovation for choosing the right actors for the right characters that resemble a lot with the younger-selves from the predecessor.You will feel the emotional impact of The Losers\\' Club as a whole. The fear that feeds their souls, the memories that hunt them & the hopeless feeling that manipulates their strength all leave a strong impression to wonder within & about.The various & disparate forms of IT should give a blast of excitement to the audience. This is the most entertaining part of the movie where you get to watch new other-worldly creatures lingering within the shadows or the old monsters are back to haunt them with a peek-a-boo! It is gross, weird and definitely strange.The heartwarming story of The Losers\\' Club friendship is the beautiful gem you will find in no other horror movies this year. The connection they have is so strong and palpable,An excellent set of transition techniques that jump from one place to another, giving that ominous vibe and at the same time feels like an adventure.Cons:Albeit the creatures are entertaining to watch, however it lacks the manifestation of the scary rituals that should follow. This is the main problem with the IT movies, it is not terrifying nor scary enough to make you have a nightmare. Even sometimes it is laughable due to its unprecedented nature of the creatures\\' features.The real form of IT is upsetting and disappointing. I can strongly say that the majority will love IT\\'s true form from the 1990 Television Mini-Series in comparison to the remake because that looks scarier, deadlier & more realistic.It is super slow and draggy that it doesn\\'t need to be at almost 3 hours mark. 2 hours should be the best run time for this movie like IT Chapter One. It has nothing much to talk about especially during the first hour. Reunion, get together, a few jumpscare parts. That\\'s all there is to it.The second act of the movie (halfway) feels as if you are watching 5 to 6 different short films instead. Because it has that slow-burning nature, the scenes feel disjointed from one another. It spends around 45 minutes to an hour to look at every members of The Losers\\' Club being haunted by Pennywise.Verdict: IT CHAPTER TWO is certainly fresh and enjoyable. Hopes up not, its extremely slow-going story may make the audience bore enough to put you into sleep mode. IT CHAPTER TWO walks you into a journey of the insidious Derry town albeit its lack of formidable creatures.',\n",

It was super long but that isn't even what upset me. It was just lacking in delivery! Pennywise was hardly in the movie. He was in it but they spent so much time soul searching the past of the characters that the real present stuff went lacking. Needless to say the first remake is an all time favorite. This one, I definitely should've waited until it came out on DVD. Just being honest. The first one was way to good for this to be part 2.

It is not scary, just very, very annoying and does not live up to either the book, the mini-tv series or part 1 of the reboot from 2017 (even though it also was an CGI orgy).If you like a horror movie, where you don\\'t need a build of tension or the director sticking to a plot or giving the audience a decent payout, but just adds a lot of jumpscares for almost 3 hours - You will love this..\\nBut hey, it\\'s just my opinion..',\n",
       "  \"Returning to their home-town, the now-adult group of friends finds they've been gathered to fulfill the childhood promise that the killer clown Pennywise has returned and is on the loose in the town, forcing them to put aside their past traumas to defeat the malevolent being once and for all.This was a woefully underwhelming and overblown effort. Among its many flaws is the most obvious issue in that there's just no reason for the running time to last this long at all. So much of this one could've been cut down or outright removed, from the introduction of the gang one-by-one to see where their lives are like now that goes into plenty of detail that could've been accomplished easier, to the incidents in the asylum tormenting the residents inside or just the seemingly endless scenes depicting the escaped inmate under the clown's influence. That these are done in conjunction with utterly boring flashbacks and storytelling that shows how they used to be as kids that just go on forever, serve no purpose to the storyline at all and just seem to focus on seemingly random incidents that just plain dull to get through. It highlights the fact that the main clown does absolutely nothing here with so little screen-time as we're focusing on the kids' flashbacks interacting with the clown or building the romance angle instead of in modern times. The other factor to lower this one are the entirely overblown scare attempts that fall completely flat. The CGI here manages to undo so much of the attempts that the scenes of the food coming to life in the Chinese restaurant is laughably inept with the black pool looking like a deformed blob-like mess that's incredibly cheesy looking and makes no sense in the storyline how that works, much less comes off like any other expected outcome from the very start. Likewise, flashbacks to show the kids interacting with Pennywise, featuring the confrontation in the apartment, the statue coming to life in the park or the appearance from the sewer grate are all laughably bad and underwhelming with how crude they are. It's pretty disheartening to see so much wasted time in a film this long feature so little chances for something to happen and then showcase such underwhelming and laughably bad work when they do appear, really undermining this one and making for a troublesome effort. There are only a few select aspects that work here. Despite generally being underwhelming, the encounter with the kid in the hall-of-mirrors at the carnival stands out as a wholly enjoyable and solid enough effort that works off the darkness of the setting, the overall creepiness of the concept in general and stellar practical effects that are usually missing from these other scenes. As well, the spirit of unity and brotherhood that they display in the finale when they band together to take on the true form of the creature in the underground sewer lair of Pennywise which is not only a great idea to see play out but has some energetic albeit comically over-the-top action that at least puts some life into things. Combined with the creepiness of the main clown and the ability to kill off kids with graphic results, these are all that work for this one.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, underage smoking and continuous violence against children.\",\n",
       "  'I personally didn\\'t enjoy IT 2017 so I didn\\'t have much hope for part 2 but I was expecting them to at least tone down the CGI instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy CGI effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more Stephen King books are going to get remakes and it won\\'t be long before we get an all CGI Maximum Overdrive movie remake.There are more scenes with Pennywise transforming and creating twisted ways to mess with the returning losers club members but sadly they are all done with CGI and are all standard copy and paste scenes from the original mini series and when the movie finally gets to it\\'s climax the makers of this \"Horror Movie\" think by simply making Pennywise bigger it instills more fear into the audience when really all it does is scream CGI and all the suspence is watered down to bigger pixels on screen than there where before \"Terrifying\"The only and I do mean only saving grace this movie has is the cast they all do a great job on screen especially considering they have to pretend to be scared and flee in terror from a green screen it\\'s not the actors fault this movie was a big let down.I recommend watching the original IT mini series if you haven\\'t already seen it Tim Curry\\'s performance as Pennywise is the reason why people who grew up in the 90s have a fear of clowns because a great actor in the right role can make all the difference in a movie Tim Curry will always be Pennywise no matter how many remakes are made just like Judy Garland will always be Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ there performance makes the movie so memorable and it can\\'t be re-created no matter how much CGI you use.',\n",
       "  \"After seeing Chapter One I expected so much more, unfortunately IT didn't deliver. The film starts out with an overly graphic bashing scene that tries hard to be topical but instead seems to be there just to dare you to criticize it's honesty. And things just go downhill from there. The Loser's Club of the first film reunites 27 years later to have another go at defeating Pennywise, but where the kids were charming and you wanted to root for them, the adults all go separate ways to have their own jump scene moments through an overly long two hour middle section of the film. The film bogs because it keeps showing flashbacks to when they were kids instead of building the characters as adults. The effect is that you never really care about them as adults, they're just an excuse to show CGI monsters that never really scare you on any level. The pacing of the film is so roughshod that it never lets any suspense build as it jumps from one scene to the next, while you keep checking your watch wondering how much more of this you'll have to endure. The middle becomes a bit of a horror film mish mash with an homage to John Carpenter's The Thing (verbatim quote and all) a little bit of Toy Story erector spider, a dash of Poltergeist's Native American mumbo jumbo added in with a couple of million years old space entity tossed in in case you needed something to understand what they're up against. James McAvoy's character is jokingly referred to as an author whose book endings suck (a nod to the book) and unfortunately this film doesn't improve on the novel. It's just an overly long series of vignettes that tie to Chapter One in an unsatisfying way.\",\n",
       "  \"'IT chapter 2' is a film based on the Steven King's novels, that was released on screen in order to express the horror that the evil clown exposed in the old town of Derry. The direction is poor, seems like they didn't even try to make it scary or post the image that this story was supposed to show. I remember a scene in the theater where I would laugh to those small babyheaded spiders. The cast looked like they were bored every minute of it, being there just for the title of the film and the publicity it had gained. They did not make any try to act, just reading words and acting accordingly like anybody could do it. The story had some interest but it was all sunk with the terrible acting and directing and at some point took the downroad for good as it seemed like they made it something up to fill it up as they were running out of time. There were many points during the film where I was annoyed, even bored, ready to sleep on my chair, the duration of the film was inexcusable like there were added extra nonsense minutes to it. To sum it up, 'IT chapter 2' is a movie for young kids aged 10 - 14 because they would be the only ones to appreciate it. I would not recommend it for anyone over that age plus I would not pay to watch it again. It was a really bad try, I would add, pathetic at least.\",\n",

To director Andy Muschietti you should put more scenes about the clown, because i seen the scenes is just little bit. That is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortain. This is not horror film. Terrifying, it is not. Scary it is not. There is nothing scary about this movie. There was so much wasted potential here.

Anyone who is familiar with the \\'It\\' book or original mini-series will know the ending was not well liked. Here now though they had a chance to rectify things, and I can assure you they did. Not just in terms of the ending, but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one.The film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours. The thing is though I can\\'t see it having the same impact if it were much shorter. There was a lot of layers to fit in. This isn\\'t your average \"fast-food\" horror like the \\'Conjuring\\' universe films. This is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror. The first half of the film especially. A long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters, showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again. Then in the second half of the film (and yes I\\'m talking about almost an entire 90 minutes) the film kicks into hyper-drive with non-stop, in your face horror - and it is a sight to behold.The cast were again all perfectly selected. Bill Hader in particular steals the show. He is given some great one-liners to work with, much the same as Finn Wolfhard was, and he nails every one of them. There is also a great Stephen King cameo. This isn\\'t just a case of blink and you\\'ll miss him, he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue. I wasn\\'t sure whether \\'It Chapter Two\\' would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves, but it certainly did.

They were just that: characters.I was pleasantly surprised the movie opened with the Adrian Melon scene. This scene is one that makes the story of IT (and many other stories of mr. King) so great: besides the obvious evil of Pennywise, there are also \"real\" threats, like homophobic villagers.I was very disappointed in the fact the storyline of Beverly\\'s husband was completely cut, and the storyline of Henry Bowers was butchered. The fact that the Losers weren\\'t only fighting Pennywise, but also had to dodge attacks from real people (so more rational fears if you will) was what made the book and the mini-series better than this flick.All in all, it was an \"okay\" movie.

Lots of jumpscares, all so predictable, I was so bored, I thought: oh please, not another one. And why do they always feel the need to change the plot? For instance the one about Bill not being really sick? Why do filmmakers think they know it better than Stephen King? Or steal from other movies (the Thing) And the end, the end, that was the last straw for me. If you read the book you know what IT really looks like. I was sooo hoping for a fantastic monster (they used enough CGI, didn't they) maybe a little like the Queen in Alien?(the one in the miniseries made me laugh). But no, what a mess.

Unfortunately, this one was a huge mess.I love the way the first IT didn't want to be JUST a horror movie, but rather took time to build up a story, emotional connection. That is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays. HOWEVER, this was completely thrown out the window in the second one. Considering how incredibly long this movie is, 90% of it was just buildup for jumpscares, jumpscares themselves and weird CGI.The worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on, jumping all over the place. And most of it was just for shock value, nothing important to the story.What I did love was the casting, it was absolutely brilliant, especially Eddie.I guess this is once again a classic case of - bigger budget does not mean better movie, as well as more CGI does not mean better movie.\",\n",
       "  'Look, I don\\'t mind being entertained at the movies, but there does come the expectation with such an adaptation of one of the best and most beloved horror novels ever written that it accord some respect while remaining true to the source material.My main problem with this film lies in its tonal inconsistency. I could never tell if it was attempting to set a somber, foreboding, menacing feeling, or if it was trying to create an atmosphere conducive towards a lighthearted, hilarious jump-scare filled marathon. In one moment it hangs heavy in emotional gravitas (the opening scene is especially brutal and difficult to watch, and Stanley\\'s suicide is also fairly dark), and the next, it\\'s so ludicrously over the top and in your face in its execution of its \"horror\" elements that it produces a jarring sense of tonal discord. What exactly is this film attempting to be? The horror was so absurdly explicitly comedic in its execution (not helped by questionable effects work) that I must assume that was the intent. Yet in taking such a directorial approach, it effectively nullified the entire foundation that the movie required to establish and help foment the dreadful tension, atmosphere, and tone necessitated by the narrative (and of which made the book so stellar), and further relegated all the work by the actors and all other aspects of the film that had helped establish it up to that point void. If it wasn\\'t intentional, then it does nothing so well as to exemplify how the filmmakers hold a fundamental misunderstanding of what actual horror really entails.\"IT Chapter Two\" spends much of its runtime plodding through a mindless, rote, predictable checklist of the characters recovering their artifacts from their youths, to the same tired, mindless, rote, predictable jump scares thrown at you one after the other which you can see coming from a million miles off which further robbed them of all their potency. How am I supposed to care at all about the protagonists\\' emotional plights (which are portrayed in a serious light) when their antagonist and its supposedly evil forms who are responsible for them are utterly stripped of their malevolence and are portrayed in such a formulaic, repetitive, explicit, and laughably juvenile manner? Yes, I know \"IT\" manifests itself also as a Pennywise who does utilize a childlike humor to lure his prey in, but that doesn\\'t mean it wasn\\'t the only way nor that the entity wasn\\'t terrifying in all the revelations of its truest forms. They were terrifying in the novel, and here they\\'re a downright riot. A little subtlety, suggestion, imagination, minimalism and unpredictability goes a long way and would\\'ve done this film wonders, as that\\'s where the real core of any effective horror resides. It would\\'ve not only have helped maintain tonal consistency, it would\\'ve made it genuinely unsettling. My theatre was howling at every turn, and I\\'m completely left at a loss as to whether that was what the director intended.As is, this film suffers an identity crisis. It is inconsistent, predictable, ludicrously (and unintentionally?) hilarious, redundant, overly drawn out to the point of boredom, and worst of all, a downright insult to King, who I\\'m shocked made the cameo he did in tacit approval of this screen adaptation abomination of his finest work. The glaring tonal juxtaposition and abysmal execution robbed me of all interest in witnessing The Losers\\' Club finally confront this ultimate evil terrorizing a small Maine town every 27 years, because in the end, it wasn\\'t an ultimate evil at all......it was a goddamn mockery of one.And due to that, I walked out. Truly, truly awful.',\n",
       "  'In 1913, Henry Ford introduced the assembly line to the Ford Motor Company. He made a ton of money and was hailed as a leading innovator. Now just a hundred years later, director Andy Musciehtti brings that same assembly line principle to It Chapter Two as he serves up his scary products in the exact fashion as the one before.This sequel to the highest-grossing horror movie of all time (unadjusted) takes place 27 years later in the same town of Derry, Maine. The rambunctious kids are all adults now and have gone on their separate paths to some form of success. Unfortunately, the good fortune for each is put to an end by the return of Pennywise, who seeks more victims for his twisted games. Being the only ones that have stopped the evil force, the adults must come together again to put an end to this bloody mess.Director Andy Muschietti returns behind the camera after the record-breaking success he earned from 2017\\'s \"It\". For the second time around, Muschietti goes even bigger and bolder than before, both in terms of the horror set pieces and the length.When it comes to giving audiences what they came to see, Muschietti delivers on adding even more blood, gore, and creepiness. Pennywise\\'s indescribable powers get even more creative as his prey are stalked and slaughtered with unnerving brutality.The biggest fault that plagued the previous film was its recycling of cheap jump scares that were meant to artificially hold your attention. That same problem is even more glaring in the sequel as any scary moments are just startling moments where something pops out at the screen. The more they happen, the more predictable and boring they are to watch.A runtime is never indicative of quality by itself, every movie should earn its length through skill and craftsmanship. And at 170 minutes, \"It Chapter Two\" falls way short of earning its record-breaking runtime. Instead of the horror being a slow burn, it\\'s more of a slow churn as the recycled jump scares quickly lose their minuscule luster and make this already long film feel even longer.Screenwriter Gary Dauberman takes up the impossible task of adapting Stephen King, a challenge that has killed the careers of countless adapters before him.Dauberman tries his best to break away from the ridiculousness within King\\'s novel, but his efforts end up backfiring on him and make the film even more awkward as some elements are left in and some left out. The story wants you to take it pretty seriously, but keeping in the weird elements make that almost an impossible task.Muschietti didn\\'t do much to justify the excessive length, but Dauberman should shoulder more of the blame with his uneven pacing. The film starts great with the together and playing off each other with a fun and brisk pace. Then, against all logic, Dauberman has them split up for ninety minutes, severely slowing things to a crawl and forcing the jump scares to keep you awake.The highest regards should go to casting director Rich Delia as he has brilliantly put together a group of adult actors that uncannily look like their younger counterparts. Unfortunately, good looks are the only quality some actors possess here.James McAvoy does fine as Bill. The most evident acting trait he shows off is his struggle to hide his Scottish accent with a less than convincing New England one.Having a rocky 2019, to say the least, Jessica Chastain follows up the bomb that was \"Dark Phoenix\" with another subpar performance. She doesn\\'t shine as brightly as Sophia Lillis\\' younger Beverly despite being the more acclaimed actress with a lot more screen time.The standout performances come from the two Bills in the cast, Hader and Skarsgård. Hader plays adult Richie and fairs the best in the cast at toeing the line between drama and comedy.Skarsgård as Pennywise is a sight to see but unfortunately doesn\\'t get seen for long stretches. Between him and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker, future performances for clowns now have an insanely high bar to reach.With over five hours of material between two films, the \"It\" series has come to a less than satisfying close with \"It Chapter Two\". There are some things to admire Muschietti and co. for doing or trying to do. But for every great Bill Skarsgård moment (which is all of them), there were just as many moments of wasted potential due to unoriginal filmmaking. Overall, between its highs and lows, \"It Chapter Two\" makes for a semi-enjoyable time. Just make sure to bring a seat cushion.'],\n",
       " [\"Camille, who was drunk almost every hour of the day from the moment she arrived in town, tries to repress the traumas she has experienced but she is not very successful in that regard. We understand with instant flashback scenes how emotions that Camille suppressed suddenly surfaced and she can't cope with her past. The town's suc-cessful drowning atmosphere, combined with masterful work of fiction and image management and with the convincing performance of Amy Adams, turns the series into a complete mood, so to speak. With the hypnotizing music that plays in the background while watching to the series we seem to be drunk in the Wind Gap with Camille. There are great soundtracks from Led Zeppelin to The Doors, from Bob Dylan to Johnny Cash.The scene transitions between past memories and the present are very successful. It's like the scenes are intertwined. You're not leaving the general story of the series as you watch the past memories scenes. It's very well tuned. We see that the series doesn't go on a straight timeline. The scene at the beginning of the episodes is actually the final scene. Although not in each episode, some episodes have these time shifts.In the background of the series, the words shown for 3-4 seconds may give hints about the series. At least when you watch it carefully, it makes you think. Who knows, maybe a subliminal message. You're unlikely to guess who the killer is. Because in each section you focus on different people. Ideas may change as new details emerge. So it's a little hard to guess. Something I like about this series. Because an unpredictable series is more attractive to me.I found the acting very good. I think Amy Adams deserves the Golden Globe award with this performance. She conveys her character's mood very well to the audience. You feel deeply the feelings of Camille. Amy Adams and Patricia Clarkson are really good. I found the tension between them very good. Unfortunately, it is not possible to escape from the parents we are attached to. Camille also lives this situation deeply. I guess one of the most complicated things in life is the child-parent relationship. Eliza Scanlen who plays the character Amma is very successful. Like two separate characters in the morning and night. It's like there's someone else in Amma when it's night. Of course it is necessary to open a separate parentheses to Sophia Lillis. She performed very well.Although the first episode starts with a slow pace, the next episodes are moving well. And it reflects thriller very well. The entire town, including the police, seems to be looking for the killer from a single perspective. It's like the killer is the whole town. I love watching horror movies but I can't say I'm scared most of the time. But in this series, there were a lot of scenes that creeped and disturbed me.In the series the mystery of the killer is preserved until the last moment, but in the final, the series shoots the audience in the heart with a single sentences. The series manages to leave a shocking effect on viewers with its final. Sharp Objects gave the message that it wanted to give in eight episodes. I can recommend it for those who love the psychological thriller and killer themed. 9/10\",\n",

It is also incredibly well acted. The \"slow burn\" pace is a dramatic marinade, allowing us to really soak in the character and absorb the experience.

I\\'ll get to the end of episode 3 or 4 and start to feel frustrated because nothing much has happened since the 1st episode. I\\'ll check the episode list and groan that a good story is being stretched across 8-10 episodes. However I\\'m hooked, I need to know what happens, so I continue to watch. But I respectfully request that they be told more concisely. My family has developed a game of sorts to each give our opinion as to how many episodes the story could have actually been told in and inevitably, it is at least half. Sharp Objects is one of these shows that could have been told in half the episodes. Easily. The acting was superb, the story interesting, but the pace was slower than a Sunday afternoon. These are good shows, i.e., Goliath (2nd season), The Sinner, The OA, Mindhunter, Lost in Space, and now Sharp Objects, just to name a few. They are worth watching, but I find them frustrating for plot points to be piecemealed out over so many hours. I\\'m not asking the stories be told like the fast-talking legal disclaimers at the end of an AM radio ad, but just be tightened up a bit.Take the first season of Stranger Things, for instance. It was like an 8 hour movie where each episode advanced the story line at a very satisfying pace. I couldn\\'t stop watching and gobbled it all up in one day. (I LOVE when all the episodes drop at once!) The first and second season of Bosch were like this as well. Bingeing at its best. Now I know this is my opinion and others will disagree with me, but it is a trend I have noticed over the past couple of years and maybe there are others out there who have noticed it too. This is my little two cents worth.I find it strange to ask for less of a good thing, but that\\'s what I\\'m asking. I want to watch shows that make me put down my laptop and phone, to make me stop playing games or surf the internet while the show is on. I wanna have to pause to discuss what just happened and look forward to watching more. Instead, my reaction to last night\\'s Sharp Objects was \"yay, it\\'s the last episode and we can finally get some answers\". The paint has finally dried!I sound ungrateful, I know.

Nothing wrong with that, of course; the first season of True Detective (2014) (still one of the finest seasons of TV ever made) worked as well as it did not because of the ostensible whodunnit, but because of the psychological deep-dive into its two central characters. Sharp Objects is similarly interested not in who\\'s behind a pair of murders in a small Missouri town, but in how those murders affect a trio of women caught up in the investigation. Feminine in design rather than inherently feminist, the show is a portrait of tainted motherhood and corrupted sisterhood, and focuses on internecine inter-generational conflict, matrilineal dysfunction, and how difficult it can be to escape from past trauma. But whilst the acting is exceptional, and the show is well directed and edited, much like the first season of Big Little Lies (2017), it left me wholly unengaged, completely uninterested in any of the characters, and fighting interminable boredom for much of its eight hours (it\\'s yet another example of one of the worst elements of Prestige TV; series which are far, far longer than they need to be).Sharp Objects tells the story of Camille Preaker (an exceptional Amy Adams), a reporter for the St. Louis Chronicle, who is sent back to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri to report on the murder of two young girls. A barely-functioning alcoholic prone to carving words into her flesh, Camille is ill-prepared for the effect Wind Gap has on her psyche. Central amongst her demons is her mother, Adora (a spectacular Patricia Clarkson), who looks down on Camille with barely-concealed disappointment. Camille is especially haunted by the memory of her younger sister Marian, who died when they were still children, but in the years since Camille moved away, Adora re-married and had another child, Amma (Eliza Scanlen, in a breakout role), who fascinates Camille with her dual personality - dutiful daughter from another era who wears elaborate dresses and plays with a doll\\'s house, and roller-blading lollypop sucking teenage temptress.Based on the 2006 Gillian Flynn novel, Sharp Objects was written primarily by showrunner Marti Noxon and Flynn herself, with directorial duties handled by Jean-Marc Vallée, who also helmed the aforementioned first season of Big Little Lies. Vallée was also lead editor, and this is important insofar as the editing is the show\\'s calling card, as he attempts to draw us into Camille\\'s psyche via fleeting snippets of childhood memories. The editing rhythms will definitely throw some people off initially, with the frequent one second (or less) cutaways recalling Oliver Stone\\'s \"horizontal editing\". However, a more apt comparison would be the free-associative editing style of films such as Hiroshima mon amour (1959), Zerkalo (1975), and probably the best evocation of memory ever put on screen, Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988). Indeed, the technique is not entirely unlike Marcel Proust\\'s use of \"involuntary memory\" in À la recherche du temps perdu - so, for example, adult Camille lies in bed and stares at a crack on the ceiling and when we cut back to the bed, she\\'s a child looking at that same crack; adult Camille is shown opening a door, and we cut to child Camille entering a room; adult Camille hears a song and closes her eyes, and when she opens them, she\\'s a child listening to the song on the radio.This editing style inculcates us into Camille\\'s fractured mind, whilst also hinting at the nature of her trauma, without ever being too explicitly revealing. As will be discussed in a moment, Vallée grossly overuses the technique, neutering it of its potency, but that notwithstanding, it\\'s a good example of the importance of \"show, don\\'t tell\", as well as a great example of content generating form and form simultaneously giving rise to content; the memories are always tied to Camille\\'s fragmented psychology, with the brief snippets of recollection acting like splinters impinging on her adult existence.Another interesting aesthetic aspect of the show is its sense of place. Taking place during a hot summer in which the entire cast are permanently sweating, one can practically feel the humidity rising from the screen and smell the pig farm on which so many of the town\\'s people work. But it\\'s not just the sense of tangibility; at times, Wind Gap comes across as surreal enough to be the location of a David Lynch film. The introduction to the town, for example, is a series of long tracking shots which show next-to-no people, as if the place has been abandoned. Later we see Amma and two of her friends perpetually roller-blading around town like the 21st century equivalent of the Moirai, we also meet a little boy who lives with his meth-addicted mother and who carries a gun to ensure their safety.Thematically, the show covers a lot of ground, almost all of it tied to female experience, specifically motherhood/daughterhood. Adora is a woefully bad mother who made little secret of the fact that she preferred Marian to Camille; when Camille arrives at the house upon her return to Wind Gap, rather than be happy to see her, Adora icily tells her, \"I\\'m afraid the house is not up to par for visitors\". In a rare moment of openness, as Camille struggles to understand why Adora treats her the way she does, Adora tells her, \"you can\\'t get close. That\\'s your father. And it\\'s why I think I never loved you. You were born to it, that cold nature. I hope that\\'s of some comfort to you\". Later she admits that what she wanted from Camille more than anything was the one thing Camille couldn\\'t give her - she wanted Camille to need her.In a more general sense, the show deals with how women respond to familial trauma. It doesn\\'t engage with feminism at a political or cultural level, but it certainly does so at a personal level, arguing that the pain experienced by abused women is just as valid as that experienced by abused men, that the manifestations of trauma can be just as catastrophic, and that the anger engendered can be just as self-destructive. We\\'re very used to seeing stories focused on angry, damaged, hard-drinking male characters with dark backgrounds who must fight to control the violence within them, but Sharp Objects is a story focused on the female equivalent of that trope. Indeed, Wind Gap is a town where women are locked into the virtuous virgin/rampant harlot binary, a binary created by men. It\\'s a place where a woman\\'s worth correlates directly with her femininity, her maternal instincts, and her obedient acceptance of her place in androcentric societal structures - everything Camille is not.However, for all that, I couldn\\'t get into Sharp Objects, and by no means did I enjoy it. The biggest problem is the pace. Yes, I understand it\\'s a character drama, not a plot-heavy murder-mystery, but so too was the first season of True Detective and never once did I feel that show was moving too slow. With Sharp Objects, as episode after episode after episode ended flatly, eventually I just stopped caring. Aside from a major incident in the first episode, and a couple of big reveals in the penultimate and last episodes, almost nothing happens. And that\\'s not hyperbole, I mean it very literally. Tied to this is that the show is far, far too long. The novel is 254 pages, and could easily have been adapted in a four-episode run, but trying to stretch it out over eight (it runs 385 minutes) means that there are long periods were the narrative stops dead, with the characters not interesting enough to take up the slack. Elsewhere, the flashback editing is used so often that it loses its potency and ends up feeling like filler designed only to artificially prolong the runtime. It also starts to feel like Vallée is so in love with the technique that he\\'s using it arbitrarily rather than in the service of character or plot. Additionally, the show abounds in clichés - from the alcoholic hard-as-nails journalist to the incompetent local police chief to the out of town detective to whom nobody listens to the gossiping women to the various suspects who are obviously red herrings. Vallée also has a tendency to overuse certain images, thus robbing them of their effectiveness - Amma and her friends roller-blading around town, Amma playing silently with her giant dollhouse, shots of the child Camille being chased through the woods by a group of jocks, shots of Camille filling a water bottle with vodka.There\\'s a lot to admire in Sharp Objects, but precious little to like. Although not exactly a work of post-MeToo fempowerment, it certainly has a female-centric perspective, and its examination of issues usually associated with men is interesting, saying some fascinating things about female trauma. The performances are top-notch and the editing is decent (albeit overused), but all in all, the show did little for me. I understand that it\\'s designed holistically rather than cumulatively, and I have no problem with that. But the pace is enervating and the characters just aren\\'t interesting enough to fill such a lengthy runtime.',\n",

Patricia Clarkson's portrayal of Camille's narcissistic, self-absorbed mother is equally effective: you'll find yourself wanting to choke her in every episode. Also so refreshing to see women's lives and stories portrayed in a non-exploitative way.

       "  'Hard to assign this series a number of stars, some aspects 10, others 1. The acting was stellar, making the characters believable in their almost unprecedentedly dysfunctional family crucible. And kudos to the way cinematography and editing created the most vivid \\'inside\\' view of the mental tortures of PTSD that I know of on film, paralleling the way that A Beautiful Mind put us inside the mental labyrinths of paranoid schizophrenia. (For those commenters who have complained here about the erratic and incessant flashbacks, literally \"flash\" backs, and found them inexplicable, this would be my response: you were seeing a depiction of the manifestation of PTSD. Imagine how anguishing then it is for an actual PTSD sufferer plagued by all such \\'cuts\\' and slices of trauma bombarding their mental visions, unrelentingly.)But the artistry which achieved that depiction of PTSD is also a disjunct with the series ending where even more frenetic, barely visible cutting and slicing of flashes of violence -- seeming to be in the same vein as Camille\\'s PTSD that we\\'ve been immersed into, racheted up in the splicings into the final credits as if on steroids, cannot serve the same purpose (in terms of the medium being the message) and thus left me with a sour end note as to director\\'s choices. Those mid-closing- credits scenes were not illustrations of the workings of PTSD; they struck me (and my husband) instead as kind of cheap shortcut twists to stab us, the viewer with, so as to shake us up regarding what had seemed to be the series\\' final verdict on its crimes and punishments. Those cinematic/editing choices rode in on the backs of Camille\\'s PTSD depictions, so to speak, but they violated the exclusive use of those choices up to that point for illustrating PTSD. These could not plausibly (story perspective wise) be Amma\\'s PTSD, they were instead a break away into some \"omniscient narrator\" visuals. And while the series did put us into the POV of multiple characters, including Amma, that never included entering into anyone else\\'s but Camille\\'s PTSD-flashback experience/sensations.So that attempted conflating of a use of a film-editing \\'device\\' to illustrate PTSD and then in the last frames of the whole film to use that same \\'device\\' for some wholly other purpose was, for me, a sort of sabotage. And perhaps also a degree of disrespect for the story and/or the viewer to relegate such a story twist to a barely recognizable insertion mid-final-credits. Other films have deftly left us with final twists that \\'owned\\' themselves, for one thing by coming before final credits - films for example that leave us with some micro last-minute filmed focus on a detail that changes everything, such as making us know that we\\'d been watching someone\\'s dream rather than \\'reality\\' - \"Mulholland Drive\" and \"Take Shelter\" come to mind. Their endings then became controversial fare for folks like us to debate as to what their ramifications and implications were for reframing the entire film\\'s plotline, but that works. Sharp Object\\'s post-ending ending just felt shortchanged and inappropriate to the film\\'s chosen form-function schema.(It also felt a bit cheap storytelling-wise to have Adora, in her very last extended scene with Camille, segue into a bit of her own backstory to telegraph to the viewer that she came by her dysfunctions \"legitimately\" i.e., handed down by her own mother to her. I would suspect that the novel did not wait until the last minute to weave that message into the telling.)As an aside, viscerally, the hardest thing in the film for me was getting my mind around Camille\\'s cutting. Most specifically, was she supposed to have engaged, at least sometimes in \\'collaborative cutting\\' à la tattooing? How could she have \\'achieved\\' those cuttings into her back? Unlike tattooing, which is inherently social, cutting is a very isolationist dis-ease; it felt disrespectful of the viewer not to give any kind of accounting for how those backside word-cuts could have happened, thus leaving it in the realm of implausibility.',\n",

I gave it a try but I definitely will not waste any more time on this.'],\n",
       " [\"First off, I enjoyed Season 1 of The 100. Season 3 was inferior compared to other seasons.The 100 is an American post-apocalyptic drama television series. I love The 100 because it has a unique story line. 97 years after a nuclear apocalypse, 100 prisoners sent down to the earth to see if it is survivable for the ark and it's lacking resources. This show is another amazing and intriguing apocalyptic show that has caught my attention. I was sceptical at first as I am not a huge fan of the CW's channel however I realised that this is an exception to that thought. I have so far really enjoyed watching it and am hooked. If you like The Walking Dead, Revolution or Lost then you will love this show! If you like apocalytic, intense, thrilling, quality dramas, this is your show. It has a nuclear and isolated feel to it and it has yet to disappoint me. If you like the show too, please spread the word as much as possible, the show can't survive without support and good ratings so encourage those around you.There are so many cool sci fi themes and issues in the show that it really keeps you interested in watching. Characters are also very interesting and bring you in. I would highly recommend this show to any sci fi fan! You won't be disappointed. 8/10\",\n",

I stayed with it mostly for the interesting concept.And wow, the second season develops into one of the most exciting programs out there right now. The storyline moves around like lightening, the characters go on believable arcs which deliver amazing transformations in some cases, it's highly original and creates some fascinating dynamics between characters which you don't see anywhere else. OK it's not perfect (sometimes the science makes me frown) but it does so much right I barely pay attention to the increasingly rare blips now.Heading towards the end of season 2, every scene is compelling and feels important and you care about what happens because they have built it in the right way. Don't expect the fluffy love stories CW is famous for, this is in no way a show just for teenagers, it's not afraid to kill people, and deaths are permanent (thank goodness). The way they bring up questions of morality and strategy, the ambiguity of the characters, the head on approach to the subject matter, all are fascinating. It's gritty and edgy with excellent production value and the only other program I'm getting the same level of epic from right now is Game of Thrones.I've never written a review before but I just had to support this show and want it to get past any stigma it created in the initial episodes. Check out the ratings in season 2, those are earned and well-deserved. Binge watch it people! You won't regret it.\",\n",

It is needless to say that the show is going to ask viewers to suspend their disbelief for the 40 minutes it takes to watch an episode. A lot of people tend to criticize the show for being unrealistic scientifically. The problem with this being that of course the show is going to be unrealistic. You have to accept that the premise of the show is that 100 teens get stranded on earth by their race of space people 100 years after a nuclear disaster.Sometimes television programs don't abide by standard rules of physics, or any kind of science for that matter. Sometimes that's what television is there for - to give you a break from the believable. If you are a stickler for scientific accuracy or a big fan of classic sci-fi the reality is that this might not be the show for you. If, however, you are someone looking for something exciting and (honestly) addicting to watch you might be in luck.In regards to the script I can honestly say that I suffered through 90210 cringing all the way and while some of The 100's script might be a little cringe-worthy to start, it is certainly much better than most (if not all) of the teen dramas on television.

Most of the bloodier scenes take place in a dark place or is carefully done by camera angles to get the point across but to not upset the CW's typical viewers, and this is great in a world of The Walking Death and Game of Thrones, etc. It's a welcome method of delivering the same intensity without being overly grotesque.

It has an allure, the concept is what makes it interesting. I can poke holes in every well liked show, as i'm sure many others can. I kept watching because I felt the show had potential, no matter what route it took. There are still things that irk me about this show, but the things i enjoy outweigh the things I don't.

I watched episode after episode and finished the first season in 3 days (this is watching back to back episodes after 10 hour work days). I love this show because it left me wanting more and I enjoyed watching it. They made some bold choices by deciding to show certain things as well which made it more realistic (regarding human behavior). I can definitely say it gets more exciting. I felt myself predicting things that might happen, but expecting them not too because it seemed too daring for TV, but I was pleasantly surprised. My overall advice is that you don't go in watching it with this grand idea of it (not to say it isn't grand, but romanticizing it in your head can easily turn into disappointment), and just give it the chance it deserves.\",\n",

In attempting to heighten/prolong the drama, characters would make such stupid game-changing decisions, forcing me to smack my forehead in frustration throughout the series.Someone in charge set this show to 90% conflict and 8% angst (not to mention 2% female-on-female action), and all manner of shenanigans ensued to maintain that level.Loyalty-switching was all the rage. (I can\\'t say, \"Like they changed their underwear\", because Grounders probably go commando).There were various timely yet ill-advised massacres to ensure that peace existed only during the ad-breaks.There were several cliff-hanger countdown moments that were missed due to lengthy hand-wringing and \"Hey, we know that time is running out but let\\'s pull dramatic faces and talk about it some more\".A sprinkling of common-sense decisions would have made this so much more enjoyable.I should mention the good stuff before I run out of puff. Ricky Whittle as Lincoln gets top marks for the Grounder torn between two cultures. Alycia Debnam-Carey nailed the role of Lexa. All that violence in such a cute package.

       "  '(A science-fiction series about teenagers sent on Earth to examine if it\\'s finally livable again after a nuclear apocalypse that happened almost 100 years ago and forced the survivors to live in space stations.)In the beginning of season 1, the 100 was basically a cheesy teen show, but then at some point the tone changed. And season 2 was what it could have been as its best: a show that explores what is morally right and wrong when you are desperate to survive. How far can you go and still be deserving of surviving? There was still unintended melodramatic tackiness in it, but it was going to the right direction.But instead of continuing with this tone and enhancing and deepening the morality aspect, they decided in season 3 to go for a shock value road. Traumatic things just happen now to characters but they are never really explored. They build up tension, then there\\'s the shocking moment, and then it\\'s ignored. Viewers don\\'t get a satisfying emotional payoff for the suspense.It\\'s like the writers are fixated serving \"unexpected\" shock value moments after another. I write \"unexpected\", because in reality they are just repeating story lines and doing do overs from a slightly different ankle. Unexpected deaths become expected deaths. Especially if you are a love interest for one of the main characters...The writers don\\'t seem to care that much, what these traumatic moments and hardships would actually do to a person and how that should affect the writing of these characters in the long run. It\\'s forgotten or it\\'s explained away with an off screen development. Or you can just write that chip in the character\\'s head made the character do it, so does it even matter what they did, said etc.?Things just happen because they happen. Because it\\'s \"shocking\", because \"you don\\'t see it coming\", because it\\'s \"surprising\"... The morality aspect and the emotional effects are wiped away. Basically whatever the characters do, they just write them to parrot: \"it\\'s us against them, I had to do it, you had to do it, my people, my people, my people, for our people\".No deeper push or a meaning is needed for a genocide. No deeper meaning is needed for wanting your sibling suddenly to die, no deeper meaning is needed to torture someone etc. Even child abuse is presented simply as a way to protect that child, because the child is \"my people, us against them, I torture my child, so no one else can use her etc.\". And then it\\'s ignored. Everything is fine again. It\\'s very cheap writing. Characters become just soulless plot devices who never stop to think or feel or reflect what\\'s happening and what are they doing. They just do whatever they have to while repeating those same old catchphrases like brain-dead robots.There is also no reason to trust any character development you think you see on the screen, because the writers seem to get fed up easily with previously written character arcs. So the characters and relationships are basically rewritten in every season. It\\'s really odd that also the relationships form \"as a surprise\". The writers seem to think that it would be boring, if there\\'s actual on screen development and the viewers would see the relationships evolving. It has to be a shock and a surprise too.But anyways, by season 5 you don\\'t even recognize the characters anymore. I guess it\\'s fun for the writers and the actors, as they get to do something new and play a different character every season, but this leads viewers to feel detached. There is no continuation or coherence in the storytelling. The characters don\\'t learn anything. It\\'s like they forget what they have experienced. They repeat the same things or are continuously unable to see the other side, even though they have self experienced that other side! And when viewers become more and more detached because of this poor and lazy writing, it leads to a realization that you don\\'t even care who survives anymore. Which is pretty bad if you are watching a survival show.The choice to mix up relationships, dynamics and even personalities and writing the characters to betray someone just because suddenly \"my people\" is different than previously, makes all their bonds seem meaningless. One moment they are friends and the next moment they torture each other, betray each other, leave each other to die etc. And again these things are ignored. They just write a fast and easy fix to start a new plot with new dynamics. Viewers don\\'t get to see the effects of betrayals on their relationships.Characters don\\'t really discuss about these things either. The dialogue becomes more and more shallow and by season 5 characters basically just repeat already used catchphrases. It\\'s very hard to sell these relationships as something true and deep, when characters don\\'t ever really seem to talk honestly and directly with each other. How can you claim that your main characters are soul mates and best friends, when you don\\'t write them to talk to each other?It\\'s so odd it becomes extremely funny when the characters have their most \"meaningful\" discussions through middle hands. They use for example the other one\\'s child or the other one\\'s significant other as messengers. Or even a dead girlfriend who talks through the head of the other one\\'s child! Whatever it takes to avoid an actual direct conversation, I guess. For some reason the writers just don\\'t want to let their own main characters, who are supposed to be best friends, to talk to each other. Weir, weird, weird.So it\\'s a very, very plot driven show. Which is kind of ironic, bc there\\'s also a lot of plot holes in it. And because the writers have such an urge to invent something new all the time (it\\'s predictable nonsense most of the time) and reinvent the characters, all the twists and turns and shocks feel very forced if you pay closer attention to them. So even a plot driven viewer needs to ignore quite a lot of stuff to enjoy it. When the pace is quick enough, I guess ignoring is possible. But when there\\'s time to reflect what actually was shown, you probably start to feel like someone thinks you are a very stupid viewer to write something like this and thinking it\\'s good enough.For a viewer who enjoys watching the development of the characters, it becomes a very frustrating show. If you like to understand the characters, get to know how they think and feel, and how situations effect them, this is definitely not a show for you.',\n",

Full of action, drama, surprises, and unpredictability.\\nSeasons (4, 5, 6) as you go further in the series it becomes total opposite. Full of dumb fiction that is only fitted to make the main characters (Clarke & Bellamy) who by the way happen to be the top 2 annoying characters in this show ever.\\nMy Advice: Either watch until end of season 3 or Don\\'t watch it all.\\n*Spoiler Alert* ( in case you plan on watching passed season 3 )\\nTo the point that towards the end of it you\\'ll be rooting and hoping that they die especially when Clarke was so close to. However as boring and predictable it is the writer saved Clarke over and over with so many ridiculous ways including surviving a brain wipe, death by root plants while hidden in a secret hatch, and a magical CPR by Bellamy that revives her \"brain\" haha.\\nWhat is very clear, is that the worse thing about this show was the writers.\\nWhat is not clear, is why depressing characters that had so much potential and were fan favorite like Octavia, and even killing off characters earlier on that could have had much better role and added much better story in the series such as Lincoln, Finn.\\nOf course in the end, the go to another planet, kill an entire civilization and win every obstacle against all odds, by any means without losing any of the main characters (unless you count Abby as main character) and yet Clarke, Bellamy, Madi. All alive and well. Only characters that we were happy to see alive were Octavia (who was killed in last scene) and Murphy even though they turned both of them into puppies in the last season to help Clarke and Bellamy.\\nBottom line; one of those series that started well the writers started to run out of good idea so kept going with crappy ideas.

I started watching it, and I literary could not take it anymore after 6 or 7 episodes... horribly acted! The acting in this show its quite good. I find the characters on this show a lot more interesting, probably because they are criminals, so you kinda want to know what each of them did.It also have that element of uncertainty that shows like the vampire diaries, teen wolf or the originals have, where even the main characters can be killed off, which makes the show even more interesting.

The show is yet another attempt to cash in on the Twilight formula of taking what used to be nerd-fodder (fantasy, horror, sci-fi) and turning it into teenage/highschool drama nonsense.In addition to that, the show asks us to ignore massive internal contradictions that turn the whole premise into a joke pretty much. It\\'s bad writing in addition to bad acting.1. We are supposed to believe that the powers-to-be that preside over the last remnants of humanity (4000 people) would willingly send a sizable number of healthy, attractive breeding age females to almost certain death. That does not appear to be a particularly good idea if the survival of the species is the goal.2. We are supposed to believe that they would send their young and healthy to Earth, i.e. into mortal danger, because of resource constraints, rather than the old and sick or other non-essential persons.3. We are supposed to believe that, unless you\\'re a minor, even small infractions carry a death sentence, even though it would be highly likely that virtually everyone on such a space station would need to have very specific tasks requiring a very specific skill set - making such a scenario highly unlikely.4. We are supposed to believe that, after 3 generations on a resource-constrained space station, there is still plenty of shaving supplies, eyeliner, mascara and so on so that everyone can look like a perfectly groomed fashion catalog model.5. We are supposed to believe that out of a total population of 4000 there are 100 juvenile delinquents. 6. We are supposed to believe that they have the technology to monitor life signs in real-time from space but they don\\'t even have a single Geiger counter to measure radioactive radiation.7. We are supposed to believe that the \"delinquents\", after growing up in what one must assume to be a HIGHLY reglemented society, would go Lord of the Flies pretty much the very minute they touch down on Earth.I could continue this list, but it\\'s pointless. The whole thing is a complete mess.',\n",

And I personally think the makers did a good casting and most of them are doing good at acting their roles.

       "  'This show is unimaginably stupid. The only thing that amazes me more than the fact that it was renewed for a second season is the fact that some people actually consider this science fiction. With their laughable portrayal of conditional gravity in orbit and magic radiation on the surface of the planet, the writers appear to harbor not only ignorance but an active disdain for basic science. The list of plot holes in this show is unending. The writers seem to delight in throwing them out there just to see if the audience is even paying enough attention to catch them or is too distracted by Paige Turco\\'s holographic eye mascara.The character development can best be described as \"schizophrenic\". The writers\\' idea of depth of character is turning antagonists into protagonists and back again sometimes within the span of single episodes. Half the actors appear embarrassed to be part of such an illogical piece of teen-drama crap and the other half are just excited to have a job. But what more do you expect from CW?There is nothing to like about this show. I fear for the intelligence of reviewers who advise turning a blind eye to plot holes and terrible writing. You have to be a certain type easily entertained simpleton to find The 100 a show worth watching.For your benefit (and as a response to the naive positive reviews) I\\'ve listed just a few of the most glaring holes and general problems with the plot below. Unless you\\'re particularly skilled at suspending disbelief to the point of completely shutting off your brain, this show is not for you.1) Portions of the Ark are rotating presumably to provide artificial gravity, a concept the artists at least peripherally understood but the script writers do not. One scene in S2E8 even involves turning gravity on and off like a light bulb. 2) Solar radiation in low Earth orbit is not the same as nuclear radiation from thermonuclear weapons detonations. Nuclear radiation from weapons detonations dissipates over the course of weeks (which is why Nagasaki is currently inhabited by half a million people, for example). 3) Even with exposure to the most intense radiation at Chernobyl, the type of instantaneous tissue damage and death from fallout radiation shown in the series isn\\'t even close to being realistic. It is apparent that the writers have absolutely no idea what radiation actually is. 4) Blood transfusions are not going to magically protect tissue from nuclear radiation. 5) 97 years is not long enough for natural selection to evolve a population of humans 4,000 strong which is 100% resistant to anything. 6) If there\\'s still enough magic radiation on the surface to instantly kill people, why did the Ark decide to wait almost 100 years before sending people down since it wouldn\\'t have made a difference either way? 7) They seem to do just fine consistently treating stab wounds, broken bones, concussions, etc. without any medical supplies or training to speak of and with a 100% success rate and an average recovery time of a day or so. 8) How could a nuclear war have succeeded in destroying not only all traces of technology but all traces of written language on the surface of the planet such that the majority of surviving humanity would be reverted some tens of thousands of years? That\\'s right, tens of thousands. We\\'ve had agriculture for the last 12,000 years. 9) The 100 happens upon a cache of automatic weapons after having been on the ground for what, a week? Meanwhile, the people who\\'ve been living on the ground for the last century have given up on technology and are throwing spears at one another and riding horses around. 10) Why did the \"grounders\" (stupid name) bother to invent a new Pidgin English language if they all still speak common English fluently and without even so much as an accent?',\n",
       "  'The premise for the show is actually good, a great idea that could have been a great show, but \"The 100\" completely fails with the execution. It is nothing but a hormone infested high school drama masked as a Sci-fi show. 100 kids are sent to a previous radioactive unlivable Earth to determine if the planet is suitable for life again, great idea right? But what\\'s the first thing these kids do when they get there? Separate into groups of who\\'s cool and who isn\\'t, while anyone speaking reason that they need to find shelter/food/anything else required to survive, are just bullied and threatened with their life.

Some concepts were odd. Like the technological inconsistencies. However, as you learn more about the Ark, it becomes obvious that the resource situation is hard. Make-up. Well, most shows suffer from everyone having make-up, when they shouldn\\'t. It\\'s a TV thing. What is important is the story. What I like about it is how the teens on Earth are still teens. They have their love life and general angst, but they are also trying to be adults. Sometimes it\\'s almost \"Lord of the Flies\", but then the characters stiffen their spine and make the hard choices. In a way, it\\'s like a study of society and people.

       "  \"SPOILERS******I think too many people took the title of the show too seriously. A lot of people wondered why Ted decided to sit down and tell his kids a story about meeting their mother which included his ex-girlfriends. Well without some of the girlfriends, he would not have grown and become the man he did. He also would not have lucked into the opportunity of meeting their mother. And without those stories we would have not had a TV show. The show has a great combination of funny and heartfelt moments going on that I've only seen matched with Friends and Scrubs. There were some episodes along the way in season 7-9 that were forgettable but a lot of shows get like that when they're on past their prime. Now that I know the full story and that Ted ends up with Robin, I want to watch the entire series over. To me it makes perfect sense to end the show the way they did, because Robin was a main character to the story and not necessarily so with Tracy. It was clear through most of the series that Robin was the one that got away from Ted and the one that had the biggest impact on him. Robin helped make Ted into the man that the kids saw and helped shape him into the man that would fall in love with their mother. Barney's story was also very interesting. A lot of people felt that the writers undid all of his development in one show. The thing I like about what they did, was that it felt real. Barney's character was complex. He had been let down throughout his life and had his own very deep seeded psychological problems. Those were not necessarily gone by the time he married Robin. I think they were still within him, hence the jokes that he was still able to make about other women's boobs and so on. The thing Barney gained from his relationship with Robin was that she helped him love someone. She helped him see that he was capable of doing so. Little by little, Nora, then Quinn, then Robin helped Barney see that he was capable of more. I think Barney was heartbroken by his marriage with Robin. He felt that it was going to be a certain way. He was as excited if not more excited than her to be married to each other. Hence his nervousness leading up to the wedding and how perfect he wanted it to be. I just think that he couldn't handle what their relationship was becoming kind of like the first go around. He loved her too much to lie to her. But he learned how to love and become a bit more stable. His 31 day spree after his divorce was more about him going to a dark place than it was about him wanting to be that guy. The other thing is that Robin never would have been able to give Barney a child. His daughter was the love of his life and I found that sweet. She changed him forever. Going back to Ted and Robin. What people might forget is that present Ted is telling the story and not past Ted. People felt like he wasn't genuine in his love for the mother Tracy. I think he loved her with every ounce of his heart. Present Ted was 6 years removed from his wife's death. He wanted to tell his kids the story of how he met the most incredible woman of his life. The only problem was that there was more than one woman that had that effect on him. He just didn't realize the effect Robin still had on him and how important she was to him. His kids helped him realize that. He wasn't the only person in the story who loved multiple people. Robin fell in love with two different men and Tracy had fallen in love with Max before Ted. The show was very real in that sense. So to sum it up, the mother was a Macguffin but a very beautiful one and one that helped the story have a direction. The last scene b/w the mother and Ted where they finally met was beautifully written and acted. And the final scene to me has not stopped running through my head. The music hit, and Robin brought out the romantic side of Ted again. No words needed to be spoken there and I'm happy for that. We all knew and in the end I was happy b/c these fantastic characters that I've come to love were all in a better place.\",\n",
       "  'I\\'ve enjoyed the first few episodes of this post \"Friends\" comedy. It really captures some of the humorous albeit awkward situations that late twenty-somethings are finding themselves in these days.Alyson Hannigan once again presents her hilarious, quirky sense of style and humor. Along with her boyfriend, Marshall, they are an excellent representation of the couple who are trying to figure out an identity in the \"not still partying like college kids, but trying not to be all grown up\" stage of life.The lead character, Ted, provides great entertainment. Audiences will be drawn in by his sensitivity and likability. He\\'s not desperate to get married, but merely ready to find the One, tired of game playing.Overall, I think this is a half-hour well spent.

At least it explains Ted's twisted story-telling and why it took 8 seasons before we actually got to meet the mother. And true, it was sad that she dies, but Marshall's dad also passed away, which i found way more depressing. Having Ted show up at Robins apartment with the blue horn was bittersweet and basically brought it to a full circle. Barney finally committed to a female who will turn out awesome, when she grows up. Marshall and Lily are the perfect couple as you always knew they would be.I congratulate Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for having the courage to not end HIMYM like any mediocre sitcom would and want to thank them for almost a decade filled with laughter and sometimes tears (sometimes both at the same time) because the characters they created felt multi-layered and so real at times you wished they were actual friends you could hang out with at MacLaren's pub. It never got boring to watch, even if Ted seems a bit whiny sometimes and when re-watching the show you finally notice that Lily is a bitch.

It\\'s like panic attack, you can\\'t describe it too, you know. But these thoughts are good. I started watching in 2005. As you know start day is September 19, 2005. If I remember true, I started on October. Anyway, I have no idea what will happen in this show in the future. I have never expecting to watch it for the last episode. This show is different then others, it\\'s teaching many things to it\\'s followers; friendship, love, kindness, sacrifice, generosity et cetera and et cetera.To tell you the truth, I did not establish a deep friendship until now. I tried too much, but why is it not work, really I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. Ted, Barney, Marshall, Robin and Lily taught me too much things about friendship, love, kindness, sacrifice, generosity. I learned more. Until now, I learned that there are too many things that I must learn. You look like you have too much free time in my country. But in the end, there is a free time they seen but you have not, and they are steal your free time for nothing... Instead of this, I can travel to more country, and learn more. I can work more, more and more for me and my family, friends... It\\'s started eat my mind.Anyway, as I said, I have watched How I Met Your Mother too many times. And this show, these cast and the team, who are stayed background, taught me too many things. I\\'m still continuing to watch this show on TV. Even I realized that, I have to own bundle box of this show. I found a site, and I will buy this bundle.Maybe you said, \"I don\\'t understand why you are yelling?\" Believe me, there are some things that can hurt. HIMYM helped recognize myself. I believe that, all of these main cast is reflects an idea. Ted is ambitious for his dreams. If you believe, you can do anything. Barney is looks like lecher, but he is not. Just like Ted, he is looking for a door to happiness. Lily. Ah she is adorable and interesting person (but she is very professional to hide her thoughts). Robin is unperturbed, but she is very professional just like Lily. She is hiding her good feelings during some situations. Marshall is childish, and this is a virtue too.As you see, I discovered these emotions in these characters. All of them was a very good lesson for me; Always be an ambitious, and release your emotions while reaching to these dreams. But at the same time, be lecher for your dreams. Do interesting things and do not listen/see what people talking about yourself about these situations. And of course, don\\'t forget to do some childish things.

Marshal and Lilly are Ted's best friends they are together for 9 years and are planning a wedding with all the consequences coming from that. Barny is the Casanova of the company.

Every character in the CBS show (5 in total) are likable but I must give extra kudos to the characters played by Alyson Hannigan (Lily), and Neil Patrick Harris (Barney). I may be biased towards my liking of Alyson Hannigan\\'s Lily (due to her previous comedic roles: American Pie Series, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but she brings a charm and charismatic flair to the show. Also Neil Patrick Harris\\' Barney is GREAT!!! He basically plays a creep which I\\'m sure everyone is familiar with (because I know I sure am!). I find Barney hilarious!!! He IS that creepy guy at the club but that\\'s what makes him lovable.All in all this show has potential! As long as the stories, acting and writing keep up then I am definitely going to tune in! I think once people start getting to know the characters better, they\\'ll start tuning in as well.

I laughed continuously when everyone kept on dismissing his ideal of them all wearing suits. Its great that Doogie finally comes back to television in a great new series. Their are other great characters i feel give great comedy to the show such as the couple Lily (Alyson Hannigan) and Marshall (Jason Segal) who make a great team. They have those romantic, but hilarious scenes together where you have those laugh out loud moments. Then you finally have Robin (Cobie Smulders) who is seen as \"the one\" at first, but turns out to not actually be Ted\\'s future wife. She has her funny moments, but i don\\'t really see her as funny as the rest of the characters.Thats basically what people need to know about this show. Most of the actors we have never heard of and haven\\'t seen in movies or shows in awhile, but this is great stardom for them. It\\'s a great show for everyone to watch for it has great comedy and writing to it. It\\'s nothing really what i expected though when i saw the previews for the pilot. Just give this show a chance, you won\\'t be disappointed. It def. has a potential to last some more seasons.',\n",
       "  \"I don't have much in the way of a review other than to say that based on the pilot, I think this show has a lot of potential to be a really good show. The cast is funny and endearing and the premise is fun. It might not be the most original idea for the show (think Wonder Years) but it has it's own little twist that should make for some interesting episodes. Hopefully next weeks episode will be just as watchable and entertaining. If you haven't checked it out, I recommend that you do. Alyson Hannigan and Neil Patrick Harris are the perfect complements to the show. The rest of the cast is somewhat unfamiliar to me though I must admit. I recall seeing Jason Segel in Freaks and Geeks, but I haven't really seen him in anything as impressive since so hopefully he'll bring the same originality he showed as Nick to his new character, Marshall. Josh Radnor is the newcomer in the bunch and he is just perfect for the part. He's cute yet dorky, with a lovable charm that will certainly endear him to many female viewers. I see only good things on the horizon for this show and I hope it finds a permanent home at CBS.\",\n",
       "  \"The perfect amount of drama and comedy.\\nEvery character is perfectly developed and very rarely go outside of their core personality. I have seen every single episode and can say that our of 208 of them I might not have liked maybe 8. All the other episodes are captivating, unexpected, funny, accurate, realistic, full of positivity, and after you've seen all of them in the end you'll be a little bit better as a person. At least that's what it did for me.\",\n",
       "  \"This review will fall into two pieces, inspired by the latest 2 episodes ( seriously guys, what the f... is going on with the musical bits and ridiculous rhyming).Until season 5, somewhere mid-season 6: some of the best comedy I have ever seen. Hilarious, right on the spot, with great one-liners and characters. Absolutely wonderful.Anything after that: what the f... went wrong? Lame jokes, terrible musical bits, awful dialogue, just plain awful TV. And yet somehow, I am still watching, just to see the last episode. Com' on guys, this should have finished 3-4 seasons ago: on your epic legendary peakness.Thanks for all the wonderful laughs, but wow, you really overstayed your stay!!\",\n",
       "  \"I loved this show. Unfortunately, the ninth series is increasingly putting the past tense into that statement. The whole nonsense of having Marshall travelling rather than present is tedious. And he really is important to the group chemistry, which is increasingly unbalanced. The flashbacks are getting contradictory. Dragging out 3 days into a whole series is just stupid.It is still watchable, but there is none of the magic or the emotional investment that has been present in the first 8 series. And now we have seen the Mother and having her as a permanent recurring cast member, why can't we just write her in properly and get on with having Ted meet her?!\",\n",
       "  \"How I met your mother is definitely one of the best American sitcom. It is the funniest dramas with eccentric humor I have ever seen. The producers of this comedy, Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, created an entertaining romantic story full of awkward and amusing moments, so I have not one bad word to say about it. This comedy, with interesting plot and irresistible characters, is certainly my favorite.The story is about the adventures of architect Ted Mosby and his friends, and how he met the mother of his children. However, the comedy is not similar to a traditional love-story, which begins from the moment when the romantic leads first meet each other. The structure of this drama is absolutely unique, Ted Mosby does not introduce his wife until the final season. Additionally, the series start with Ted retelling to his children in 2030 the story about how he was so close to meet their mother. He had been seeking his love for 8 years. Ted failed a lot, but his crazy friends every time provided him social and emotional support. With a lovely couple Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin, womanizer Barney Sticnson with a secret job (you also will find out it only in the final season) and funny anchor Robin Sharbatsky, Ted has unforgettable adventures and a number of ridiculous stories.How I met your mother is suitable for everyone. It's a really positive, humorous and amazing comedy, which you can watch with your friends and with your family as well. However, parents need to know that this comedy focuses on flirting, love and relationships, includes sexual jokes and some vulgar language. On the other hand, some obscene things are substituted with interesting activities, and it makes stories more comical. At the same time this drama has controversial ending, which suggests that sometimes life has no happy endings. Overall It's easy watching sitcom with different funny story lines, so you will never be bored.\",\n",
       "  'I love that they gave Aly a new show, she is so great and she deserves one. They stuck with the \"kinky girl\" persona the movie American Pie gave her, but I still like it. The show is funny and the characters are great. I can\\'t wait to see who Ted ends up with. The TV show may be a little silly at times, but I like it a lot, and I intend to watch it every Monday night. I don\\'t know if the show can have multiple seasons since it\\'s a one story type of thing, but if they can figure out how to do it, then I hope they do it. Anyways, I give high praises to the show, and I hope it sticks around longer than some of these other TV series, like Head Cases. Kandis',\n",
       "  'How can I say it respectfully? hmm.... It\\'s disgustingly boring and insultingly illogical.I admit that season 1 and 2 were extremely well made. Maybe it is the reason why I am now extremely disappointed. The writers only uses tricks of \"sudden turns of events\" to generate funny moments. Having watched many episodes of this show, all I see is that characters constantly changing their beliefs, decisions, and actions back and forth without any logical reasons: we two must break up, no, we must get back together, no, that\\'s just impulse, we should still break up, no, that\\'s true love, we must get back together, no, it\\'s true love because we wanted it to be, we should break up...... The show is not making too much sense now. The five figures in the show don\\'t have consistent characters any more. You can not ask such questions: \"how could this person possibly do such a thing?\" Because you won\\'t have any logical answers. Maybe this is exactly what American shows are about: like fast food, you don\\'t need to enjoy it, just swallow what is given to you. Sometimes, you stop and think \"wait a minute, this doesn\\'t make sense, doesn\\'t XX just did something exactly the opposite a minute ago?\" No, you can\\'t. The writers just throw to you another contradictory joke and you are moving on.I feel deeply insulted watching the show. I feel that the writers assume that audience never think deeper than the superficial meaning of the jokes while watching shows, which is not true.Deeply disappointed.',\n",

This show is a terrible rip-off of 'FRIENDS' and I am insulting FRIENDS by comparing HIMYM with it. I mean c'mon.... the jokes are predictable and lame, the situations are kiddish, the characters live in a world of their own,the story NEVER seems to move on, they give stupid names to each and everything, the way 7-year olds do... (eg. Lets pull out the 'mosby', I've won the 'three way belt' etc. etc.) I've watched each and every episode of the show till date and have not laughed even once, smiled maybe but never laughed... whereas in shows like there Big Bang Theory, Friends, Seinfeld... I fall off my chair laughing at least once even if it is the nth time i am watching the episode....The only good thing about the show is Barney aka Neil Patrick Harris, probably the only reason I did watch every episode... otherwise the show is totally LAME....I give it 1/10 only because of him.\",\n",

I first saw it in my girlfriends house, and thought \"wow, this is actually pretty entertaining\" but then i began to think about the jokes, the characters... and the only thing that came into my mind was \"Friends\". \"OMG, this is a copy of friends!!!\" i thought, and i was right, it\\'s the exact same thing, the jokes the scenario the characters attitude and their friendship, it\\'s all there!! Now tell me, why would they make a reboot of the 90\\'s show? Because it sells, so why watch it? Just to prove my point i made a list of things that we have seen in \"Friends\" and that are similar in \"How i met your mother\" :MacLaren\\'s Pub / Central Perk.Monica & Chandler/Lily & MarshallRachel & Ross date / Robin & Ted dateRachel & Joey date / Robin&Barney dateJoey\\'s a womanizer / Barney is a womanizer.Barney and Phoebe don\\'t know who their dad is. Both have been lied by their mother/grandmother respectively.Ross & Ted both end up as professors.Emily didn\\'t want Rachel to be around Ross / Stella with Robin..And the list goes on...So that\\'s that, \"How i met you\\'re mother\" is like a show made for kids, it has stupid/childish jokes, it has loving/clichéd characters, and it has a moral in the end of every episode, to give us that worm feeling that everything is going to be alright... Man this show is the basic form of a US comedy, it always has been this way, and it will stay this way until people realize that sh*t like this is boring, repetitive and simple has hell, kinda like pop music these days, but that\\'s another story...',\n",

Time to bring it all to an end and move on to something watchable.The situations are poor and the execution of them is laboured. It is almost as though a team of writers have come together to think up the most obvious, in your face, situations and have then proceeded script them. One of the disadvantages of teams of scriptwriters on a show is that the ideas pass through a committee stage and most of the good ones don't get through.If it were not for the US The Office I would award this the worst comedy ever.\",\n",

I didn\\'t laugh a single time, accurately predicting almost every encounter in the first few seconds and staring at the screen in baffled wonderment. How is this show popular?! This show is essentially THE prime example of our American pursuit of laziness. We don\\'t dare watch a show that challenges our thinking or is interesting in any way, we just want to watch the same crap that has been on TV since the first fart joke debuted.I digress... This show was trashy, boring, insulting to the intelligence of a kindergartner, and poorly executed at that. In short, an epic piece of utter trash that I will avoid at all costs in the future. Others are of course entitled to their opinions, but for those unsure if they\\'d like to take a chance on it, don\\'t! I would sincerely rather watch an infomercial; it would be funnier.'],\n",
       " ['In 1980, Gloria Monty along with other General Hospital writers decided to make a couple out of two actors that had amazing chemistry.  Genie Francis and Tony Geary who have become the phenomenal Luke and Laura.  Luke and Laura made General Hospital the unforgettable soap opera it is, and still today, Luke and Laura\\'s though painful relationship, keeps viewers going through their fascinating characterization and never ending passion between them.Alan and Monica, played by Leslie Charleson and Stuart Damon, Frisco and Felicia, played by Jack and Kristina Wagner, Robert and Holly, played by Tristan Rogers and Emma Samms, Sonny and Brenda, played by Maurice Bernard and Vanessa Marcil, and Luke and Laura have showed every other soap opera the definition of a \"love story\".  Though never simple, always intense, always unforgettable.General Hospital has also shown amazing technique in storylines that are not love stories.  Such as Monica Quartermaine\\'s heartwrenching breast cancer storyline in 1994, or the amazing storyline of two little girls dying, yet only one miracle came out of it.  I could only be talking about Bobbie Spencer\\'s and Tony Jones\\'s daughter BJ giving her heart to Frisco and Felicia\\'s daughter Maxie, in the last moments to save her life.  These stories touched many viewers and there are so many more.Some of the most precious moments on daytime television have occurred on General Hospital, and the highest rated moment on daytime television was Luke and Laura\\'s wedding in 1981.  It was said to be the only wedding ever to rival Princess Diana\\'s.  General Hospital has created feelings, storylines, and characters that go beyond words.  I thank Genie and Tony who play Luke and Laura for bringing out the fantasy we all have about how love should be.  Though they are General Hospital\\'s greatest achievement, I don\\'t think General Hospital\\'s done with them yet!  And we know that Luke and Laura are not the only life changing storyline they\\'ve come up with!  Thank you General Hospital!',\n",

It is actually kind of funny how I got started watching it. One time when I was little, my mom was mad at me as I wouldn't calm down or sit still so she made me sit down and read while she watched general hospital. I remember half watching over my book when the show ended, and for some reason, I cared about what happened to Jason, so I made a point to watch it the next day and I have never missed an episode since! This is by far the best show on TV and it comes highly recommended. Hope this helps, Fletcher\",\n",

Also great performances by John Beradino,Rachel Ames, Tony Geary,Genie Francis,Tristan Rogers,Finola Hughes,Kimberly Mccullough,Vanessa Marcil,Alicia Leigh Willis and Billy Warlock.Tristan Rogers and Finola Hughes were incredible as Robert and Anna in the 80s and 90s where GH was filled with action,adventure and romance.\\nThe highlight of the 1990s included storylines of the family. BJ Jones's death, Monica Quartermaine fighting breast cancer, Stone and Robin's love story and their AIDS storyline. Plus the amazing chemistry and connection that made Sonny&Brenda soulmates.GH hit a rough patch in 2000-2001 with many backstage changes but it is improving in 2002. One of the most promising current storylines is the AJ Quartermaine and Courtney Matthews relationship. Billy Warlock and Alicia Leigh Willis have phenomenal chemistry that makes watching in 2002 a must.\",\n",
       "  \"After Santa Barbara, Guiding Light, Another World, and One Life to Live, the Soap Butcher Jill Farren Phelps has placed her friends in high position often ruining such high quality shows. When I was watching Guiding Light, it was at its peak in 1991. They fired the producer and replaced them with Butcher Phelps. She drove Beverlee McKinsey away by overworking her to death. She killed off beloved Ellen Parker's character Maureen. So Parker won an Emmy but the loss was much worse for the audience. On Another World, she killed off Alice Barrett Mitchell's beloved Mary Frances Frame Winthrop in a ridiculous storyline. On One Life to Live, I could only imagine what she did to that show which took years recover. Now she is ruining General Hospital by driving the great John Ingle away to Days Of Our Lives where he received a contract role. I feel sorry and sympathy for Jed Allan because he has a tough act to follow. The Quartermaines used to be the funnest family on television completely. She drove the great Dame Anna Lee away right before her death. Now Kristina Malandro Wagner refuses to return unless she gets a contract for playing Felicia Jones. Why aren't the veterans of this getting the short end of the stick? I bet Gloria Monty is livid over the show getting Best Drama Emmy under Phelps. I know Monty's heart was always in the right place with this show and her last time around wasn't successful as the Luke & Laura days but still, I know Butcher Phelps track record with soaps. Nobody in the real workplace would allow somebody whose cost so much damage to so many people. I am glad that Robin Strasser is speaking against Phelps' known favoritism for certain actors. I am going to single them out now on General Hospital because it would be unfair. But I know after 25 years of watching soaps, I could do a better job to satisfy both fans and the cast and crew. I am sorry but Phelps is just a Soap Opera Butcher to me. I know Guiding Light was great at the time but she made terrible decisions which cost fans. Now Guiding Light might be up for cancellation! the cast and crew took a pay cut to keep the show afloat. Remember Another World! Phelps was there before she jumped ship to One Life To Live. What goes on behind the scenes must be more fascinating than on screen. Guiding Light and Another World were creations of another daytime diva or queen Irna Phillips who would be turning over in her grave if she knew what this woman has done to her children.Now Phelps is killing off Alan Quartermaine who has been played faithfully by Stuart Damon for 30 years. I'm concerned that she is going to lose one of the show's best attributes, the Quartermaine Family. She and the network practically drove Anna Lee out over a contract dispute. Even with John Ingle's welcome return, the shadow over the show is still different. I don't blame cast members like Leslie Charleson and others for being so vocal about Damon's departure. It's as shocking as it comes. This is what you get when you have somebody like Phelps at the helm.\",\n",

Audrey and he sister Lucille? that was back in the day! i do so miss the Luke and laura thing. Luke just isn't Luke without laura. Anthony Geary has only improved with age. Luke is all that and more. GH also has the best looking guys and the sexiest, is Jax gorgeous or what? Jason is sooooooooo smooth, and all that too. it will always be hard for the writers to top the original Luke and Laura storyline,it dosen't get any better then that, but they have kept me watching all these years. to every one that is associated with the show, keep up the good work\",\n",

Be why the soap has been popular.Also the hospital thing known as scrubs as the daily scoop of the inner workings of the hospital. Hence the title! In upper NY!

It's 3rd in the ratings and I think that ain't half bad considering it's age.  The Alexis, Sonny, Carly triangle is a masterpiece destined to go down in GH's extremly long history.  The actors and actresses who portray the characters on the show are fantastic and so are the writers.  I get very upset when people say that it's a stale soap.  So when GH tries to do something exciting and fun people say that it is not true soap storytelling. Just like the revival of the Cassidines (Helena, Stavros).  I thought that that was a great storyline.  In closing I would just like to say that General Hospital is on the track to taking back the ratings crown from The Young and the Restless.  Your the greatest GH!!!!\",\n",

It's still the best soap I've ever seen. It's not as good as it used to be but it's good. I would love to see less Sonny and Carly and more Luke and (whoever). When Luke was the hero, the show as truly great. Since now it's all about Sonny, it's getting really boring. The same old mobster stuff, Sonny isn't heroic he's a crook.Maybe in the future GH will regain it's backbone. Maybe draw clear lines between good and evil like it did in it's hey day.Rayvyn\",\n",

Back in the late-70\\'s and early 80\\'s..it was THE SOAP to watch.In the early 90\\'s, when Claire and Matthew Labine took over head writing duties, General Hospital spotlighted so many fantastic, heartwrenching, and honest stories. I mean, what fan of this show will EVER forget Stone and Robin\\'s love story. Stone, dying of AIDS-blind due to it...takes his last glimpse of his love, Robin by a window and hapilly says \"I can see you\"...then passes away. Or will the forget the Breast Cancer storyline, when Monica cuts her bandages off to see that she has no breast, and she just begins to cry uncontrollably. Or, the revolutionary and GUTSY storyline when young Maxie is dying from a heart condition, and is need of a transplant. At the same time...her cousin Barbara Jean (B.J.) is rendered brain dead in a school bus accident. Tony and Bobbie decide to donate her organs. Meanwhile Felicia (Maxie\\'s mom), gets the news that a donor heart has been found. So she goes to Bobbie happy that they have found a heart for her daughter. Her happiness turns to horror when she finds Bobbie crying. Instantly, Felicia knows...\"Noooo. Not Barbara Jean. Not Barbara Jean\\'s heart.\"And she collapses to the floor, crying. I cry now as I think about it, and this was ten years ago. And then the scene where Tony hovers over Maxie, as she recovers from the transplant. And he leans down and places his ear over her chest to hear the beating heart that belonged to his deceased daughter. Oh man...This was OUTSTANDING TELEVISION!Sadly, GH has regressed so much under the watch of Bob Guza, Jr. I don\\'t care what anyone says....it\\'s BLASPHEMY to put a Spencer with a Cassadine!!! To me...this show is long gone. With the loss of some of my favorite actors (Johnathan Jackson, Amber Tamblyn, Kimberly McCullough, Sarah Brown), and some truly horiffic writing, storylines and pairings....I can never watch this show with the same enthusiasm as I did ten and twenty years ago. For me though...there are few saving graces for this show. The Quartermaines\\': John Ingle...whom not only has filled the shoes of David Lewis\\' \"Edward Quartermaine\" character...but has greatly improved on the original (and this is saying A LOT, as David Lewis was FANTASTIC as Edward), Leslie Charleson, Stuart Damon, Anna Lee, Jane Eliot (always a good watch when she returns from time to time), and Robin Christopher (GREAT). Maurice Benard as \"Sonny\" still delivers the goods. And of course, Tony Geary as \"Luke Spenser\". I just wish the material was better. Sadly, unless the Labines come back, or someone can be the second coming of Gloria Monty...I\\'ll just be a viewer on occasion.',\n",

I started watching General Hospital sometime in the 1980's shortly after Luke and Laura got married and I watched it on and off again for several years and though I don't really watch it anymore I still keep up on what is going on by reading about it in the soap opera guide in the newspaper.

Throughout the 80\\'s and early 90\\'s GH managed to ride on that loyal fan base. But during the last 7-8 years GH has struggled mainly due to LOUSY WRITING. The current scribes seem to think the audience wants to watch heroic crime-lords break the law and beloved characters die horribly. It\\'s a shame that this once cutting edge show has devolved into a show about a mobster, his moll and his cardboard cut-out henchman. ABC should either fire the current writers and producers or PULL THE PLUG on this terminal soap.',\n",
       "  \"Back in September, I thought GH was finally starting to improve but sadly that was a brief improvement and it is now downhill. Soap Operas have similar storylines sometimes but General Hospital only has the same recycled storylines. The show is predictable and boring. General Hospital has a large and wonderful cast including Robin Christopher, Nancy Lee Grahn, Tony Geary, Rebecca Herbst, Leslie Charleson, Billy Warlock, Stuart Damon, Chad Brannon and so many others. Yet General Hospital seems to waste this large ensemble cast and only use them to prop up four characters, known as the drab four (Sonny,Carly,Jason and Courtney) by some fans. General Hospital has turned into a wanna be Sopranos. They hardly ever showcase the hospital or the families. They have backburned older characters or gotten rid of them, like original cast member Rachel Ames (Audrey Hardy). The show now puts down the police and strong women like Alexis, Elizabeth, Monica and Carly. The writing is god awful and the pairings lack chemistry and are forced, especially the pairing of Jason and Courtney. Alicia Leigh Willis's Courtney showed promise in the beginning but without Billy Warlock's AJ the character and actress is a disaster. Nancy Lee Grahn's Alexis was once a strong independent lawyer who is now reduced to dressing like a man to see her daughter. General Hospital is now the worst show. It is appalling.General Hospital needs to write better for it's women, for the police and for all it's characters. They need storylines about family, love, adventure and storylines that are not about the mob. They need couples with actual chemistry that sizzle like Steve Burton and Rebecca Herbst's Jason and Liz, Zander and Emily or Alexis with either Luke, Ned, or Cameron. Ted King's return as Lorenzo Alcazar is a great move but GH does not need more characters. It needs balance, and great writing.\",\n",

(I say that because men do watch it, but mostly women) There is just enough action to keep the men interested, and enough passion to keep the women. The show is just a good show, point blank! Its plots are amazing, you never know what will happen next. Also, the characters are written to a Tee, so you fall inlove with them, and end up picking favorites, and picking those you don't like! Some people say the show is not good anymore, but i disagree. If you were to of watched back in the day, it had a much different feeling, now, mob families rule Port Charles (where General Hospital is located) But, story lines don't just center around that. If you decide to give GH a try, some characters you should look for are Edward, Monica, Alan, Luke, Tracy, Bobbie, Leslie and Audry. They are have been on the show for a long time. This show is my opinion, out of a 1-worst, 10-Best, id give it a 9. It is always keeps me entertained, but, nothing is perfect, even General Hospital!\",\n",

Sonny has brought a sexy danger to port Charles. he is the one man who you want to kiss and the man who you want to save you. The whole mobster thing is great. He loves his family and he would never hurt them. He does what he has to, to take care of them. To this day there is never a dull moment in Port Charles.

This show used to have characters that were worth rooting for and that you loved to hate. Now all it has is pathetic wannabe mobsters and characters you just hate. You're forced fed basically 4 characters Sonny, Carly, Jason and Courtney. The writing on the show is horrible and some of (if not all) the acting is horrible. Couples with no chemistry are on every single day (Jason & Courtney) while others who used to be great (Sonny & Carly) have become boring and props for other couples.

She created the Luke and Laura phenomenon, and expanded on that with far-fetched stories and international intrigue. Eventually, it became stale, as did the Luke and Laura story.Enter the 90s. New producers and writers completely changed the image of the show, from romance and intrigue to a show that set out to inform the world about diseases such as AIDS and breast cancer (something that numerous soaps had done before). Although it is good to be socially aware of the world around them, General Hospital was not like that before.Nowadays, General Hospital resembles every other soap on the air. There is no way someone can distinguish General Hospital from another show. The stories you see on this show are just like the ones you can see on any other show. And that\\'s a shame.Side note: the show rarely even takes place in the hospital anymore! What\\'s the point of calling it \"General Hospital\" when no story takes place there? And I think there are only 3 characters who are even connected to the hospital. Hello!',\n",
       "  \"Don't be fooled by the title.  While back in the golden ages this soap may have been centered around a hospital but now it's main focus really centers around the mob.  I can't say that I know it was better years ago because GH had been on many years before I was born.  The storylines of today are really lacking.  Golden couple Luke and Laura aren't on the screen and we are forced fed pathetic excuses of chemistry such as the Jason and Courtney storyline.Like most soaps General Hospital gets caught up trying to make a steamy romance build up for May to try to gain teenage viewers.  This means that we usually get some 19 to 20 something airhead with a past blow into town and start what the writer's think is a romance with a favored regular.  I am a teenager and I can tell you now that I could care less how old some of the cast members are, I want to see real romance!  Although I may not have been around to see some of the blossomings of past couples that doesn't mean I don't care!The one good actress that GH has is Robin Christopher who has played Skye Chandler on three daytime soaps and very well!General Hospital was once the most graced and respected shows on daytime TV but like most all other soaps bad writing has lost a lot of loyale viewers and failed to gain new ones.  If you're already a soap watcher then it may be worth your time to try it but if not then there isn't much for you.\",\n",
       "  'General Hospital struggled for awhile with bad writing but it is improving each and every day. It has once again become a tv show that you can\\'t miss.The pairing of Billy Warlock\\'s AJ and Alicia Leigh Willis\\'s Courtney is a breath of fresh air and they shine in an \"us against the world\", \"making him a better man\" love story.The true love story of Steve Burton\\'s Jason Morgan and Rebecca Herbst\\'s Elizabeth Webber is amazing. It\\'s full of friendship, loyalty, trust,passion,angst and love. Jason and Elizabeth are soulmates They are the best since the early days of Luke and Laura and Sonny&Brenda.\\nThe return of Vanessa Marcil as Brenda and Ted King as Alcazar is adding much excitement. All GH needs to do is reunite soulmates Sonny and Brenda and it will be all set.Also needed is storylines for Brad Maule, John J York, Stuart Damon and Leslie Charleson, Rachel Ames, Real Andrews and a good new romance or the return of Emily for Zander.These characters,couples and actors leave you wanting more and put their hearts in to their work. With improved writing General Hospital is the best soap opera to watch.',\n",
       "  \"I have watched this show for as long as I can remember. I was born in 77 and watched as a little kid. My parents were fans and I got into it (they both watched all ABC soaps). I was also a fan of AMC/OLTL/Loving/Port Charles. I knew people felt it was weird for a guy to like soaps but I didn't care... I was hooked. I remember VCR days and taping every show so I could watch after school and rushing home to catch GH in time LOL! I have fond memories of characters staring out on the show that are still on today. Luke and Laura, Frisco and Felicia, Robert and Anna, The Q's and all the bickering and backstabbing, Robin being there since she was a kid... etc. The show has changed a lot over the years but I would like to think I am as much a an today as I was back in the day.\",\n",

       "  'O.K., so I didn\\'t start watching \"GH\" in April of 1963 (I was only a month old), but found this as a teen in late spring 1979 just as Heather was about to take the L.S.D., Monica announced she was pregnant with a baby (now A.J.) and Laura and Scotty were dealing with issues in their young marriage. 34 years later, Heather is in a mental institution, occasionally springing back up to make some L.S.D. caused psychotic rant, the widowed Monica is supporting A.J. in his bid for ELQ president, and Laura and Scotty are arguing over the man who initially broke them up. Thousands of episodes later with so much having happened in the meantime, I find this enjoyably ironic and can\\'t wait until Monday to see what happens...My joke today is \"Guess where GH was today! The hospital!\" Yes, the hospital still hasn\\'t disappeared, but psychotic royal families and mobsters have taken over the majority of the episodes. Steve Hardy, the late patriarch of the hospital, is occasionally mentioned and honored, and his still beautiful widow Audrey may yet pop up again as she did recently for a dedication to him. His granddaughter Elizabeth is a nurse there, her brother (and his namesake) Steven recently was forced to resign when sent to prison for an out of state crime, and those who were around during his time share his dedication. The show\\'s veteran character, Dr. Monica Quartermain, is now chief of staff, unfortunately rarely seen (except for the occasional family squabble), and is a waste of talent for the still beautiful Leslie Charleson. Her recent reunion with former rival Lesley Webber (the exquisite Denise Alexander) shows how much \"GH\" needs its roots back as opposed to the darkened ones of the many blonde\\'s who dominate the screen.As talented an actor as Maurice Benard is, this show is \"GH\", not \"GM\" (General Mob-sital) and after years of mob-focused story lines, \"GH\" has divided the show\\'s focus between multi-generational characters. The writing is sometimes strong and the use of history amazing. Fortunately, vintage \"GH\" episodes have become available for viewing so young fans can research the show to see why \"GH\" in the late 70\\'s and 80\\'s was a true phenomenon. That brings me to the show\\'s leading man, Anthony Geary\\'s Luke Spencer, a character I found overrated years ago during the Ice Princess storyline, yet came to like as his older version of Luke was revealed to be truly flawed and not the super-hero the old regime under Gloria Monty made him out to be. I also like the fact that the 2013 version of Genie Francis\\'s Laura is much stronger, still kind but nobody\\'s patsy, even the sardonic Tracy Quartermain\\'s. Jane Elliott is a riot, stealing every scene with her presence, and in spite of their bitchy repartee, you can tell that Tracy and Monica have come to love each other in spite of old wounds often being brought up.The younger generation of Q\\'s, Corinthos, Webbers, Spencers and Cassadines are all taking on the reign of focus, and in spite of the fact that many veterans have been written off (Bobbie, Alan) or made recurring (Felicia, Monica), there are always glimpses of the glory days. Mentions of brothers Rick and Jeff Webber, original head nurse Jessie Brewer, Lee and Gail Baldwin and the late Edward and Lila are nostalgic. Seeing pictures of Anna Lee and John Ingle on the Quartermain mantle give hope for the show\\'s continuance. The show also supplies some delicious comedy whether it be Stuart Damon\\'s ghost of Alan showing up to play referee between Tracy and Monica, batty Heather going ballistic over a vampire\\'s look-alike brother, or the delightful \"dominator\" Alice displaying girl-like innocence as supporting young love. The return of long-ago veterans like Finola Hughes, Robin Mattson, Kin Shriner, Lynn Herring and Denise Alexander reminds us of the glorious \"GH\" past, which included such wonderful favorites of mine like Susan Pratt, David Lewis (the original Edward), Frank Maxwell, Judith Chapman, Tonja Walker, Matthew Ashford, Constance Towers (replacing Elizabeth Taylor as the evil Helena) and even short-term roles whose memories haven\\'t gone away played by Melinda Cordell (spy \"Natasha\"), Adrienne Barbeau, Janis Paige (an Auntie Mame like forger), and Michael Learned, so sweet to Elizabeth as a dying patient.I was never a Felicia/Frisco fan, never interested in Sonny/Brenda, and tuned out for a while regularly after Lesley Webber was \"killed off\" in 1984. But every so often, if I caught the Q\\'s on screen, I\\'d tune in for their witty \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" like conflicts, wanted to jump through my screen to hug Aunt Ruby (we should all have one!), and finally cheered for joy when Tracy made her 1989 comeback. So while \"GH\" hasn\\'t had my loyalty all the way since 1979, I\\'m like the prodigal son who can occasionally leave for greener pastures, but always ends up home.',\n",

       "  \"So am I deeply concerned about the future of GH's wonderful and exciting plots! I've been watching this soap opera for nearly one month! General Hospital had its own recommendation in my case and I had it described in the best possible quality. I was considering me joining the show and start belonging to this world,world of GH and its fans. As you can guess,I made up my mind to become a part of GH! And I still do not dare to use any bad or negative word for describing it!First of all,I would like to mention,that this soap opera really makes my every day. It is still alive and active in my dreams, it is inside me, it's a living soul in my heart. Never before have I been so obsessed about any soap opera. General Hospital can boast about its remarkable climate,atmosphere. Every episode starts with jumping from one scene to another. It's really gorgeous. It is some kind of quick skin. You can take pleasure from enjoying 5 or 6 various scenes of sometimes different stories. It makes this soap opera look versatile. It is my impression,my constant impression. What is more, General Hospital has a very fresh stories. It is linked to the world of drama, sensation...it's also stocked with joke,fun,here I have this entire story with Kate Howard and Sonny Corinthos on my mind. Their quarrels,fights and 'arguments presentations' have this power to make viewers laugh loudly in front of their TV's or computers... Furthermore,GH shows totally different characters. We watch characters,that are absolutely opposite to each other. Jerry Jacks/Jax Jacks - Jerry,who was named Craig was torturing 15 people in a hotel,treating them with a little bit of cruelty,with no honour and goodness. Jax is his younger brother,capable of sacrificing his own private life for his bad brother! Jax is the ideal brother,husband,son... Jason - Lucky. Jason is this type of man,who is supportive for women,calm,who usually respects others. Lucky is a volcano! Lucky was abandoned by his own father,Luke Spencer,that's why his behaviour makes others feel very bad for him. Disappearing of Jake let this whole amount of Lucky's anger appear and start making trouble in his life. Lucky,instead of comforting his wife Elizabeth, accused her of turning back on Jake! It made me furious! There are a lot more opposities,but I would like to leave this aspect now.Last events in GH are remarkable! Disappearing of Jake,Sam's secrets,that are coming out,Jax,who is searching for his brother,Luke taking Laura etc.! I'm just after the episode from the 27th of June and I...I am only about to say,that I'm dying to watch the next episode!Cheerz!\",\n",

       " [\"This is my first review ever, so please bear with me.Happy Endings was a terribly underrated and under-watched show that deserves very high praise. It blows both Friends and How I Met Your Mother completely out of the water (and trust me, I love both of those shows too). Each character was unique, well-developed, and hilarious! The show has a really distinct feeling to it. It was modern in the best kind of way. Penny, Max, Brad, and Jane were definitely standout characters for me. Alex and Dave were great too, but I have to admit they were not quite as interesting as the other four. Nevertheless, this show really let us get to know each character both individually and in the group setting. Plenty of memorable guest stars helped to round out the cast.The writing is smart and funny. There are inside jokes that are recurring throughout the series. I keep finding great jokes upon multiple viewings. It's both laugh-out-loud funny and make-you-think-a- little funny. This is the one show that I would pick if I could pick any show to come back onto the air. I would even give back season 4 of Arrested Development and the Veronica Mars movie (both of which I love) for more Happy Endings*. If you haven't seen this show, watch it right away and fall in love with this amazing group of friends like I did.*EDIT: Okay, I may have been a bit over-dramatic with that statement...\",\n",

This show and New Girl are the best new comedy shows and I really want them to continue. The cast is excellent and the writers are amazing and I simply cannot believe the ratings are that bad.

All of the characters are quirky in their own way, and they all get into antic situations. I'd recommend watching at least the first two episodes to get a feel for what the show is really like. Honestly, I can't wait to see how the show evolves from here, I'm sure it will be amazing!I recommend Happy Endings if you like shows like: Modern Family, 30 Rock, and Community. Do yourself a favour and WATCH THIS SHOW! I guarantee you wont be disappointed.\",\n",

The acting is great,each of the characters has something different and unique, the dialogs are funny and you get great moments of laugh. I hope this will not change later. Overall, I highly recommend this show if you've watched 'The 70s show' or 'How I Met Your Mother'. I can hardly wait for more episodes. Hopefully this will not get canceled after a few episodes like a lot of other great shows were (like Firefly or Pushing Daisies.\",\n",
       "  'This is the funniest sitcom since Arrested Development. It\\'s witty, sharp, and twisted. It gets compared to Friends a lot but the characters are jerks to each other in a similar setup as Seinfeld or Curb your Enthusiasm.Elisha Cuthbert who was the weakest link in season one has improved tremendously. She has great comic timing in playing the ditz Alex. Damon Wayons Jr. shines as Brad. He takes all the great comic attributes of his father and adds his own hilarious spin. I also love how Adam Pally as Max breaks the homosexual stereotype. He thinks just like a straight man and is rude, obnoxious, and hilarious.Every member of the cast is great and the pop culture references are as Penny would say \"Ahmazing\" When you can have a sex dream about the mom on the 90\\'s comedy dinosaurs you are a pretty funny show. Season one is good but season two and three are where the cast really shines. Check the show out if you love Community, Arrested Development, Peep Show and other witty comedies. I liked Friends but I prefer Happpy Enings!',\n",
       "  \"I read an earlier review comparing this show to 'Friends'. They couldn't be more wrong. Sure, its got the typical cast of 3 main female character and 3 main male characters, some who are in relationships and some who are single, but this seems to be the norm to most new sitcoms (ie. How I Met Your Mother, Big Bang Theory etc.) This show on the other hand is quite refreshing in a way that makes it comparable to other popular past sitcoms, yet is original and different. Flashbacks during scenes remind you of Scrubs and Family Guy yet do it in a way that doesn't make it seem like they're stealing that idea. You've really got to see it to know what I mean.So far, while writing this review only four episodes have been shown, and quite honestly, I can't wait for the next one to come out. The characters all have their own unique qualities that make them interesting and i'm sure that as the series goes on we'll get to know more about them.In my own personal opinion I would definitely recommend Happy Ending to anyone willing to open themselves up to a new sit-com.\",\n",

The characters are well defined individuals, each with their own quirks without being quirky.The first five episodes have all been laugh out loud funny. The situations have been believable and relatable but go to very funny surreal places. It's creative but the creativity all comes organically from the characters so it never seems forced.Also, no laugh track, no setup-punchline timing to make you feel stupid.\",\n",

       "  \"I had my doubts about this show at the beginning. I started watching some episode because it aired right after Modern family. But after watching a couple of random episodes, I started to get interested.The characters really grew on me, I really recognize my friends and I through them. It's funny, touching at times, well written and intelligent. They make lots of references to movies, TV shows, celebrities, so if you don't watch a lot of movies and television, you may have some trouble understanding everything. It's refreshing to see a gay character who's not a drama queen, typical type of gay guy you see on TV. Adam Pally, who plays the gay character, is awesome and my favorite. It's also so refreshing to see an interracial couple (black and white), that openly make jokes about their differences. The only thing I don't really like about this show, is Elisha Cuthbert. Although I like her and I think she is so pretty, I don't think she plays her character well. I feel like she can't find her place with the others and she doesn't really fit, like she's missing something. A lot of times, I just find her awkward. But that's just my opinion. I'll still watch the show. Maybe she'll get better with time. So overall, I think it's a super cool show. And please do not compare this series with Friends, this has nothing to do with it. It's too easy to say they are friends and do stuff together, and compare characters. It's so much more than that. I never really liked Friends and I love this show. They can't re-invent the wheel. We all have friends, a lot of them resemble others, it's based on real life that's it. I really recommend everyone to at least watch season 1 :) Then you can judge by yourself :)\",\n",

The jokes are well written and the timing is well done. One area of concern is what's in store for the couple that fell apart at the altar - I am not sure how they will handle their relationship, but so far so good. They take risks, but they pay off. The result is sweet and funny and engaging. I think it will get even better with time. I am definitely continuing to watch it!\",\n",

I love Jane (Eliza Coupe) and Brad's (Damon Wayans, Jr.) relationship - they are hilarious individually, but there's something magical about them together. They are amazingly kooky and have their own relationship shorthand, which is endearing. I can relate to Penny (Casey Wilson) on so many levels - she's just trying to get it right and she's so optimistic, even when everything goes wrong.Max, Alex and Dave are good, too, but they don't pop for me the way the other three do. I do love that they didn't go obvious and flamboyant with Max. All six together do have a wonderful rapport.Great show - I hope it's around a long time!\",\n",

Happy Ending has none of this and feels forced and fake.

It\\'s like a rotten apple in an otherwise flawless bowl of fruit.I really don\\'t want to be the jerk here, but I honestly don\\'t understand, why this show got 8.0 points here on IMDb. Yeah, the cast is good looking (Hollywood, d\\'oh) and they are generally decent actors (Hollywood, d\\'oh, pt. 2) but the characters are... well, they almost don\\'t even exist. It\\'s just a bunch of mediocre professionals, fooling around in front of a camera, without any pronounced reason, or goal whatsoever. It\\'s not the kind of stumbling around when taking the very first steps... something\\'s very wrong, that\\'s seated deeper than that.I\\'ve watched each and every pilot in the past 6 or 7 TV seasons (network or cable, everything), and there were many occasions, when I had felt like: \\'OK this was pretty bad, but I can feel it will take off, and get much better\\'. With \"Happy Endings\", I have no such feeling at all. There are just too many things that are wrong about this one. The characters that are supposed to be funny (or funnier than the others) are just not, the lines, and plots are not funny enough or at all, the ones that come through after all, are so clichéd, that if I had a penny each time I\\'ve heard of seen them, I\\'d be rich.I have a very bad feeling about a pilot, when after watching it I can\\'t remember the characters\\' names. It\\'s a dead-on indicator, that the show is badly written. Another \\'tell\\' is when I\\'m confused about who is really the lead character, or \\'hero\\' if you will, but it\\'s quite silly to talk about heroes since it\\'s (supposedly) a comedy.James Burrows had said in an interview once, that it\\'s very easy to tell if a comedy is well written - or if it works or not: don\\'t look at the screen, only listen to the dialogue, as if it was a radio play. It has to work, even then. And damn it, it\\'s true: try it, with \"Friends\", \"Cheers\", \"That 70\\'s Show\", I could go on. It works.

Not for any other reason than the following. 1. Why would you want to watch and waste you time with this show? 2. There must be something else on? 3. ABC have produced much better shows, why did they think this would be a hit?The short review.In a nation that put a man on the moon why can\\'t we learn how to make a funny show without saying that it is funny when it\\'s not. For example Family Guy = Funny (not to be biased but it\\'s not for everyone) The Golden Girls = Funny Roseanne = Funny 3rd Rock from the Sun = Funny Home Improvement = Funny Sitcoms aren\\'t funny unless they can be laughed at without a canned laugh track.The following above are just examples and not funny for everyone but are widely viewed and repeated. Happy Endings will probably not be repeated Thank God< Includes all beliefs but we\\'re One nation, let\\'s laugh at something funny together for once! It\\'s simple as ABC.',\n",

There is absolutely no wit or thought behind the writing, I literally wanted to scratch my eyes out it is that bad. Please stop making this show and showing me commercials, even those brief looks into what is coming up on the show is too hard for me to stomach watching. So tired of comedy shows like this that basically come up with the cheesiest jokes and actors they can find.

He owns the role. But he's gay, and that really limits his story line. The whole show already has TOO much of a gay feel. =0 Damon Wayan Jr. is awesome.

If you want laughs, this is where to go.I\\'ve read all the reviews here and people have been rating it poorly due to a weak pilot (I\\'ll admit it was weak), cliché characters (they are) and lack of story arc/character development.This is a comedy, not a light drama. I watch it to laugh, not to see characters develop and romances blossom. This show is similar to How I Met Your Mother\\'s earlier seasons, how it should\\'ve been before it became a lame love story. In some ways, it is similar to Seinfeld (also no character development) or It\\'s Always Sunny in Philadelphia (also no character development) - they\\'re shows to watch and laugh. Not for light dramas, cute events and \"aww\" moments.Every episode is a throwaway episode in that it can be watched in any order, the story is irrelevant in the big picture and it\\'s just a mechanism for delivering laughs.Ultimately, it\\'s a comedy, it sets itself out to be a comedy, says it\\'s a comedy and it does a great job at making people laugh. Rating it poorly for not having enough drama or character development is missing the point. It\\'s supposed to make you laugh, not cheer you up.The jokes are really funny. They are witty, sometimes word-based and sometimes situational, there\\'s flashbacks (Family Guy style), camera tricks, observational, references to other films and more. There is very little slapstick, people tripping, falling and so on.It\\'s not for everyone. If you want slapstick, drama and \"aww\" moments - you\\'ve come to the wrong place.

They apparently don't have a medical ethicist either. Every time they get to the crossroads of a moral dilemma, they take the wrong turn.In case nobody told them, you can't cross-match and do heart surgery with ER docs in the O.R. If an ER doc went to the O.R. he'd be laughed out of the room. Oh, writers for this series here's a clue: resuscitated people usually stay on a ventilator for a while and have IV's and stuff. People that sick, look, well, that sick. There is no social worker on the team, I guess that's a blessing as whatever stereotype of us exists would be through the roof. But they do have a full-time psychiatrist, ON THE NIGHT SHIFT! It was rare to ever see a psychiatrist in the ER let alone have one live there. Oh yeah. If we did have one I doubt she'd be boinking the narcissistic ER doc in the store room.I could go on and on but won't. Check it out for yourself.\",\n",

Drama and coolness abounds but glaring falsity in treating patients must not be twisted. wrong wrong wrong. At least HouseMD and Greys anatomy do not distort the medical procedures (sterility etc). They need a medical adviser to make this better. The first episode with the doctor doing auto transfusion without filtering is again a misnomer with what we really do.

Random slow motion scenes, ridiculous explanations for what caused the patients trauma, way over dramatized ER power struggles out of no where, wierd sexual tension, the stereotypes are perfect and extremely unrealistic, problems are solved out of no where throught an episode, and relationship paralyzing issues over the most random things.

And if you tire of the hospital surroundings, you can enjoy the same ridiculous plots that take place in Syria. The stories are all embarrassing and beyond belief and the acting is worse. Case in point is Scott Wolf. I am not too familiar with him, but I know he's been around for decades. If all his work is similar to the character he portrays here, it is a mystery to me how he continues to get acting jobs. His grimaces, bug eyes, and gestures are laughable. He treats every line like he is reciting Shakespeare. When he's on camera I just cringe! The only mystery bigger than how he gets acting jobs is why so many people think this is a good show.\",\n",

       "  'I have to start off by saying that I am not usually a fan of medical drama shows. I was never interested in ER, Grey\\'s Anatomy, Scrubs, or any of the other shows of this kind. This one, however, I like.I first watched the show because it stars Eoin Macken. I loved his light-hearted, somewhat goofy portrayal of Sir Gawain in the BBC show \"Merlin\", so I thought I\\'d see what he could do with this role. I\\'m very impressed with his work on this show, which seems to improve with every episode. His breakdown scene after his friend Topher is shot,triggering overpowering flashbacks to his time at war, is heart-breaking. The fact that he may be the most perfectly gorgeous man who ever lived is just a bonus.The show centres around a group of army doctors who now work on the night shift at a hospital in San Antonio. Macken plays T.C. Callahan, a doctor who is suffering from PTSD, though it is never specifically stated. The cast is lively and interesting. It includes Callahan\\'s ex- girlfriend, Jordan, as the acting chief of staff for the night shift, and a secretly gay army doctor who does MMA fighting on the side. There are also two interns, one who is capable, cool, fun, and fits right in, and the other who is \"book smart\" but naive. There is a hospital administrator who seems like a real stick in the mud, a psychiatrist who is having a sexual fling with T.C., and Jordan\\'s current boyfriend who joins the hospital as a trauma surgeon.With all of these colourful characters, there are endless story lines. There are always sub-plots alongside the main action, and everything blends together seamlessly. I have to admit that I found the first episode clumsy, as there was limited time to introduce so many characters, but after that, the show really took off.The action in each episode is non-stop. Being army doctors, these guys often fly out to do triage at a chemical explosion, or airlift a shooting victim from a remote hunting accident. Do I think this is a realistic portrayal of an average doctor\\'s shift at work? No. Is it dramatic, exciting, fast-paced, and fun? Hell, yeah.Although the plot changes each episode, it always furthers the personal story line of the characters. Each of them faces insecurity, doubt, jealousy, fear, joy, victory, and loneliness. There is a strong emphasis on camaraderie, sticking together through thick and thin, and helping each other. There is the occasional make-out session in a storage closet, pranks played on their new intern, and even a male nurse helping the boss write a dating site profile, all of which lighten the mood from time to time.Sometimes the patients die on this show. Sometimes the doctors make mistakes or have a melt down. It just adds to the drama, as outcomes are unpredictable. This is the kind of show that you allow yourself to enter, rather than sit back and observe. While it\\'s not demanding to watch, it is intense most of the time. I\\'ve shed a tear in many episodes.',\n",

Just because what unfolds during \"The Night Shift\" may not follow protocol of an actual E.R. that doesn\\'t mean it should take away from the show,IT\\'S A SHOW FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES. If you don\\'t find this entertaining go stare at a rock. You also have to realize, this show brought plenty of people work for an extended amount of time.

There are a couple of good actors in this show who should be doing better work. Wonder sometimes whether they really read the script or they get talked into things.

The afore mentioned gay couple try to adopt a kid when the real dad turns up out of the blue with about 5 mins screen, of course wanting to stop them and by the end of one episode this is all resolved and they take there daughter home.

I have been a loyal fan of \"The Night Shift,\" but in the fourth season, the series really lost touch with its roots. The fourth season started out just okay, but by their fourth episode, it started going downhill. The show seemed it faced a bit of an identity crisis, as it couldn\\'t decide whether or not it was military medicine or work back at home at Texas San Antonio night shift. I think the series peaked in its third season. Season three was near perfect, but the show\\'s fourth season had too much going on (as I said, come the fourth episode and that point on). \"The Night Shift\" always had the issue of balancing military-based stories and work at S.A.M., but it became much more obvious in the show\\'s fourth season. I think part of it might have been sending T.C. back to Syria, while also introducing the new nurse (played by Mark Consuelos), while also following T.C.\\'s new love interest of the year (cue the eye roll). It got to be too much. If the series stayed in touch with it roots through season four and then got cancelled, I\\'d be upset; however, that just wasn\\'t the case.

The lens flare, the cursing, making the Romulans this honorable people - stolen from the Klingons - making the federation a bitter alliance who turn their back on the Romulans. Picard is the only one left with a conscience? Ridiculous. As for bringing back Picard, why is CBS so afraid to do something truly new? An entire new cast.

In fact they diminished him so much that it is almost insulting and they keep creating opportunities to remind us that he is too old for this. This I find weird, detrimental to the show and completely unnecessary.4 episodes of what amounts to a setup and the season has 10. They surely took their time.

They are all in as a part of some deal, but what we really crave in drama is love, compassion, sacrifice and selflessness. Discovery injected these virtues into Star Trek correctly and artfully. Picard so far failed completely at this and created an emotional void that only amplifies other problems.The Federation resembles the Roman empire just before the collapse. They are infiltrated and run by all kinds of agenda with no real structure, mechanism -- and the will really -- to self-correct.

While it may be true that sweating was not a legal option in the early days of broadcast TV, Star Trek fans did come to understand it as a feature of the imagined better humanity, as symbolic as it is. They should have known this. Discovery used it sparingly and smartly. They knew the risks and they packaged it masterfully. This now is in your face -- \"because I can,\" probably even hoping to create controversy and social media discussion.The sense of awe and wonder is gone. Boundaries are not being pushed, human spirit is not being tested and challenged.

       " ['Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is one of the best and most underrated shows on TV. It stars Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, a tough-as-nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show. He has another side, a vicious side, that Criminal Intent\\'s Robert Goren (Vincent D\\'Onofrio) lacks. I\\'m very pleased that he\\'s been nominated for an Emmy. Mariska Hargitay won an Emmy for her performance as Olivia Benson, another fantastic detective. Benson has more edge than CI\\'s Alex Eames (Kathrine Erbe), but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects. Her life is put in danger at least twice a season, yet she continues to be strong. Next is the sarcastic detective Jon Munch, played by the excellent comedian Richard Belzer. Munch may seem annoying at times, but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent, and he plays the \"good cop, bad cop\" role very well. The final detective is Finn Tutuola, played by former rapper Ice-T. Ice-T plays the character reasonably well, but I think we\\'d all like to see a meaner side of him. He was very good in the episodes entitled \"Rage,\" and \"Rooftop\". They are led by Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek, and Cragen is as good a captain as any, as Florek reprises his role he held on \"Law & Order\" for a few years. Adam Beach recently joined the show, bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost \\'surfer dude\\' approach to detective work. The ADA now is Casey Novak, played by Diane Neal, who could be better, but she gets the job done. She\\'s been better of late, and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show. Her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was great also. The team is also aided by an FBI psychiatrist, George Huang (BD Wong), who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person, witness or suspect. His best performance was in the episode called \"Coerced.\" The members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes (rape, rape-homicide) and child based crimes (school shootings, child abuse, child molestation). The show has had extraordinary guest stars, from evil (Johnny Messner, Reg Flowers, Asio Highsmith, Jeff Kober) to touching (Leland Orser, Jerry Lewis) to lost (Brittany Snow) to famous and legendary actors (Jerry Lewis, Dean Cain, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Matthew Modine, Alfred Molina, Cynthia Nixon, John Ritter). This is a truly great show that not only shows the line of work in this graphic department, but shows the emotional stress a detective goes through. 10/10',\n",
       "  \"I have never one been that big of a fan of the original Law & Order. I would watch it for time to time and it was an alright show but never really had anything jump out at me to make it one of my can't miss shows. Then this show came on. I watched this show when it premiered back in 1999 and was impressed from the get go. Sure it followed the basic premise of it's original cousin but was much more loose on it's format and execution. Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson. The whole cast as a whole is magnificent. Now I know a lot of people will disagree with me that this show is in no way better than the original but for me it is. It has given me something that the original never did.\",\n",
       "  \"This used to be my favorite of the L&O franchise, until Stabler left. The last several seasons have done nothing but shamelessly pander to a political agenda, rather than focus on engaging plots, as they once did. It's regrettable that this show has become such a disappointment. It feels like I'm watching a sinking ship.\",\n",
       "  \"When I am communicating with other people interested in crime series it is remarkable how many people seem to watch either CSI or CSI: Miami or both. Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.The thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.Also all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).The reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. 9 out of 10\",\n",

The show has a very easy going nature despite the hardness of the cast that works well and acted beautifully.  It gives a real look at society's imperfections and discriminatory ideologies.

Munch was a great character on Homicide. They don\\'t write to either his character or the actor\\'s capabilities at all.Are these cops supposed to be NYPD cops?! *NEW YORK?* Playing social worker? No. New York cops solve crimes, they don\\'t play social worker. Victims are chumps, perps are prey.

Maybe the producers or whomever are trying to set a record for the length of the series, but there is little other reason for this show to continue. The exit of vital characters like Ziva & DiNozzo has created a downward slide into mis-casting key roles and creating dubious plots. The one bright spot in casting is Reeves, the MI6 transplant - both the actor and the character bring a breath of fresh air to the otherwise dowdy team. The loss of Vance's wife and Ziva's father was a preposterous plot twist. The addition of Quinn and Torres to fill the gaps in the NCIS team is weak and failing. Quinn has nothing to do and Torres doesn't belong there. Neither character is interesting nor entertaining in any way. Maybe, like Reeves, the producers should have considered another foreign import, French or Swedish?, to add some dimension. Bishop is marginally effective as an analyst, but is not believable as a field agent. It would have been better to keep her married and have her be the nerdy info bank who gathers and sorts backgrounds & personality profiles, even if it were a smaller role. That kind of role would be a fair replacement for the departing Abby, and Bishop's tricky relationship with her NSA lawyer-husband would have brought new fodder to episodes. And why do we have to be subjected to Jimmy Palmer's buffoonery in every episode, said buffoon scenes becoming longer with each passing season?

Also, the writing has taken a decided turn for the worse - the character's parts are all over the place, and it seems they have no idea what they are doing with Jimmy Palmer this season. The show used to be balanced, told a good story, and treated all of the characters well.

       "  \"*SPOILERS NCIS* The NCIS (Navy Criminal Investigative Service) is a service that investigates on any kind of crime, from barroom brawls to international terrorism, that involves men and women from the Navy or Marine Corps.The team is formed by: Leroy Jethro Gibbs (the second B stays for Bastard) (Mark Harmon), the moody, intuitive head investigator; he likes his coffee very strong, his women with red hair, and his investigations thorough. It is rare to get a compliment for him; when you get one, don't ask why. He is very loyal, and actually cares for his team, but has problems with women (evidence of this being three failed weddings). Anthony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Gibbs' 2IC; a smartmouth, player to the soul and proud of it, who masks his quick mind and powerful intuition with a happy-go-lucky (and sometimes obnoxious) attitude. Sometimes he can behave in quite the juvenile way, and when he is, a good headslap by Gibbs will help him put things straight (this two have also what could possibly be the strongest homosexual subtext - more of an almost-text - in TV History). He enjoys to torment someone, usually the newest element of the team. Dearly departed Special Agent Kate Todd (more later) and Special Agent Tim McGee (more later) have suffered the brunt of that in various occasions. Comes from money, but doesn't get an allowance because if he did, he wouldn't work, and it seems there is bad blood between him and his family. He has a deep love of movies and TV Shows (one of his favorites is 'Ozzy And Harriet'), and referred to movie-acquired knowledge various times.Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander), killed in the Season 2 Finale, who came from Secret Service, and made a point of bringing it up whenever the occasion presented itself, and came off as quite the uptight girl; all in all, the weakest character in the show, though her witty 'Hepburn-Tracy' rapid-fire dialogues with DiNozzo were great, and she had with him the strongest hetero almost-text this side of Gil Grissom and Catherine Willows.Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) a perky Goth (not as oxymorous as it sounds) who has an imprecise number of tattoos on her body and is the greatest at her job. She loves to hear techno or hard rock music (like Android Lust) played at a very loud volume while working. She is the only person in the team Gibbs actually shows affection for, and she is currently dating Special Agent Tim McGee (more later).Tim McGee (Sean Murray), who joined the team in the second season after making various guest-appearances throughout the first season. Tim is a computer whiz, but is at a loss when it comes to social life; has gotten a tattoo on his butt to impress Sciuto - and it worked. Has been mercilessly teased by DiNozzo when he first joined the team, getting the absolutely-not-flattering nickname 'Probie' ('Pivello' ('Greenhorn') in the Italian Version). He has proved his valor, though, time and time again.And last but not least, Donald 'Ducky' Mallard (David McCallum), the ME, who has two curious habits; one, to talk to the corpses he is going to autopsy, and the other, to go off on tales that are very loosely related to the case in question. He likes the music Abby plays, but not distorted by speakers, lives with his mother, who, wearing only Chanel N°5 when she goes to bed, hosts very awkward slumber parties and has various dogs, he is the one who has worked the longest with Gibbs and looked like 'Ilya Kuryakin' when he was younger.This is the team (I'm not talking about Ziva and Madame Director because I have yet to see Season 3), and my suggestion is to watch them in action, every Tuesday, 8/7 central, on CBS.You won't be disappointed.NCIS: 9/10.\",\n",

Those moments were moving because they felt real and because they involved characters we cared about.The past couple of years have upturned almost all of that. Almost all the core personalities are gone. Those still there (Gibbs, McGee, and--occasionally--Ducky) have been emasculated to the point where you begin wondering if McGee and Jimmy are going to start making out during one of their heart-to-hearts. Gibbs is becoming more of a senile grandpa with each episode. Other characters have come and gone: the gorgeous Jennifer Esposito, the black English dude, McGee's disabled wife... As for the shrink (Jack) and the new Abby (a.k.a. a female Steve Urkel), the less said the better. Torres and Bishop are okay but they're never going to fill the shoes of Ziva David and Anthony DiNozzo. I think the only character worth his salt anymore is Director Vance.Then there's the storylines and plots. The show has taken on a distinctly politically-correct tone. Seasons 16 has so far managed to dredge up racism form the 1960s as well as feature sermonizing about the environment... - and that's just two episodes! It's now a hybrid of the Gilmore Girls, Lethal Weapon, and Dr. Phil.It pains me to say it but this show is well past its sell-by date. It's time to put it out of its misery.

It was great to bring back Ziva this season as an attempt to keep us interested, but it's a little too late because the damage has already been done the last few seasons. I can no longer watch without cringing every time Bishop & Kasie are on the screen because they just don't belong on this show. So many other loyal fans have said the same things & it amazes me they haven't replaced these horrible characters yet, but maybe the plan is to end the show, so they figure why bother writing in better characters. Anyway, I just want to say how much I truly enjoyed every season up to 13. I put up with most of season 14 only because I love Jennifer Esposito & wanted to see where that was going, but the minute they forced that out of nowhere relationship Bishop had onto us & then had her go all crazy & murder that guy it made me sick to my stomach to watch after that. I actually forced myself to keep watching just because I kept thinking things would change & that maybe Bishop would get fired for what she did or get demoted, since that's what it seemed was going to happen, except nothing happened. I guess the writers just gave up trying after that. I finally stopped watching it weekly after Kasie joined the team, though because she's the absolute worst fit of any character that's ever been on the show & I just couldn't stomach watching it after that. Last month I went back to try & catch up before this new season started by trying to skip through the parts when she came on & parts where it was just Bishop, too, but it's just not worth the trouble, so I am officially done watching for good now.

Probably they decided to cancel the original show and are preparing the way for a new show \"Arrow sons 2\" in the future. I am only watching it because i am curious how they will end it.',\n",
       "  'I used to love this show. When it began, the mere athleticism of Stephen Amell used to give me goosebumps and I would have rated it an 8, even 9. But with the passing of time (I think somewhere around Season 4), the quality of writing started dropping. Actors can do only so much (and they do give their best every time) with this kind of material. Some characters have become sort of hangers on and should be put out of their misery.I sure hope things pick up in Season 7.',\n",
       "  'This was one of the best TV shows you watch for comic book genre, It started of great well lit up scenes with loads of action, suspense and a good story-line, suddenly all of that was thrown out and made a weak series in which the main character reveals himself all the time and the action is terrible to watch, no suspense, no general direction of the character, in almost every episode its the same dialogue \"Oliver if you want them to trust you, you should let them know who you are, and Oliver takes of his eye piece and says \"I am the Green Arrow\" L.O.L What Dafuq.The show is just going down hill, specially that now the main character is now Felicity (sleeps with all the Billionaires and take their fortune and keeps them under her payroll) worst character, Thea Queen 2nd billionaire famous line \"I am out\". Just keep the group small and the action hardcore like 1st season, identity reveal yeah stop that, let the character start killing again, and please don\\'t bring dead people back to make their own show.Season 1 - Great. Season 2 - Just OK. Season 3 - What is happening.Season 4 - Why are you killing the show. Season 5 - I give up, cant watch anymore. Season 6 - Stopped watching.',\n",
       "  \"This show started off great from season 1, onto season 2, then it began to slow down a bit in season 3 and 4, but it picks up again with action in season 5. There are many story line build ups, and great flashbacks, and it also compliments with the action and fight scenes. One major critic of the show will be how the writers will often attempt to put in too many love sequences in a super hero show, another will be how the story doesn't follow up as well with the Green Arrow comics. If the show sticks to its action first and love story later, it will stay more consistent to what fans would love to see, and this will keep the show alive for a longer number of seasons. The best part of this show is that it provides its viewers with crossover episodes, and team ups with other super hero shows such as the Flash. These crossover episodes provides more action and delivers a comic book genre type of team up for fans or even non comic book fans to enjoy. On a side note, season 2 of this show is by far the best TV show season I have ever watched. Even if you do not have time watching this show, just watch season 2, you won't regret it.\",\n",

It has failed the fans making the Arrow a weak, troublesome individual that really anybody can defeat. Start making him more astute, more strong, and wiser than his enemies. The series is plagued with Oliver's failures to succeed. You have a great potential for the series do not waste it on stupid writing. We want to see a strong Arrow not a weak one defeated by everybody. Make him a winner again.\",\n",

Arrow is a darn good show, and the first Pilot episode is very strong and leaves little confusion behind this vigilante's origins. I felt that the main actor properly conveys a somber and mature attitude in contrast to the description we receive of him as a partying playboy before the shipwreck. The action is intense and not over the top or completely unbelievable. What we're presented with is a young man whose 5 years spent on an island have shaped him up into an agile warrior tasked with cleaning up his city from corruption. I can't wait to see what lies in store through future episodes, and I certainly hope this show delivers the goods. So far, I believe we're in store for some quality television this fall.\",\n",
       "  \"I have seen all 23 episodes of Arrow, and honestly I'm pretty impressed. I believe this is inspired by Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, but I don't think that it's a ripoff. For me, the show is never boring. It is like the combination between teen drama and the Dark Knight trilogy. Speaking of realism, this show is not realistic at all. Oliver with Diggle and Felicity seem to have any solution to every kind of problems, well it doesn't matter at all since this is a comic book adaptation. As much as I love this show, I still think the show is so flawed. The cast aren't that good, well they are okay. Sometimes what really bothers me is the dialogs, it is so f-in cliché. The dialog is so fake that's filled with cheesy words that we'd NEVER say in real life. What I like most about the show are the action and the plot. The plot is very good, the crimes never seem to end, and I loved every episode in the series.As much as how flawed the show is, it's pretty darn entertaining. It's obviously not Breaking Bad or game of Thrones, but it's one of the most entertaining shows in TV today.!\",\n",
       "  'Let\\'s take a moment of mourning for the TV plot arcs of yore. Back when shows prioritized the characterizations above the action and, if indeed there was action, it took place precisely in the last 7 minutes of the episode, and was all done with before the close, giving the characters a chance to make light comic banter, close down the storyline, and give the audience a chance to go to the toilet. How many TV shows followed that formula I cannot say, but the number was in the 100s. Now all that has changed. You can now have action many times in the body of a show, it is permitted, even encouraged. And you have action even before the characterizations are fully developed. All this is positive evolution I think. But here the catch. There are no more \"closed\" story-lines. In the multi-band, multi-channel, multi-device electronic age, where viewers tend to have attention span of a hummingbird, nighttime TV has astonishingly borrowed the Rule Book of daytime soap operas and, lo!, plots never actually resolve, they just become more complex. ARROW is one of the best exponents of the new type of comic-book-derived drama, arguably as good as or even better than SMALLVILLE (which was, thematically, all over the map). Amell is great. He has a whispery kind of delivery which oddly makes what he says that much more interesting. The supporting cast is great. In fact the only thing that prevented me from giving this a \"10\" are the flashbacks. They are terrible. They are like some silent Hell the viewers must go through to get back to the actual episodes. It is almost as if the lead writer, as a small child, was locked in a closet with a DVD looping KUNG FU, and grew up to believe that you cannot advance 10 minutes of plot in the present, without 2 minutes of flashback to fortify it.',\n",
       "  \"(This review is written after having seen episodes 1-6 only) Who the hell decided to give the green light for this series in this state? Honestly, the people who made this must have never read a comic book in their lives.First off, let's get the good things out of the way: the plot is very promising and so far it's the only thing that keeps me going, and the cinematography/effects are not bad, but they could use a little polish here and there, especially the choreography of some fight scenes. (2 stars from here) Now what is wrong with this series? They failed on every level to deliver us a show about a superhero. They took the idea of the Green Arrow and crapped all over it.Firstly, the Green Arrow is supposed to be an incredibly stoic and cynical character when he is monologuing, with a witty tongue reserved for his foes. Someone who used to be a very naive young man once, but who was slapped in the face with the realization that the society around him is rotten to the core. So he sets off in a crusade to even the balance between the poor and the rich and bring some justice to his corner of the world with only his excellent archery skills as a weapon, as a modern-day Robin Hood. Now, the background story the series shows about him being stranded on the island shows this very good. However, his monologues are not as thought-provoking, philosophizing or caustically cynical as they appear in the comic books. I will give the actor though another star because after watching the first couple episodes, he is honestly trying to improve his character and deliver his poorly-written lines in an Arrow-like manner. Kudos to you sir for actually caring! Secondly, alas the efforts of one person are overshadowed by the failures of the rest of the acting crew. Plastic dolls posing in shop windows have better acting skills than this lot. First and foremost is the annoying ex-girlfriend Laurel whatever-her-name who delivers her lines in the most crude way possible. I can see her thinking trying to remember what she's supposed to say or what emotion to show in her face. It's like watching a baboon school play. The writing of her character doesn't help either. We are supposed to accept that AFTER 5 YEARS she is still in love with the guy who cheated on her WITH HER FRIGGIN SISTER, and who is responsible for her death? And how about his mother that apparently killed her husband, but threatens to raise hell if a hair of one of her family is even touched.And then we come to the third and most crucial failing of this series. This is supposed to be a series about a superhero. I don't care at all about the sex life of his ex-girlfriend, I don't care about the sister's drinking problem, I don't care about the social life of anyone. Partly, because they fail as characters, but mostly because this is a series about a SUPERHERO. This isn't the Days of Our Lives, or Sex & The City. I'm not expecting to watch romantic crap about women on their period. I'm expecting to watch a superhero kick ass, bring justice to the wicked and perform some general pwnage. Don't get me wrong, I can understand showing how his actions to hide his alter ego affect those around him and how in turn he is affected himself, I like to see some inner conflict in my super heroes. What I don't like is the Green Arrow being a supporting actor in his own series. An average episode goes about 40 minutes and 30 of those are spent showing us uninteresting flirting between his friends and family, then the Green Arrow steps in the room and says he has to go (to fight bad guys) but instead of following him, we are stuck for another 4-5 minutes to witness the constant crying of his friends and family of how he never spends time with them.I DON'T CARE!!!! Seriously, imagine watching a series about Batman, that all it does is show Catwoman talk to her girlfriends about how she is in love with a really cute guy called Clark Kent (yes Clark Kent, that's how messed up Arrow is).A terrible effort and an outright insult, don't waste your time, at least for now.It's still pretty early in the production (only 6 episodes so far) and as I said the plot seems interesting. Perhaps the CW network will come around to realizing how much more they could do with this series and improve it later on in the season. One can only hope.\",\n",
       "  'Season 3 was mediocre, but season 4 has a huge drop in quality (shoutout to Marc \"Franchise Slaughterer\" Guggenheim). If you are a fan of the series, do yourself a favor and stop watching. The Flash is really hitting it\\'s stride if you\\'re desperate for CW superhero shows. This season of Arrow is just a crudely stitched together collection of tumblr fanfics. The characters have lost any real personality, and just serve to move the plot forward (this season is plagued by writers using half- baked concepts to push the \"plot\" forward by brute force). They frequently make decisions that defy any form of logic as well as any character traits of note. Any development that the characters have made in the past seasons has just disappeared, seemingly because they oppose Guggenheim\\'s Mary Sue couple. Also it would be a misconception to think that the villain is the basis of any overarching plot. He\\'s just a side note to said couple. Really this season seems to lack any direction whatsoever. It\\'s like the writers are giving up on trying to provide any cohesive story. And to make it worse, while they could look back to some of the source material for some good ideas, they spit in its face in favor of their own rambling mess.As a side-note, I feel that the length of this show has been a huge detractor from the start. Even in it\\'s glory days, the seasons probably could have been trimmed in half or lower and tell the same story. A lot of the time on this show is wasted on silly stuff, and could it could be a huge improvement to trim down the story to something more concise and save more for the effects budget. But honestly, is nobody in the studio checking up on them? Was this really looked at and approved by real people in the entertainment business? It boggles my mind that this could make it to air on such a well known show. The CW\\'s superhero shows have always been aimed at a more \"teeny\" audience, but at the levels that Guggenheim has taken it to, it seems like he would be better off writing those fanfics and letting someone with moderate respect for the story\\'s integrity take over. I love the actors in this and wish them the best, but the only hope I can see for this show is to retcon this season and get a fresh team of writers because this may be the biggest train wreck I have ever witnessed make the air.',\n",

It's stupid, inconsistent, hypocritical, ridiculous, and most of the acting is terrible.It's a pity because the underlying story with the mother and her associates is the shows only redemption. You just have to sit through the agony of the rest of the show to get this. Maybe they should save us all the heartache and just tell us what happens with that story line.\",\n",
       "  'OK, just seen the first episode and I think it was amazing. I am not the biggest fan of comics or very knowledgeable about Green Arrow in general, so I feel I can be very objective in reviewing this show like I would any regular one, without fan-love ideas or huge expectations. The characters seem very believable so far, few minor doubts here and there but nothing crucial; acting also up to part. Story is realistic, without that fantastical loop holes that comic adaptations usually have (was told Green Arrow was like that in comics too, so I respect the decision to stay with that). CGI was decent, compliments to stunt collection and fighting choreography (well done, sir, well done), and quite good screenplay for this episode. The makers opened quite a few questions, made room for many ways show can stream to; I can say without a doubt, that this show is one of the surprises of this fall and I can only hope that the whole season lives up to this great pilot.',\n",
       "  \"I'm not sure why Arrow has an 8.1 rating, pretty high for an overly boring, almost laughable show.First of all, why does Oliver always seem to feel the need to have sex with every woman he encounters? Second, why does everyone come back from the dead? And third, why does every villain they come across somehow related to the island Oliver was stranded in for five years?Don't get me wrong. I do like the concept. I'm sure this would have been an amazing show if the script, or the plot, or the actors weren't so horrible. I find myself always laughing at the dumb things the characters say/do. The plot doesn't make sense at all, there's nothing remotely interesting or not ridiculous in it. And the characters are just as laughable. How did they cast these actors exactly? Was there even an audition or were they just going for the prettiest faces that came their way?This used to be a good show, the first few episodes were good, that is. Somehow, it took a turn for the absolute worst.\",\n",
       "  \"Like many others here. I thoroughly enjoyed season 1, 2 and 3 was alright. 4 was where it really went down hill with poor plot and acting which overall lost the more gritty feel to arrow. Season 5 however really brought it back for me with an amazing villain and interesting plotline. Despite this I dropped out midway season 6 as again the story became sloppy, repetitive and uninteresting which is a real shame for a show that really does have it's high points. Highly recommend just watching through to the end of season 5 and leaving it there. Probably just watch a season recap or something on season 4 as its really not worth the watch.\",\n",
       "  \"I've watched all 7 seasons of arrow, and its been quite the journey, but the quality has been dropping with each new season. I can no longer justify spending my time watching this show, as it just isn't good anymore. Nothing about story is interesting, no good villains, plots and schemes. Everything is predictable.\",\n",
       "  '...this show is almost indescribably bad. It makes me angry just to think about.Caveat: I don\\'t know a whole lot about Green Arrow. His name is Oliver Queen, he gained his skills while marooned on an island, he\\'s rich, and he is SO EASY to make fun of. But this isn\\'t an attack on the concept. I\\'ve seen sillier concepts work out to be much better shows.Arrow is one of those shows where wooden acting, poor directing, and writing about on par with the Twilight Saga come together to create one of the most offensive television experiences I have ever had. And I\\'ve seen Jersey Shore.Stephen Amell as the titular hero Green Arrow and Katie Cassidy as Laurel are particularly bad, with approximately one-and-a-half facial expressions between them and a penchant for removing themselves from the room as the standard method of showing anger. You could make a drinking game out of it, truly.The writing is staggeringly awful. However, when I say \"writing,\" I\\'m not speaking about the plot. That might yet unravel over time, but it\\'s too early to tell. What I mean is the actual words which come out of people\\'s mouths. There is a specific scene which comes to mind where Oliver and his best friend, Tommy, are seated at a table, discussing their friendship. Tommy reveals that he\\'s been sleeping with Laurel, and Oliver\\'s only reaction is, \"That\\'s okay, I forgive you.\" I closed my eyes for this scene and realized that I could not even tell who was saying what at certain points. They have no verbal mannerisms, and the \"funny\" best friend has no real sense of humor that I could discern. Plus, his jokes plain suck, but I guess that\\'s a minor point, all things considered. I should point out that, recently, a friend told me that Tommy Merlyn turns into Green Arrow\\'s nemesis, which means they of course have a lot in common and might seem like the same person at times. But that doesn\\'t really come across as purposeful on this show.The directing is maybe the worst offender, here, because a good director could turn cruddy actors and poor writing into something downright entertaining. Just look at Sam Raimi\\'s work on Spider-man 1 and 2. Instead, I find myself imagining David Barrett or John Dahl or any number of the other directors on this show, sitting there texting while scenes are happening. Maybe eating a sandwich or something. Not paying attention must be hungry work.I\\'m getting into a lot of detail, so I\\'m just going to cut this off and say that I should have seen it coming. Just look at the promo picture. Really consider it. That was the very first thing we were shown regarding this series. Ask yourself what that says about their priorities.'],\n",
       " [\"The universe of Star Trek has done something brilliant to keep alive.  The creators have imposed a story arch for all the series starting with DS9. Don't get me wrong.  TNG was what got me into Star Trek in the first place. It had vibrant characters, unique ideas, and was the building block for setting the stage for the other series and the later movies.  However, in all it's glory, it lacked something.  Continuity.  The longest the crew of the Enterprise D would have to deal with an immediate situation, was no more than 2 episodes.  No doubt things would reoccur, but it was seldom. Voyager, however, would have numerous back to back episodes dealing with something.  And that might even resurface somewhere down the line.\\nI can't understand what people dislike so much about this show.  They explored so much more than any of the others.  Not just in the unverse, but with the crew.  They all grew.  Some more than others, but you can't go 7 years and not show growth in a character.  And as with every other Star Trek, it was rough at first, but it gets so much better once the writers and the actors have about a year or two to get it right.I truely believe that if people give it a chance and don't jump on the bandwagon, they'd like it.  It's easy to say you don't like something if you've never really given it a chance.\",\n",

There's no reason to EVER get that worked up over a program!  I've never been able to understand why a person would watch an entire seven year series, hating it all the way.  Option: Turn the channel.  You've got nothing to lose.  It's not like in the theater where one might sit through a tepid movie because they paid admission.  Voyager was free.  Take it or leave it.Personally, I enjoyed the show.  I liked the plot, the cast, and most of the storylines.  I appreciated the mix of drama and action.  Voyager, in my opinion, was a very good program.  Had I not felt good about it... I would have turned it off.  Problem solved.Not every series is going to be a masterpiece.  Not everyone is going to like every show.  If it's your cup of tea, drink it.  If not, put the cup down.\",\n",
       "  \"I had to respond to someone who said this was the worst of the franchise. I happen to favor DS9, but Voyager has many great qualities including cast and unique plots. Captain Janeway was an excellent addition to the captains of Star Trek. Let us not forget the criticisms that James Kirk had during the beginnings of his work in Star Trek. The ensemble worked well together, slowly but surely over seven seasons and there were many truly memorable segments. Chakotay, Tuvok, Blana, Tom, 7 of 9, Kes, Harry, Neelix, the Doctor, at the end named Joe, each and every one developed into a character you liked each and every week, irrespective of the episode. They grew even better over time, although I wondered how Chakotay and the Captain never got together and on occasion how Blana and Tom did!and the final episode a two parter was truly a great ending to the show.There is no edge like there is in DS9, just questions on how they are going to get home, and it is the third of this group so it gets compared to ST:TNG sometimes unfavorably. But, just as the ensemble was great in each, so as it is in Voyager. If you take the time to watch the first season you will want to see each and every episode and feel badly when it all ends. Wanting more that is just not forthcoming.Criticize if you will, but the current Enterprise could take some notice of the great ensemble of the previous Star Trek's and the wonderful writing that kept many turning in week after week and continue in syndication.I just recently purchased the full seven seasons on DVD and saw it again after its television airing. The show is even better than when I first wrote about it. Each show stands alone with compelling story lines that are creative in their design and resolution. The franchise of Star Trek- from its inception in the 60's through Voyager should continue in some form other than conventions. There is a void for good stories, writing and ensembles.\",\n",
       "  \"Contrary to what many Trek nerds would have you believe, Voyager is not the worst Star Trek series, and is not at all a bad show. The acting is superior to that on the beloved The Next Generation (that comment alone will probably have people throwing their Spock ears at their monitors), and I think many of the stories were better. TNG stories always seemed to revolve around spacial anomalies and holodeck malfunctions, which became excruciatingly boring. I wasn't interested in seeing Picard dressed up like Sherlock Holmes and trying to solve a fake mystery, only to be trapped on the holodeck and have the safety mechanisms shut off. As many times as this happened, I would have shut the silly thing down and prohibited its use.Voyager was so great because it truly put its protagonists into a situation that they could not extricate themselves from. For the first time since the original 1960's series, Star Trek characters truly went where nobody had gone before, discovering new races and acquiring knowledge. And they couldn't call on the federation to save them.And no doctor has ever been as good in his role as Robert Picardo. That even includes DeForest Kelly, who was exceptional. Jennifer Lien was also outstanding as Kes, who was very much missed after her departure from the series.Voyager brought back a lot of the adventure that was inherent in the first Star Trek series, and was lost in TNG. Perhaps it didn't live up to its enormous potential, but it was still a very good series that is, unfortunately, far to often the target of hate by TNG purists and people who like to pick at microscopic details.\",\n",
       "  \"Here in The Netherlands, Star Trek Voyager was on the TV every 4 days of the week. I've never payed much attention to this since I am not the biggest fan of since-fiction and sorts of movies and series like it. One day, nothing was on and I decided to lower myself to the 'level' Star Trek was on. From that moment on, I didn't knew what I was saying before!I began watching it every day, until I discovered I dropped right there in to the middle of Season 4. Which was pretty bad for me. Since I had NO clue what so ever how they got to the Delta Quadrant, where in war with the Kazon and who 'Kes' was, I decided I just had to afford the \\x8099,99 euro 7parts DVD box. This box was kept in storage somewhere behind my schoolbooks, until I missed a couple of episodes because of my weekly and daily responsibilities. I decided to start all over again and watch the entire series without subtitles or synchronization. Pure all-American humor and language that is.From that moment on, I knew what was going on, and how they got where they were. Including what happened to them. I didn't gave up watching Star Trek Voyager on TV, since there were still subtitles included on TV. It simply drew me back in all over again! (which I didn't mind at all) My initial misgivings suddenly disappeared and I began to be a huge fan of the series. I used to stay up all night watching it and I still do! After watching every single episode more than 3 times. Since I haven't gotten into all the other series, Voyager still raised above my expectations and for sure it amazed my how 'modern' it was for that time of year.Therefor I want to conclude; everyone who is interested in SF, star traveling, interesting plot-twists and more, should definitely watch this series! I gave it a definite 9+.\",\n",

       "  'Voyager, though different in many ways than other Star Trek series, is nonetheless a great chapter in the Star Trek saga. The characters are well developed, and the unusual situation allows for a creative array of episodes.In the first few seasons, it is obvious that the actors (and directors) are still getting used to the characters they are trying to create. As such, the first season or two is a little chaotic, though there are underlying personal and situational themes. Regardless, the early season are most definitely enjoyable, and provide a good foundation for the seasons that follow.Once the show gets underway, however, the characters are given more shape and depth, and the acting/directing vastly improves. The shows focus on a variety of subjects - interpersonal relationships among the crew, individual moral and spiritual issues, scientific anomalies, and time travel, as well as many other things. Both new and previously used aliens appear in the series, so while there are unfamiliar species (such as the Kazon), there are also ties to the original Star Trek villains.I highly recommend seasons two and four - they stand out as two of the best.Star Trek: Voyager, with its unique cast of characters and unusual mission, is a new way to explore the \"final frontier\".',\n",

I used to watch The Next Gen after school and I loved the idea of going off to space to explore new worlds and meeting new peoples. But the one thing that bothered me about the series was all the constrictions that the Enterprise had to go through. There was several shows that had the Federation saying 'You can't do this, or that!' But with Star Trek Voyager you have a smaller ship with only a couple of dozen of people on board in a distant part of the galaxy who are trying to get home. Far away from their family, friends and superiors. The series does an great job at redefining several species and introduces new ones. The cast is great and is always fun to watch Robert Picardo as the Doctor because he gets me laughing all the time. The ship has plenty of interesting characters all growing throughout the series. The Doctor becomes more then just a hologram medical helper and becomes a real member of the ship. Captain Janeway becomes a strong confident captain. Tom Paris, a womanizing troublemaker buckles down with a former hot head, federation hating Klingon. So if you love space exploration then this is the series for you.\",\n",

He makes me laugh out loud so many times, I had to apologize to my roommate for my uncontrollable outburst. Voyager is my painkiller for breaking out the laughs.

It might be corny to some but Voyager is making a grand statement -- to EXPRESS as humanly possible -- the purest form of unrelentless expression of art -- without restraint -- of music, dreams and holo novels, etc. I have to say, Voyager is a very entertaining series. There are immense creativity into the moral conscience, and interpersonal development within each member of the crew. Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, writers of Voyager gave Picardo the freedom to express beyond anything you can imagined. He is more feeling and more emotional than most organics -- and boy, can he sing! I love the premise for doctor\\'s expansive, self growth, developing, and becoming a valuable member as part of \"the family\" decision in the final 2 episodes of Endgame; science fiction at its best! Toward the end, EMH actually disobey Captain\\'s order and make \"human\" mistakes. I believe the chemistry between the crew works well. Harry Kim and Tom Paris, Neelix and Tuvok <-- those two are actually quite funny. I love Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan. Finally, I\\'m SO GLAD they did not go with the original actress for Janeway-- have you seen the rare 1st episode footage?! -- thank God for Kate Mulgrew! She has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. Let me put it this way, Kate Mulgrew did more than I ever envision a female Captain could do -- even with a hint of feminine quality. Hard to believe but the chemistry balance was just right. Kate, what a GREAT job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy every episode, the creativity, of morals issues we face everyday, and the potential possibilities of our Cosmic expanse.',\n",
       "  \"Voyager started off on shaky ground, but gradually levelled off into a good scifi show. It took TNG forever to find its unique niche and identity, and so it is for Voyager. It can be compared to the original Star Trek, in its go-where-no-one-has-gone-before identity.Humor and drama, action and sometimes even horror are well-balanced in Voyager, the characters started off slightly odd but eventually became edgy but fast friends with each other. Even Neelix, the Talaxian who often looks as if he's wearing rejects from Quark's wardrobe, has become a far more palatable and even likable character.If Neelix can make me laugh, then Voyager has its niche. :)\",\n",
       "  \"This is yet another brilliant Star Trek series, this time the danger  fraught adventures of the Federation star ship Voyager. As a result of  the Caretaker's intervention, Voyager has been stranded in the  generally hostile Delta Quadrant, 75 years travel from Earth, with  little prospect of any return home in the foreseeable future and  initially not even any communication with the distant Federation. The  Voyager crew consists of some likewise stranded Maquis (including  Chakotay & B'Elanna) who have been forced to join forces with the  original Federation crew in a mutual struggle to survive and return  safely to the Alpha Quadrant.  Commanding Voyager is surely the Federation's most bold, determined,  decisive, and feisty captain. Kathryn Janeway is a no nonsense lady  who, given the risks inherent in this unexplored new quadrant, is  frequently obligated to arm the photon torpedoes first and seek  diplomacy later. Her stern voice commands 'Hail them!' when hostile  species threaten, generally followed by the even more terse and severe  call, 'Battlestations'. Captain Janeway, who is addicted to black  coffee, has left a fiancé back home on earth.  The Delta Quadrant really isn't a very friendly place. One of the first  adversaries encountered is the Kazon, a brutal race subdivided into  constantly warring factions. The Vidians have an unfortunate tendency  to steal organs from living victims in their attempts to counteract the  Phage, which has plagued their people for centuries. The Malon are the  quadrant's polluters, dumping their garbage of deadly theta radiation  wherever they can get away with doing so. The Hirogen are obsessed with  the hunt, the pursuit of prey, the kill, and the collection of  trophies. Species 8472 hails from fluidic space and boasts five  genders. Most deadly is the ongoing threat of the ubiquitous Borg with  their cubes, spheres, nasty Queen, and disquieting desire for  assimilation.  Janeway's calm, likable first officer, Chakotay, is a former Maquis of  Native American origin. He has a tendency to navel gaze about his  ancestors' spiritual beliefs. He & Janeway share a truly touching bond  of mutual respect, friendship, and dependency, unhindered by the threat  of romance... except once when stranded perhaps indefinitely alone  together on a planet, when some sparks fly between them!   Harry Kim is the innocent young operations officer, everyone's  favourite boy next door, homesick for his parents and unlucky in love.  The ship's ongoing romance is between Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres.  B'Elanna is the feisty, hot tempered, half Klingon Chief Engineer. Tom  is Voyager's cool, nonchalant, charming pilot / helmsman, who has a yen  for old movies, Captain Proton, rock & roll, fast cars and even faster  spacecraft. Midway through the series he designs a fancy new shuttle  craft, the Delta Flyer.  Tuvok and Neelix are polar opposites. Tuvok, the totally logical,  openly emotionless Vulcan tactical officer, has left a wife & family  back home on Vulcan. Needless to say, he experiences a pon farr during  Voyager's travels! Tuvok's leisure pursuits include meditating, playing  logic games such as kal-toh, and listening to Vulcan dirges. Neelix is  the super friendly, warm hearted, enthusiastic cook and morale officer,  a Talaxian who has lost his family as a result of a devastating weapon,  the metreon cascade, on his home planet. Tuvok appears to barely  tolerate Neelix, but underneath is a touching, unacknowledged  affection. One of the more intriguing episodes sees a transporter  glitch combine Tuvok & Neelix into one individual, Tuvix, with a truly  unique personality mixture of the two.  In my opinion, the only uninteresting crew member is Neelix's  girlfriend, the lovely Kess, despite her developing special powers.  Kess is an Ocampan, a Delta Quadrant race with a short life span, whose  females incubate their young in a sac on their back. Kess is replaced  mid way through the series by the totally compelling and endearing  Seven of Nine, a Borg of human origin, severed from the collective  during the fascinating two part episode, The Scorpion. The beautiful  blonde Seven struggles to adjust to her newfound individuality as she  punches up data in Astrometrics, ever efficient in her skin tight garb  and pausing only long enough to regenerate.   Perhaps the most lovable crew member is The Doctor, actually the  Emergency Medical Hologram, but with more personality than any of the  organic folk! He's a totally insufferable, arrogant, yet very appealing  character who has a brief love affair of his own with a Vidian doctor.  He also sings opera and has something of a crush on Seven, to whom he  gives dating lessons (definitely Voyager's funniest episode). There's  even a child aboard, the charming little half Ktarian Naomi Wildman,  who was born on Voyager. Neelix reads her bedtime stories, but later  she longs to become Captain's Assistant. Her role model is Seven with  whom she plays kadiscat.   New technologies introduced in the series include Voyager's bio-neural  gel packs. Needless to say, the crew frequently encounter false leads  that promise a quick trip home to the Alpha Quadrant. A number of their  adventures involve disruptions in the time line. The most compelling  time related episode is the two part Year of Hell, involving constant  attacks by the Krenim time ship with its devastating temporal weapon.  At the heart of the series is the crew's camaraderie in its assorted  struggles to return to the Alpha Quadrant. Their goal is challenging,  but it's the journey that counts. My sole complaint is the show's  occasional intrusion into the theological realm with the Klingon  Messiah, Klingon hell etc. Otherwise, it's a wonderful & unique science  fiction series with a stellar cast. Finally, my compliments to the late  Jerry Goldsmith for his amazing theme music. I call it the music of  longing to go home.\",\n",
       "  'As was true with Star Trek Deep Space Nine, as the Star Trek Voyager series progresses, the episodes keep getting better and better!! Seven of Nine\\'s quest to regain her humanity, and the Doctor\\'s similar \"voyage,\" although he\\'s not technically human, are captivating as their characters continue to develop over the course of the series. Their relationship is also a tantalizing aspect of the series. I\\'m half-way through season 6 now, and to date, I find \"Someone to Watch Over Me\" (Season 5, episode 22) to be the best episode of the series to date. This episode also includes some of the funniest lines in any Star Trek, ever. I know it\\'s been over 10 years since this series first aired, but I wish to offer my sincerest congratulations to the writers and creators of this wonderful series!',\n",
       "  'Voyager is the best Star Trek series yet, hands down. While that may be an opinionated statement, I reason this by pointing out several key parts of the show which make it more enjoyable than any other series. The cast, firstly, has a lot of diversity and characters such as Janeway, Seven of Nine and the Doctor are extremely engaging throughout their respective seasons. The concept of the ship being stranded thousands of light years away from Earth or Federation space is not simply an interesting basis in its own right, but betters the development of these characters. They are isolated in an unknown region of space with foreign enemies and perils, which forces the characters to grow and adapt. It creates a new level of camaraderie as the Voyager crew depend on their ingenuity, co-operation and resourcefulness to find a way home.While these new aliens and planets may seem off-putting to both newcomers and old fans of Star Trek, the show is grounded nicely by the Federation principles which Voyager upholds. Their journey home is seen also as a mission of exploration, and familiar issues- such as the classic moral dilemma or Prime Directive story- return in different circumstances. However well the writers stick to the tried and tested formula (which is not a bad thing), a whole new quadrant of the Milky Way allows plenty of scope, as mentioned, for new enemies. While the Kazon are quite possibly the least intriguing of these, the disease-decimated Vidiians, hunting driven Hirogen, unmatchable Species 8472 etc are all fascinating. Romulans, Cardassians, Ferengi etc make \"cameos\" too, while the Borg encounters have made Captain Janeway the stuff of legend.The main reason to watch Voyager is that it is enjoyable, just like most Star Trek and like all TV aims to be. It has the real feeling of exploration, revamped and revitalised from the older programmes. The real Star Trek atmosphere is caught up in the lonely but determined ship stuck in the Delta Quadrant, sticking to their guns through thick and thin.',\n",
       "  \"Voyager - 7 seasons on DVD. This is a must see. Backgrounds, stories, characters, are all first class. An excellent work of modern TV drama. Following entirely the Gene Roddenberry's vision, this show is indeed a prime derivative. It would be unfair to mention any name in particular. The integration of roles, stories and dialog is remarkable. If you ever liked a sci-fi film then these DVD boxes contain a treasure. From very important social issues, through galactic perils and humor, the crew of Voyager along with its creative team will take you really where no man has gone before. Packaging is robust and typical. All seasons contain extra material. Audio and Video take a 10 in 10. Enjoy the ride in the 4th Quadrant. This is an order.\",\n",
       "  'Voyager is over, at least for now.  We all know that no one really dies, or in this case ends, in the Star Trek universe. It has been a fun 7 years. Voyager as been an oasis in a wasteland of television.  It has provided the watcher adventure, romance, comedy, drama and social awareness.  There have been a few disappointing episodes, but that is true with almost every show. On the whole, I think that Voyager has lived up to the Star Trek name and furthered Mr. Roddenberry\\'s dreams.  I\\'ll miss Voyager and her crew.  But I would like to thank the \"powers that be\" for a happy ending.',\n",
       "  'To me, nothing can approach the goofy, paper mache rock flinging greatness of the original series. Voyager, however, is a close second due to the ever evolving character relationships and story lines that center around entire (fascinating) command staff rather than being \"The Starfleet captain show\" or occasional focus on one or two main characters. Speaking of Captain Janeway, i simply cannot understand how a few consider the character or the actress \"weak\". ST Series best to worst IMO- Star Trek, Voyager, Star Trek TNG, Enterprise, Star Trek TAS, Disappointment 9',\n",
       "  \"Voyager can be said to be a science fiction version of Homer's story of The Odyssey with Captain Janeway as a female version of Odysseus. The crew of Voyager face the same adventures that Odysseus and his crew did after the Trojan War. Many of the episodes reflect the myths of the of The Odyssey especially the one where the planet of women that capture men to drain them of life such as Ceres did to the crew in the novel.\",\n",
       "  \"Much like other Star Trek series' each episode is more-or-less self contained, in that it has little to no effect on future episodes as they're exploring other worlds or space phenomenon, but there is one constant, they're trying to get home. As good as The Original Series or Next Generation were, they never had any underlying storyline as Voyager does.\\nI like the point of choosing Voyager for the journey, it's a ship that can just about manage the long distance at a good speed (other lesser space-craft in the Star Trek universe would be too slow making thier journey seem unrealistic and virtually unattainable) and the brilliant crew work well together.But the best part of Voyager is that it shows that Star Trek is not JUST Enterprise (we have done three series' with Enterprise as the major space-craft so it's nice to see them move on, I recognise that Deep Space Nine had the namesake space station and the small craft Intrepid, and now there's Discovery with its namesake craft)I enjoyed every episode of Voyager and though the storyline was well made, especially in the latter, Seven of Nine, seasons with the Borg.\",\n",
       "  \"I have a particularly strong attachment to this show and can honestly say it is my favorite in the whole Star Trek universe. I started to watch it from day one all the way to the end even though it took a while for the series to fully realize its potential. The first 3 seasons were good but nowhere near as great as the show would become later yet I hung on, hopeful that something better would come along and then boom, Seven of Nine appeared.The show only started to become really wonderful when Jeri Ryan was added to the show with Scorpions at the end of the 3rd season as the cliffhanger for season 4. Somehow, I really connected with this particular character and from then on, they could do no wrong or at least, they could always count on my loyalty to watch. Sure the writing is uneven in places and some episodes are not as great as others but it's true for any series.I have to say that the number one reason why I connected so strongly with this series is this particular set of characters. Somehow, it all gelled so well and even though I have favorites of course like Seven, The Doctor and Janeway, they all had something interesting to add to the mix and the chemistry always worked for me, even in sub par episodes. But thankfully, even the lowest rated episodes have something interesting to offer.I was particularly satisfied with how the series ended, the perfect conclusion to one heck of a journey and I still miss it to this day even though I can always watch to my heart's content any time I feel like it. This is connected with a great time in my life and I will always remember if fondly.A strong 9 stars is well deserved and the 1 star is deducted from the perfect score only because the writing is sometimes not as strong as it should be, especially with episodes not connected to the Borg or Seven of Nine. But still, every single show has something to offer and this series remain one of the very best I had the pleasure of experiencing as it ran for 7 successful seasons and I could not recommend it enough.\",\n",
       "  \"OK, the last season was a disappointment, no arguments here. up until that point however, this was a pretty darn good show. season four was my personal favorite. with episodes like nemesis, year of hell and living witness, (the revisionist history point could have been used again)who could not like this show. it was episodes like those that made this show true, poignant star trek. Get the season four DVD! it is awesome as has the most of the most skillfully crafted written, directed, acted, shot) episodes of this show or Ds9.For the first two years, they couldn't seem to get the marquis thing out of their (the writers) head's, but for the most part this was OK. the episode where Paris' little act was revealed and Alliances more that made up for learning curve (Tuvoks boot camp) and parallax where Torres first became chief engineer; which actually was a necessarily rough episode, being the first one after the premiere. The characters developed gradually over time but each of them developed steadily and at their own pace; even Tuvok, who at first was so terribly stolid/stoic.things actually started to wane plot-wise around the 6th season. most were still watchable but they lacked drive and intensity. Muse, fury and blink of an eye (was that a 6th season?) were pretty great though. who determined that every star trek set in this century needed 7 seasons anyway? that is how disappointing season 7 feels to many people: it never should have happened. I can't believe (or can hardly believe) what they did to some of the main characters during that season. (thinking mainly of author author-like episodes here.) but everyone had ample amounts of episodes in the spotlight and most had ample time in episodes that were focused on others; here is what set voyager apart:everyone got significant time on-screen well, that's about it. save that Janeway did at times seem bi-polar and the whole thing about getting home (the restart button?) got pretty old eventually. that's one thing that set timeless apart: time-travel, good Kim episode, voyager didn't get home but ended up getting closer to home. the show had many individual episodes on all points on the rating scale. over all, 7 out of 10 points\",\n",
       "  \"Star Trek: Voyager is a great series to watch. The initial concept of the show is pretty simple: USS Voyager is taken to the delta quadrant against there will and are stranded there - leaving them no choice to but to embark on a long and dangerous journey home.The Voyager series brings in a lot of new and old ideas about the star trek universe. The new idea of having a holographic doctor and being able to send him on away-missions is a very complex and entertaining idea. The idea of two opposing factions banding together to work as one crew is new. However, some old ideas do still remain for example the unattractive uniforms, color designations, button sounds and the weakness of their ship.The cast is full of good actors. At first the characters were green and so was the acting, but by the second season the characters and acting seemed to flow much better. Captain Jane-way certainly looks and feels like a leader and her choices are often made by seeking advice from other crew members, but some of her decisions are startlingly dark and immoral. There were a lot of recurring minor roles for actors and they brought a unique feel to the show.One of the best things I like about this series is that it gets very technical, but is also dumbed-down enough to make sure the ordinary lay-man (like myself) can still understand what's going on. The addition of Seven of Nine was a great idea. Jeri Ryan brought in a great sex appeal and added further to the technical stand-points in the show. I fully enjoyed learning a lot about the Borg. It is one of the species I was most interested in.If you want to know about the Borg, this is the series to watch. Also, this series is very dark. At some points I had shed some tears. Rick Berman was shooting for a darker Star Trek and he made it happen.The points of the show I didn't like was that the ship always seems to have some sort of problem and that shields and weapons are almost always offline or not working. It also seemed like the crew wasn't trained well-enough for combat fighting. After a while it appears as if all combat is turn-based. (If you don't know what I mean think of it this way: One person fires and then the enemy fires and continues back and forth.).By the end of the show itself the writing formats seemed to be predictable. After season 5, each episode seemed to start ending abruptly. Within the last 5 minutes it seems that everything episode or problems gets solved and life goes back to normal without any residual effects. After watching full seasons with that kind of writing, the show starts to get a little tiresome.Overall, this is a wonderful show. It outlines betrayal, morality, trust, honor and integrity. Each episode takes you on journey to learning a new life lesson.\",\n",
       "  \"I have been watching the star trek shows from TNG to Enterprise and having just finished Voyager I must say I really do love this series. I grew up with TNG so it will always be #1...plus Picard nuff said. Voyager offers a show that's just as good, with a great cast and awesome show dynamics. I do think Voyager should have acquired some better technology from the delta quadrant. Endgame shows voyager as a wicked starship with Borg inspired weapons and Armour but that's it one episode of really good quality new weaponry. I find also the technical aspect of the show was far better than TNG DS9 and Enterprise. They explained things in more detail and ran into truly interesting space oddities coupled with better CG representations. Which is the reason I hate TOS so much, I'm not from that time so I really find the visuals and special effects lame and boring.\",\n",
       "  'Voyager has the strange distinction of being the first Trek series that I didn\\'t like. To me there\\'s a throughline of complexity that runs from TOS to DS9 and then just stops at Voyager. An intriguing premise is spoiled early on with pretty much all the Maquis conflict resolved within 4 episodes. The \"unfamiliar\" Delta quadrant ends up being populated with species that are largely derivative of other races already seen.Lacking imagination the writers sought to shoehorn as much of TNG\\'s cast offs into the show as possible: Lieutenant Barclay, Troi, and how could we forget the Borg. One of the biggest mistakes the show made was to return to the Borg well too often. Every time we learned something new about the collective their power and presence was compromised. How many times can a poorly equipped science vessel defeat them before all menace is removed? Voyager lacked originality and never strove to bring anything different to the franchise. The characters lacked any real sparkle and the episodic nature of the show ended up making a number of characters look schizophrenic, especially Janeway, who see-sawed in her behaviour depending on what the episode called for. This was further compounded by Kate Mulgrew whose goose-like voice, overexpressively constipated facial expressions and robotic body movements made watching a disbelieving experience.The biggest downfall of the show was that the solution to everything seemed to be technology, especially Borg for the last few seasons. The solution to problems being the pressing of buttons did not make for high drama.Voyager had the occasional excellent episode, usually the 2 parters, and it did have some good actors amongst the cast, though the parts they played rarely gave them the opportunity to display this.Voyager is regarded as the beginning of the end of Trek, being less popular than its predecessors and less well regarded critically than what had come before. Voyager, like Enterprise, failed to keep pace with the wider changing TV environment to which shows like DS9 and Babylon 5 were early adopters (and maybe even trend setters - there would be no programmes like 24 or Lost without shows like these). It isn\\'t so much a bad show as \"bad by comparison\".',\n",
       "  \"Great show- 'almost' the best start to finish show of all time, but it has some slow patches in early seasons before it becomes really awesome and like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and gives each season a clear beginning/end and unique concept to a story-line and really starts cooking. One of the best finales to a show, and a perfect wrap up that none of the other Star Trek shows (or many shows) have ever achieved to date.\",\n",
       "  'Perhaps the last of the sci-fi series saga that portrays future in glorious light and not try to bring future down to \"man\" size like so many of the sci-fi series that came since then (including Star Trek\\'s own \"Enterprise\" series). The characters, the special effects, the production design are of highest creativity and beauty, something epitome of sci-fi has strived for since first sci-fi appeared on screen.I\\'m not sure why sci-fi characters started getting merged with working class heroes in recent years, but this only shrinks the genre in my opinion. If this series was the swan song for the beautiful portrayal of our future, I think the loss is great.As a die hard sci-fi fan, this series was the last of the great sci-fi epic. If you see that the subsequent series \"Enterprise\" became the first Star Trek series to be canceled due to poor ratings, I believe that there is still a market for great sci-fi epic like the Star Trek Voyager.In my opinion this was the best of Star Trek series with best production design, and character portrayal. I would love to see more Star Trek series continue in this vein and I hope other sci-fi series will follow suit.'],\n",
       " [\"We knew already that Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision and the craftsmanship to go with it. Extraordinary battle scenes. Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield's eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!\",\n",
       "  'As someone from Sydney, Australia I was proud at the way this was filmed. Using the Hollywood model, there would have been lots of sets but using actual buildings allowed a lot of warmth to come through in the natural light. Gibson is a fine director, I was impressed with his framing, he shoots very closely for the acting stuff (more head and shoulder) which is quite interesting on the eye. Using more natural light it is quite beautiful. I suspect Gibson will not yet have been forgiven for his personal life to get the recognition he deserves.This movie could have been another Forest Gump, it could overly sentimental, instead, carries an appropriate amount of sincerity. The backstory is a major part of the movie. Doss is portrayed as uneasy with the girls who fell for the first pretty thing he saw. This could have been so Forest Gump-like but strikes a nice chord.The cast was excellent. Hugo Weaving was perfection. He carried the first half of the movie as the battle-fatigued (PTSD) WW1 vet father. Some may complain that the women are poorly portrayed as are the Japanese, who are largely like ants coming from their mound or canon fodder.As brutal as the second half is, I am sure it could not convey how truly gallant Doss was or brutal it was in reality.',\n",
       "  \"When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss' phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.Hacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It's the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss' arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.Speaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you'll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they're wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.Coming to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it's great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.The supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I'd see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.Few films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that's why I have to say it's a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It's right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen.\",\n",
       "  \"I was lucky enough to sneak into a cast & crew screening at the Newtown Dendy cinema. I thought 10.30AM on a Sunday was too early for a Mel Gibson movie, that I might be in for something along the lines of the heavy-handedness of THE PASSION OF THE Christ, and the adrenaline pumped brilliance of APOCALYPTO.I was proved wrong because after the first thirty minutes I wasn't sure if this was a Mel Gibson film when I was placed into a comfort zone, with its melodrama set in a small Virginia town during the Forties, a schmaltzy romance, and the cliché violent drunken father who survived a brutal war. The performances were maybe a little let down by the clumsy dialogue, but all directed safely with a natural sense of storytelling.By the 2nd act, I was put on high alert in the military training with our protagonist, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield who I at first felt was wrongly cast, but he really came through in the end). It was here when the true purpose of the story began to evolve, that of Doss' moral and internal conflict with using a gun! What he had to endure and stand-up for was a courage I greatly admired. It was also in this phase of the film that the dialogue and characters began to shine. Maybe it was the introduction of Vince Vaughn's character. We all know how Vaughn is notorious in ad-libbing, and it seemed to help because the other actors bounced off it well.Now the story had me in their pocket because by the 3rd act I was with our protagonist and his platoon when they got to the battlefield graveyard of Hacksaw Ridge. You thought the horrific situation in WE WERE SOLDIERS was brutal, well this was captured so vividly that you felt you were there. It was almost on par with the brilliance of GAME OF THRONES; BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS.Now I felt I was in a Mel Gibson film. As with Braveheart, the battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge didn't hold back. Maybe a notch better because of today's CGI (and I didn't even notice the effects!). The scenes were unflinching, haunting and in your face. Possibly showing you the true horror of war. Definitely not for the squeamish.The religious aspect of the film was relevant to the story, so as a non-believer I thought it was an integral part of the protagonist and had to be told, so it didn't bother me as much.Overall the technical aspect of the film was brilliant, but then again I didn't really notice it because I was too distracted by the story and the characters, and when that occurs, I know the film has succeeded.\",\n",
       "  \"Just watched this movie at the pre-screening and feel like I owe it to the creators to write a review. Having read other reviews, it is hard to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be surprised if we don't see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss's act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it's place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.\",\n",
       "  \"Hacksaw Ridge is not a film for the feint-hearted. Right away the opening scenes portray the horror of war, and the emotional journey is only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war-hero Desmond Doss. One of the great feats of storytelling from Mel Gibson (director) and Andrew Garfield (leading role, Desmond Doss) is to lead the audience along Doss' journey with a feeling of having experienced the journey as Doss, and experiencing the wide range of emotions endured by this heroic character along his journey.Neither war itself nor violence are glorified in the film, yet they also not derided. The elements of conflict that draw the storyteller – the heroism of overcoming adversity, the bonding of soldiers, and the brave resolve on which soldiers must rely to perform their duty amidst such chaos and terror – these elements are all present, but they placed alongside the horror, the madness and the terror of war, and used to draw in the audience for Doss' journey. The lasting psychological impact for those who survive conflict is well told by Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Doss' father, whose lines could serve as a mouthpiece for many veterans.The supporting roles add depth, with both script and performance making very few, if any, of the supporting characters two dimensional. Vince Vaughn's excellent turn as Doss' training sergeant provides both humour and pathos to bring laughs and pause- for-thought at well scripted points of the tale, allowing the audience to gather their breath.By the end of the film, audience members will leave the cinema feeling tired, worn out by having experienced Doss' journey of hope, innocence, love, confusion, anger, faith, and courage. Hacksaw Ridge is in no way a popcorn-lazy-Sunday-afternoon film; it is a journey.\",\n",
       "  'With its late release over here in England, by the time the film was released, it had already come to prominence with overwhelming reviews and 6 Oscar nominations to its name, so I entered with relatively high expectations, which I generally find to be a bad call as you tend to be let down, however Gibson\\'s first directorial effort in a decade, \\'Hacksaw Ridge\\', is a raw and emotional gut punch.With the history of cinema being littered with the production of World War II films, primarily in the form of over-the-top propaganda pictures such as \\'Saving Private Ryan\\' (which nonetheless I still love), it\\'s nice to see a movie that delves down the path of anti- war and focuses on the true-life tale of an uncaped superhero over fictional splendour, and \\'Hacksaw Ridge\\' is just that. The film starts with rather over-sentimental, soap opera style tendencies which are occasionally funny to watch, but nonetheless they are perfect at delivering character development to our front-running hero Desmond Doss. I was initially expecting a \\'Pearl Harbor\\' approach, with over an hour of lovey-dovey sentimental crap followed by under-accomplished action, but it was quite the opposite. The opening features the stated character development drama, but gives us an insight into Doss\\'s personal reasons for his faith and religious approaches, then thrusts us into war.Now, the war scenes... well, let\\'s just say they\\'re some scenes I doubt I\\'ll be forgetting anytime soon. They\\'re epic, they\\'re visceral, they\\'re emotional, they\\'re gory, but above all else, they are executed perfectly. Upon reaching the top of the Maeda Escarpment, nicknamed \"Hacksaw Ridge\", the squad are instantly driven into the horrors of war, the loss of friends and hope. The raw and visceral images are maybe even a little too realistic. Dead bodies are strewn across the ground, innards and entrails litter the floor, smoke and fire choke the landscape. This is war.\\'Hacksaw Ridge\\' is a hard-hitting film that if watched and truly understood, will be an unforgettable experience, and the concluding interviews with the real-life Doss add to the emotional core. The cinematography is stunning, the music is beautifully alluring and the performances, especially from Andrew Garfield, are beyond fantastic, Garfield completely embodies the persona of Doss with sheer accuracy. Further shoutouts to Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington and the surprisingly brilliant Vince Vaughn. This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films to have graced 2016... or 2017 here in the UK! We forgive you Gibson!',\n",
       "  \"Hacksaw Ridge is the latest film from the infamous Mel Gibson and it is as electrifying as one would come to expect. Telling the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. The untold story of Doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell. Starring Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Teresa Palmer, Hacksaw Ridge is a beautifully acted and viciously portrayed war film that will stick with you from the minute the film starts until the second the end credits start. It will leave you clawing your seat, wiping away the sweat from your palms as we see Garfield's Doss save as many lives as he possibly can while dodging bullets and hand grenades. The film starts in the most somber of times in American history, the second world war. Desmond Doss, the son of a PTSD-riddled alcoholic Army man (Hugo Weaving) who served in World War I, is also as much as a devout Christian as he is a patriot, leading him to join the fight against the oppressive Japanese military. Doss is in love with a small town girl Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) who is scared that she'll never see Doss again, especially after the persecution he is sure to face. When in training camp, Doss refuses to touch a gun and is actually court marshaled for his refusal. This leads to a trial in which he is allowed by his superior officers to go into Okinawa with no fire arm to protect him. Much of the film is steeped in realism, something that Mel Gibson specializes in when it comes to violence. While the story and plot line may sound very traditional, the way it is portrayed is a fresh burst of life into a tired genre such as this. That, coupled with the amazing true-life story of Desmond Doss being portrayed on screen, makes Hacksaw Ridge a wild and brutal trip down the path to Christianity and the power that faith can give a man. Gibson, a devout Catholic himself, would be the director to bring this story to life. His religious views seep through his very being, especially through his films and this film is no exception. The film settles in the idea that God is literally protecting Doss, not only physically but spiritually as well. Doss is constantly tested throughout the film, almost needing to take a life (which is the ultimate sin to him) in many scenes. The fact that this man did not fire a single round and saved as many men as he did is astounding and the film really does an amazing job at showing the harsh realities of war but also showing the good that can be brought out in a man through his faith. The film itself, is one of Gibson's less preachy works which makes it more accessible. Even if faith-based films are not your thing, you can appreciate the craft that went into making this film. Hacksaw Ridge displays war as atrocious as it truly is. There is blood, there is gore and there are a couple wounds that will cut even the strongest of men down. This is an extremely violent film but it is extremely violent in the sense that there is enough going on around us to never make us truly settle in the violence which would take away a lot of the impact that Gibson is trying to portray. The film is paced very nicely and does feel more like a traditional war film without it really being the traditional World War II film. The filmmaking is traditional but the story is unique and is definitely the driving force to run out and see this film. The performance from Andrew Garfield is amazing. He sheds any sort of preconceived notion and really embodies the roll of Doss quite well. He is far from a revelation but he is on the right track in delivering a very fine performance. The screenplay is tight and taught. Like I said, there are scenes that are heart pounding in this film. Personally, I found myself holding my breath during some of the action sequences. It was THAT intense at parts. While I do have great things to say about this film, I will say, I was a bit disappointed in the performances all around. While I thought Garfield did an amazing job carrying a film that was not Spider-Man, I wish he was a little better. I felt the same way with the rest of the cast. The melodrama that is portrayed very early on in the film is something that does begin to corrode the realist efforts of everything else. However, once the action starts, so does the really great acting on everyone's parts. Gibson is an actor that revels in the moments of pure chaos and he expects the same thing from his actors. It makes for some intense scenes that are elevated by the pure realism that the actors portray. You actually feel as though you are watching these people go to war. It is a testament to Mel Gibson as a director. He really knows how to put you in the moment and Hacksaw Ridge just solidifies his talent. Overall, I felt Hacksaw Ridge was an extremely brutal and visceral war film that brings up questions of warfare, humanity and religion while displaying Gibson's excellent eye for technical accuracy and assaulting imagery. Say what you will about Gibson as a person but as a director he is sharp, gritty and a master at what he does.\",\n",
       "  \"Good war-films can be very disturbing to watch. The dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find Hacksaw Ridge (2016) one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema. If it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism.The film plays in two halves: the early life and romance of Army Medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the actual Battle of Hacksaw Ridge. Raised in bible best Virginia, Doss had a troubled upbringing under an abusive father. A devout Seventh-day Adventist, he swore never to commit violence or even carry a weapon but felt duty-bound to enlist in the Army. Not long after meeting the one love of his life, nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), he enlisted with the belief that he could serve his God unarmed and without killing enemy soldiers.Branded a coward and bullied to leave, he was eventually granted conscientious objector status and became one of the troops sent to capture Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa of May 1945. While the assault was forced to retreat under overwhelming enemy fire, Doss remained behind and single-handedly evacuated 75 casualties, lowering them by rope from an escarpment over 100 metres high. The Ridge was eventually captured and Doss became one of the most decorated heroes of World War II.The heroism depicted in this story is of such an extraordinary magnitude that it can easily overwhelm any consideration of the film's merits. With an uncomplicated and factual narrative arc, the story rests on two pillars: acting and filming. On both scores, this film deserves high praise. While the early life and romance chapter drifts towards melodrama, Garfield is cast to perfection as the wide-eyed and straight talking man of unshakeable principle and Palmer convincingly plays his adorable emotional anchor. Together with a strong support cast that includes several big-name stars, this is a powerful ensemble that carries the story convincingly.The most outstanding element of this film, however, is its powerhouse hyper-realistic cinematography and spectacular set constructions that relentlessly convey the brutality of war. While it is an outstanding technical production, giving spectacle precedence over narrative is the film's Achilles Heel. One or maybe a few helmeted heads shredded or bodies bayonetted can convey much, but twenty deadens the senses. If ever there was a case where less could have been more, this is it. Otherwise this is a gripping film with forceful storytelling about a remarkable war hero.\",\n",
       "  'I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of HACKSAW RIDGE in Hollywood and was impressed. The screenplay is authentically-driven to the last detail and portrays the horrors (and prejudices) of wartime conduct. I knew we were watching an epic film when at the conclusion, the audience was stunned so much so that the applause was delayed.If you consider yourself a true patriot of America, this movie portrays YOUR values in a blessed light. For ONE gentlemen, amidst extremely adverse treatment by his own comrades and even more deadly hated by his enemy to have save SO many men... is simply epic.I watched the advanced screening with members of the military and faith community alike. At no time did anyone retract from the horrors of war or add asinine political commentary. We all understood that soldiers fight for one another before they fight for a cause and that hatred of war is universal; even among soldiers.',\n",
       "  \"War films can be a bit hard to sit through, with its graphic depictions of key battles in history, strong themes of power, brotherhood and the effect it has among the world but with Mel Gibson's latest war drama 'Hacksaw Ridge' it manages to be something more that we can grasp it.The true life story of Desmond Doss is finally brought to the big screen, Doss was a US Army medic who served during WWII, but coming from a family with a strong religious beliefs and a father that struggled with the aftermath of WWI (a veteran himself) it lead him to be a Seventh-day Adventist, refusing to bare a firearm and the use of violence against another. His personal choice would affect his country's army and persuaded a court hearing to charge Doss for his personal beliefs and objection to bare arms but despite this, he is given the chance though to fight alongside his 'brothers' in the Battle of Okinawa, a battle which the American forces fought against the invading Japanese in an intense and brutal battle. It is here in this key battle that Doss was recognised as a true hero for his country, as he managed to rescue the lives of 75 soldiers wounded in battle.Gibson returns to the director's chair to helm this true story, giving his touch of humanistic quality, anti-war themes and brutality to the horrors of war to much great detail. The direction is pretty much on point throughout and never goes dull or loses itself during the 2 ½ running time. The first half of the film is about character and what establishes Doss to become a legend that he is known for, while the 2nd half of the film focuses on his role during the Battle of Okinawa and the brutal battle itself. The violence here is given so much detail, not holding back on the horrors of war and the devastating effect it carried on both sides. The production design, sound mixing, editing and scale of the battle is as intense, horrifying and respectful to the details and real life experiences to what we've read in history books, but it is yet filmed with beautiful and yet brutal detailing that echoes much to Saving Private Ryan's D-Day battle sequence. The 2nd half of the film is much darker than the first half and people will need a strong stomach to handle the graphic depictions of violence and deaths we see throughout, but it does get emotional at times and in the last few minutes of the film, though overall the film is emotional with Doss's back-story, his personal lifestyle and the brotherhood that Doss and his army experience and share on the battlefield.In terms of acting, the cast as a whole is incredible with Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer giving the best key performances of the film. Garfield has come a long way to prove himself as a worthy actor, breaking away from his well known role as Spider-Man prior to HR. To describe his role as Doss, he gives a quality that defines him as a simple man with values in his life while facing a few struggles that form his belief of not bearing violence or firearms. Garfield must have given much study and preparation for the role, as his character's journey from a wise simple man to a hero of his army is given so much heart, emotion and bravery to make the journey of Doss so believable.Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is a film that will leave audiences in state of emotion that describes the horrors of war, the bravery of Doss and his army and a sense of thankfulness to our past ancestors who had lived in a time to fight for freedom and peace when the world was divided. An incredible film that will indeed earn its amount for Oscar nominations and wins in 2017 (possibly for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Production Design, Music Score, Sound Mixing & Editing and Script) alongside other film awards. A must see film if you have studied history at school, have an interest in history or if you love a solid war film that's true to its core. A masterpiece that will not be forgotten so quickly or never will, we both highly recommend it.5/5 Autistic Reviewers\",\n",
       "  'For well over a year now I have been waiting with baited breath to see this movie. I have been a fan of Desmond Doss from a child. Having the privilege of the movie being filmed in my neck of the woods, and even getting to watch some of the scenes being filmed and meeting Mel in the process (ever so briefly), escalated my enthusiasm. When you are that pumped and euphoric, you are usually deflated when the moment finally comes\\x85 but not this time.Although there were a few aspects of the story that were not as accurate as I would have liked, I realize poetic licence is necessary in some ways to give the real essence of the story. And truth can be so much harder to believe then fiction sometimes. Mel managed to portray the man Doss so very well. Some people are worried this is a religious propaganda/anti-gun movie and I assure you that is not the message of it at all. However there is no getting past the truth of who he was and it is the reason the story is so powerful. He was a man with an unmovable moral compass and it doesn\\'t matter if you don\\'t point yours in the same direction, you can\\'t help but respect him for his courage, bravery, and unwavering faith. The movie starts laying the background of the man that will be the hero of Hacksaw Ridge. It is both witty and endearing. Andrew Garfield nails the roll as the gentle scarecrow of a man. He is a bit gawky and yet charming. His accent is true to the real Desmond, awkward though it is at times. He really draws you into the character and shows you what a fighter he was, non-violent but a fighter just the same. It is well explained what personal experiences have lead him to his discussion to not touch a gun.Hugo Weaving masterfully plays Desmond\\'s alcoholic dad, battling with his demons from WWI, and Rachel Griffiths plays his devoted Christian mother trying to hold them all together. Teresa Palmer plays Dorothy, a nurse that captures Desmond\\'s heart. Sometimes cheesy, but then again in reality it would have been, and it is very amusing to watch. Teresa\\'s Dorothy is a beautiful and charming addition to the movie.Vince Vaughn plays the roll of Drill Sergeant Howell. He adds humour with his name calling, and humiliation of the soldiers, but is a very genuine - just a guy trying to win a war and keep his men alive in the process - kind of guy. Luke Bracey is a fantastic addition to the cast as private Smitty, the more traditional war story soldier.True to his reputation Mel does not hold back with the battle scenes. The devastation is already extensive and the ground strewn with bits of bodies by the time the 77th arrives. The shattering reality of war is dizzying and full of impact, moving so quickly you can barely identify the characters in a whirlwind of panic, pain and death. But amidst the chaos, Desmond Doss\\'s character is revealed to everyone and even his harshest critics realize how wrong they were about him. Watching the story change from having the battalion hate him so much that they try to have him imprisoned, to refusing to go on the battlefield without him, is so moving and inspiring it leaves \"It\\'s A Wonderful Life\" in the carnage on the hill, getting eaten by maggots along with the dead soldiers Desmond sifts through looking for \"one more\" soul to save.',\n",
       "  'I saw the movie with a number of friends this evening. Of the 10, 3 of us are combat veterans, with a total of 5 wars between us. (2 Vietnam, 2 Desert Storm and a current war in the Middle East veteran.) All the non-combat veterans thought the battle scenes were \"so horribly, so frighteningly realistic.\" Those who have been to war thought they were incredibly cartoon-ish.The tactical mistakes such as bunching up, not seeking cover, bodies flying through the air, artillery explosions obviously gasoline, all the ridiculous yelling, were all so blatantly wrong. It was the worst depiction of battle we ever saw.If the Japanese occupied the top of the \"ridge\" why didn\\'t they simply cut down the cargo netting the troops climbed? Why didn\\'t they throw grenades down on the assembled Americans below? How did the cargo netting ever get there is US troops didn\\'t already occupy the top of the mountain? Vince Vaughn was the Basic Training sergeant, again, best described as cartoon-ish. Peter Sellers as Inspector Cleuseau would have been more realistic.Quite frankly, there is nowhere enough space here to tell you how bad this movie really is.In reality, battle is hell, in some ways worse than what was shown on the screen, but in terms of realism, this movie is atrocious.',\n",
       "  'I begin my review by saying that I respect the history and the events that took place in WW2 and I have the utmost respect for the guys who gave their life for that cause. Having said that, let me tell you my opinion about the movie. And only the movie.Well, first of all I found it dull and uninteresting. The actors were fake. The scenes looked like rehearsals and uncut material. It was split in two half: the first was about nothing (well you could say stubbornness and stupidity because I was made to fell nothing for the main character except annoyed and uninterested) and the second about guts and gore. Did I said the actors looked FAKE? Oh, yeah. But man, oh man that was the main problem for me. The actors looked fake and the entire movie looked like a poorly made joke.The plot was something like this: let\\'s establish the motives, good. Now the cause... good and now the effects. Perfect. Now we can move on. The audience got it. And so on and so forth. Now lets slip in some romance. You can\\'t have a movie without romance. Good, check! Now let\\'s be jerks about it and make his life uncomfortable in the army, check! But hey, he got beliefs, check! ONE BIG CHECK LIST. No emotion, no heart, no nothing. A dead flat feeling.Let me tell you few spoilers from the movie that I found to be really bad.the scene where he meets the guys from the army in the barrack. Why in the hell should you put a naked guy (no brains, just muscles) to do pull-ups naked? Why? Because the target audience appreciate it? Little girls can\\'t watch a movie that has no naked buff guys in it? I can only imagine the guys who made that crap scene: OK, guys I have an idea! We will introduce a stupid character that will do pull-ups naked in the barrack. But why? Doesn\\'t matter, but it will be very funny and in that way we please the target audience. And check that out. We will make him run naked outside the barrack because the sergeant wouldn\\'t let him get dressed and he will be forced to run naked during their exercises. Ha ha, so funny, NOT!.the scene where they fight the Japanese. At some point the tough guy in the unit picks up a half dismembered body to use it as a shield and charged the battlefield killing 20 Japanese. WTF? At that point I was laughing and couldn\\'t believe how bad this looks. Mel is becoming senile.another scene when some doctor got wounded and Dodds wanted to give him plasma and the doctor says \"No, give it to the other guy I don\\'t know!\". And he did. After several minutes we see a scene where Dodds asks about the doctor and another guy says \"He didn\\'t make it. He didn\\'t have the plasma\". And he makes a stupid face and we as the audience understand everything. WOW that was very educating. It was explained to us like we were some retards and didn\\'t understand the sacrifice he made. Very poorly done. Cheap.The battle looked like it was made by acrobats all jumping in spectacular ways, turning, twisting. All was about guts and gore. The more gore the better. Its as if the film was thought to get better with every gruesome scene over and over again. But it got worse. At some point after seeing so many body parts it became a joke. It began to fail and I was made to smile at how stupid this looks. Every scene made me think how the directors were scheming and constipating with ideas that were suppose to shock us until they run out of ideas and they just put more guts, gore and blood. That will shock them.I can continue to rant about this movie as every scene has flaws and doesn\\'t deliver. I wouldn\\'t call this movie an Oscar or even a mention. Mel\\'s only good movie was Braveheart and I stand by that. I cant believe how easy people fall for this violence nonsense mixed with religion and patriotism. Could it be that this a recipe for successful movies? Or we are ashamed to admit this is a crap movie because we are afraid that others will look upon us and accuse us we don\\'t respect history and heroes? Wake up people!',\n",
       "  \"Although we have only just nudged our way into February I nominate this as a contender for Worst Film of 2017. It might even win.This is a film of two halves. In fact the transition between one and the other is so abrupt that you could be forgiven for thinking you are watching two different films. The first half is comprised of two acts.Act 1 sees us in Disneyland with a saccharine sweet love story told as only the Americans can do with a plethora of sickly smiles, gleaming perfect white teeth, pretty pastel colours and every damn country boy and country girl cliché in the teenage book of dreamy heart fluttering romance.Act 2 Army training camp. New wet behind the ears recruits and a sergeant major set on making men of them. Familiar territory. You know the score: the recruits will be wheeled out fully formed and ready labelled from the casting department.. The tough one. The farmer boy one. The handsome one. The oddly short one. The goofy one. And the evil one who from the off sets out to make our hero's life a misery. And the signpost also tells you that an hour down the line in this film they will be best buddies. The sergeant major now does what all sergeant majors do in every boot camp film you have ever seen he yells and screams bawls and bellows just half an inch from the face of every recruit. Of course he saves the best of his decibels for our hapless hero.Turns out our hero doesn't want to carry a rifle he just wants to be a medic. So instead of congratulating him on this noble and potentially useful choice of army career he gets bawled out and they treat him like something the sergeant major scraped of the bottom of his size twelve boots.But with the help of his demented dad and his pretty and expertly permed smiling gal our hero escapes a court martial. The gal gives her guy a bible. We saw that coming. Part Two: Our hero and his buddies are gathered at the foot of a cliff. The only way up to Hacksaw Ridge is via a single wide rope ladder. Atop the ridge are approximately a quarter of a million Japanese soldiers. All is quiet. And you can't help wondering why those evil Nips (their term, not mine) haven't simply chopped down the rope ladder or why they are not massed along the top lobbing mortars and grenades down on the troops below.But we have been assured at the start of this epic masterpiece that we are watching a true story so we have to accept that this is how it happened. But that rope ladder still bothers me.However...the troops clamber up the ladder and they are on top of the cliff – and all hell breaks loose after a bombardment from some offshore guns.Now let me state here that I have read about the battles against the Japanese for control of the Pacific islands and am fully aware of the terrible fighting that ensued. The Japanese fought with suicidal recklessness not seen since Medieval times. But in this film that fighting is presented in such an orgiastic way with almost pornographic detail of spilled entrails, pools of glistening blood, severed limbs, decapitated heads, mangled half torsos and spaghetti shredded legs that the suspicion is that the director and writers have intentionally set out to out-gore every war film that has gone before. Every time a soldier looks up a bullet neatly penetrates his helmet and skull. Every time there is an explosion three men are catapulted into the air by some clever hidden device. And then there is more blood and guts and half- men screaming for their moms. The tidal wave of Japs overwhelms the US soldiers and miraculously they all escape down the one rope ladder. It's not shown how they get their wounded down there but hey ho... What of our hero...? Well he is still up top – now alone with the dead and wounded that have been left behind. A few Japs take some pot shots at him but then they all disappear back to their tunnels for some chow.Leaving our hero free to drag the wounded to the cliff edge. This is an heroic task in itself but now he has to get them to safety. He proceeds to lower them down the two hundred feet sheer cliff face. Actually there are only two blokes down there, smoking and chewing the fat. But they do a sterling job sending the wounded back to camp. Oddly no-one thinks to send a soldier or two – or twenty – up the trusty rope ladder to help our hero. They just hang around below waiting for the next dangling hospital candidate.And so it goes on. When our exhausted hero does eventually fling himself down with a rope there just happens to be scores of his buddies waiting for him. Shame they didn't have the balls to go up and help him. But they all line up cinematically so that our hero can be led away.At the risk of upsetting the 'Special Relationship' we have with our pilgrim brothers and sisters on the other side of the pond – and I know my fellow countrymen will understand this – Hacksaw Ridge is just too American. A much better script and a British director would have delivered a subtle, more sympathetic film with less of your usual jingoism and more of the real drama and nuances of war.This is a true story. A story of towering heroism. Real men fighting real battles. But in this mess of a film that story has been reduced to nothing more than a comic book reality. And all concerned deserved better than that.\",\n",
       "  \"After reading many positive reviews here and elsewhere, I was eager to see this. But to my surprise this turned out to be one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen. The first half is the cheesiest piece of Hollywood cinema in recent years and the second half contains the stupidest war action ever aside from comedy; it seemed like slapstick to me! I really have no clue how people can rate this highly. A total disaster of a movie!\",\n",
       "  '\"I have seen stalks of corn with better physiques.\" Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) Director Mel Gibson is an action genius and along with that compliment, let\\'s add he knows his violence. Hacksaw Ridge is a true and heroic story of the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor for bravery in battle. Brave also could be any attempt to separate the film from its controversial director, but I\\'ll let the film speak for itself.The contradiction is real: Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) was a Seventh Day Adventist who not only refused to work on Saturdays, but he also refused even to touch a gun. Through the intervention at a court martial of his improbably brave and conflicted father (Hugo Weaving), Doss is allowed to serve as a medic under those conditions, proving to all that he could be braver saving men at Okinawa\\'s Hacksaw Ridge than anyone else (75 men as a medic with a flair for ingenious rescuing).Although Director Gibson is best known for his graphic depictions of violence in Apocalypto and The Passion of the Christ, he can also be accused, along with writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan, of clichéd story telling. The film\\'s two parts, at home and at war, follow some pretty trite set-ups such as the mountain boy smitten by the nurse, the call to righteous service, the tough drill sergeant ( a terrific Vince Vaughn, see opening quote), and the sentimental trench dialogue.Yet these flaws work when the story needs them to establish Doss\\'s kind heart, courage, and the essential goodness of fellow combatants as they confess they misread him and his conscientious objection. If you can forgive the almost unreal, lush setting for his youth in Lynchburg, Virginia, and his mooning for his future wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer), then you will enjoy seeing a real hero in a real war.Yes, Gibson knows how to depict action, not just pain, and it helps make Hacksaw Ridge a welcome addition to war films that tell true stories. And lest I forget, welcome back, Mel; you have been redeemed.',\n",
       "  \"This was a wonderful depiction of immense courage in the face of adversity--one of the most intensely moving films we've ever seen. My father was a Marine veteran of Okinawa and I personally really appreciate the research that went into making this great movie. He never shared much of his story with me while he was alive, and though my father didn't see combat in the battle depicted, this movie gave me many insights into what he saw when he was only 20 years old.There were many times during the movie that i was moved to the point of tears, and overall this was an emotionally gripping but yet still entertaining depiction of the horrors of war and the reality faced at Okinawa. HIghly highly recommended. Do not skip seeing this in theaters!\",\n",
       "  \"This is a sweet movie. It's very very sweet. In fact, it's so sweet that you can almost see the syrup dripping from the screen. And don't get fooled by the colors. This movie has a more black/white feel to it, heaven or hell, good or bad, etc etc.And I'm confused. Is this a political movie? I don't know anything about Mr Gibson's political views, but if this is it - I'm not buying.Is it a religious movie? If so, what is the message? That it's OK to go to war in the name of God?.I'm confused. So...what am I missing. Well, some nuances for starters! We have this clean-cut handsome James-Dean guy and his gorgeous sweetheart girlfriend (this is where the movie is sooo white and happy), and then we have this gruesome war where everything is very very black. And the Japs are evil. End of story. Is it that simple? Hmm...don't think so.This is a hard movie to rate. I give it 1/10 colorful nuances but a whooping 10/10 syrup bottles!

       "  'I saw Hacksaw Ridge last night here\\'s my opinion.... I don\\'t know if that was supposed to be a historically accurate movie, since they had the actual veterans that they interviewed at the end of the movie But it was more like a Mel Gibson snuff film glorifying the act of killing people and some weird Christian stuff too. IF it was supposed to be a historically accurate movie they probably should drop the scene of a BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle) gunner holding a limbless bloody human torso with one hand (like a shield) while running toward a Japanese position and firing the BAR with one hand. The most shocking part was that they stole the scene from Saving Private Ryan!! The Soldier\\'s started throwing 60mm mortar rounds after bumping the bottom of the shells on their helmets. 😑 As if that was done on a regular basis. There were also several grenades having the pins pulled with teeth and lightly flicking them away. (FYI, if you try to do this in real life you will crack your teeth off). ....Followed by flamethrowers that were actually more like Dragon\\'s breath, igniting dozens and dozens of Japanese soldiers. All this occurring on the screen with the audience behind me audibly saying \" Wow \"The actual cool part was when they showed the medic, heroically moving around the battlefield who ended up rescuing 75 men from Hacksaw Ridge. My one beef with this movie was that it is NOT A REALISTIC INTERPRETATION of what actually happened in WWII, in ANY sense This was more of a comedy/ glorifying gore... followed by actual interviews of real life veterans portrayed in the movie... WHICH, seemed to insinuate that everything you just watched was historically accurate. FAIL!!Also casting Vince Von to play a Sergeant 😑 with some opening scenes trying to mimic the full metal jacket humor, all of it.... epic fail and just hard to watch.On a scale of 1 to 10, the option of going to this movie or staying in my room and staring at the wall This was about a 2, and slightly better than staring at a wall...',\n",

So: boring. Predictable. Heroic. Anachronistic. Full of cliché-s. No plot whatsoever. Poor simple guy has small childhood trauma, grows up to be a fine man, goes to war, is a hero. Now, this might be a summary of a great movie; but in our case, it is everything you will find out in this one. There is, literally, nothing else. I am afraid of saying unrealistic as well, because the character was probably pretty much as depicted. Still, the portrayal is anachronistic, quite false. In fact, we have this huge powerful invading American army, smashing through all defenses of the small bad sadistic Japs (as expected) (no surprise here) (difficult to sympathize, but anyway, need to have some baddies around). And here we have an unarmed winning hero saving the poor lives of the poor victors without consideration to his own life, while his mates massacre their enemies all around, and supporting through his actions the whole round massacre, for a not-really clear reason. I mean, we love Gibson and he managed to do some great cliché heroic movies, so I was expecting more from this one. Just ain't.\",\n",

He\\'s perfectly cast and has all the mannerisms and snark that you would expect of a vampire. Teresa Palmer unfortunately, although she does her best with her stilted dialogue simply isn\\'t believable as an internationally acclaimed academic. The problem with being introduced as the youngest person ever to obtain tenure at Yale, is that you need to act and speak with a level of intelligence and authority that makes this real. Palmer just doesn\\'t have the delivery or the gravitas required, as demonstrated in one of her earliest scenes when she delivers a lecture which sounds like it was written by a teenager who forgot to do their homework and dashed something off 10 minutes before class.The main problem however, is that the opening episode simply tries to do too much too quickly. This would have worked so well as a slow burner, where the characters slowly reveal themselves over the first few hours of the show and we learn about their struggles with the identities they hold. Instead we are spoonfed everything in the first 30 minutes with awful, rushed exposition as the main characters all but point at each other and say \"You\\'re a witch\", \"And you\\'re a vampire\" in the most hamfisted attempt to get things moving forward.I\\'ve never read the books, so I can\\'t comment on the quality of the source material, but I can only assume that given the luxury of several hundred pages the story unwinds in a careful, intelligent and well paced manner.

With a book time can be taken to explain things in depth to a point that a show or movie can not accomplish unless it has a full time narrator talking constantly as the show is going. So yes, it is true that it does not follow the book to the letter however it does a good job of relying the same message one gets by reading the book. It does also jump forward at a quick pace it seems until I went back and realized just how much of the back story and details that it takes so long to cover in the book would not have worked trying to fit into the first 2 episodes of a show. It would have been mostly flashbacks if that route were taken. That being said, they will probably pull bits and pieces of memories out over the season as opposed to getting it all out at the beginning like the book.

Thankfully, I was in for a pleasant surprise.It all starts with bad CGI-monsters and some guys in Star Trek make-up chasing people around in the jungle. We then cut to some jocks doing tricks on jet skis and some bland blonde girls admiring them - and I thought this is going to be terrible. Then the story picks up and the movie gets better from there.The story involves a couple of characters and mysteries, but is never too complicated. After the initial jet ski scene, the main character actually turns out to be played quite charmingly by Alex Pettyfer. He\\'s supported by his mentor/protector (solid as always: Timothy Olyphant). Glee\\'s Dianna Agron plays Number Four\\'s love interest. She comes across very natural, so that the love story that unfolds is actually engaging instead of vomit-inducing like that of that other movie with the whining Vampires and the shirtless Werewolves.Of course, \"I Am Number Four\" is by no means a great movie. The CGI sucks in places and the make-up of the bad guys is just awful. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of a popcorn movie.However, I think we can all agree that it would be silly to actually expect a masterpiece, considering the movie\\'s premise. For what it is, \"I Am Number Four\" is an entertaining little fantasy flick for teenagers and undemanding twenty-somethings.

       "  'In a perfect world, the convoluted mess called I Am Number Four could have been great. It had all the trappings for success: based off a semi-popular novel for teens, a fairly accomplished director in D.J. Caruso, the producing \"talent\" of Michael Bay, two hot young stars in Alex Pettyfer and Glee\\'s own Dianna Agron, and an enigmatic, yet intriguing trailer campaign. So why is it that the final product is one of the most deeply unsatisfying theatrical experiences I have had in some time? Opening with the death of \"Number Three\", we jump into the life of John (Pettyfer), an alien being protected on Earth from a group called the Mogadorians. As it turns out, the Mogadorians wiped out the population of John\\'s planet years before, except for nine children with extraordinary powers. For some reason, they have to be killed in order, and with three down, John is next in line for extermination. As he goes on the run with his protector Henri (Timothy Olyphant), they settle into the small town of Paradise, Ohio. Soon after, John starts gaining and learning more about his powers. But with a new love (Agron) and his lust to just be normal thrown into the mix, John may be in more trouble than he can imagine.I have never read the source material for I Am Number Four, but I would hazard a guess that it did a half decent job of explaining what is going on, and did not just strive to set future sequels in motion. The film on the other hand, suffers because the sequel seems to be the only thing in mind outside of special effects. We are thrown right into John\\'s life, and we only get little nuggets of reason for what is going on at any given time. We never get full explanations, and are never even offered the ability to piece it together by ourselves. The film seems merely content giving us hints, offering little enigmatic moments to get us thinking. But instead of doing anything with these scenes, it merely continues trucking along to its eventual ending which promises a continuation and the hope for some further reasoning for what is happening. But if the filmmakers do not care about informing the audience now, why will we care later? But this would not be such a slap in the face if we had not already seen so many films in the past half-decade doing the exact same thing, attempting to replicate the success of the Harry Potter, Twilight and The Lord of the Rings franchises. The Golden Compass, Cirque du Freak: The Vampire\\'s Assistant, The Spiderwick Chronicles, and Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief (which this film oddly resembles) are all examples of studios making films out of young adult books, specifically to capitalize on the potential for sequels and lengthy franchise possibilities. They all failed in varying degrees, because they all suffer from the same thing I Am Number Four suffers from – not enough plot, too much dependence on a sequel. Had all of these films even attempted to be able to stand on their own, perhaps they would have gotten the sequel they seemed to think they deserved. I know Four is part of a proposed book franchise, as opposed to an already established book franchise, but it merely skipped the waiting in the middle for the eventual film.Should these plot and sequel problems not already be enough, Four suffers from copying Twilight a little too close (even including the notable musical cues from current alt-rockers). Sure, there are no vampires, but the romance between John and Agron\\'s Sarah feels a little too forced for comfort. Right in the middle of being hunted down to be systematically wiped out, we are supposed to believe that someone who has spent their life running, would simply fall in love out of the blue, and not feel any consequences? We are supposed to believe he does not know better? Sure he\\'s a teenager and we all did stupid things when we were that young, but why does the focus of the film seem to hinge on the chemistry and romance between these two star-crossed lovers? I was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion, and the need for John and Henri to keep running to avoid death. But then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story, and totally loses anything it has going for it. A last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of sci-fi is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst. It is awkward, silly, and practically plagiarizes Twilight.I will say I was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story, but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop. The film criminally underuses Olyphant, the only actor who actually acts in the entire film, and makes him into an almost useless background character. We only get glimpses of Teresa Palmer\\'s character throughout the film (the trailer already gives away any mystery of who she might be), and when she finally shows up to do something, she merely speaks in overtly sexual allusions. Pettyfer and Agron both seem to suffer from not knowing what emphasis to put on their character and when, and relative newcomer Callan McAuliffe is stuck in the cliché-ridden role as the know-it-all geek of a best friend.When it attempts to work, I Am Number Four is quite interesting. I would have loved more story, and a whole lot less romance. Even what does work (including the decent special effects) seems to suffer as a result of all the melodramatic romance.4/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).',\n",

Seeing it behind-the-scenes, I couldn\\'t imagine what it would look like. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.The acting was believable and consistent (unlike previous reviews who claim the actors lost steam halfway thru the film). Timothy Olyphant is perhaps the best character in the film, Pettyfer following right after. The best part about this film: the love story within the plot WAS NOT painful/annoying to watch (such as Twilight).This movie is definitely worth seeing in theaters, as the action scenes truly make the experience.

Why earth? Who knows. Perhaps earth\\'s atmosphere is the most similar to Lorien\\'s? A race of 7-foot tall humanoids called the Mogadorians are hunting down the children one at a time. Why? Beats me. Because we wouldn\\'t have a story otherwise, I suppose. All we\\'re really told is \"they\\'re a race who chooses to decimate rather than colonize.\" So be it.Anyway, due to some sort of spell the Mogadorians are forced to kill the nine remaining Lorien kids in the proper order. Who established the order and how? No idea. Wouldn\\'t you be pretty ticked off if you were Number One and became aware that you were chosen to be killed first? Perhaps the numbering system is completely random. Otherwise, that\\'s a pretty jacked up system. \"Hmm, little Billy seems to be a little slow upstairs, and that lisp sure ain\\'t doin\\' him any favors. Let\\'s make him Number One.\" Regardless, numbers one to three are now dead, so the story focuses on Number Four.Number Four\\'s desperate attempts to fit in lead to yet another blown cover, and he and his guardian Henri must once again relocate - this time to the small town of Paradise, OH. Following the film\\'s somewhat promising start, the story takes an ill-advised detour and bogs down in a teenage romance marsh. It\\'s at this point that Number Four (AKA John Smith) falls in love, defends a nerd against bullies, and begins to discover his unique abilities (known as legacies).This blatant drawing from the well of the Twilight series\\' formula might giddy up the hearts of teenage girls, but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film\\'s trailer promised.That arrival comes in the film\\'s third act in the form of a deus ex machina known as Number Six (Teresa Palmer) who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rumpage against the backdrop of CGI and special-effects. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences, but the drive there should\\'ve been smoother and more evenly-paced.Dialogue is weak, character development is practically non-existent, and the underdeveloped backstory creates too many questions that lead to frustration rather than intrigue. Granted, this is an origin story that\\'s specifically designed to kick-start a franchise, but a little more self-containment would have been appreciated.One of the film\\'s biggest transgressions is the misuse of Timothy Olyphant as Henri. We\\'re told that he\\'s a Lorien warrior, and as such you\\'d expect him to join in the butt-kickery. Unfortunately, he\\'s only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped (done off-screen to mask its implausibility) by a couple of out-of-shape alien conspiracy theorists. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warrior/guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom.The film presents a seed or two of hope that the franchise can improve with each installment, but will its identity crisis allow it to do so? Attempting to be all things to all teenagers could backfire if it fails to create loyalty amongst any one demographic.Teenage audiences and those who don\\'t consume themselves with the story\\'s many flaws will be more forgiving than I. Perhaps your expectations will be exceeded, but there\\'s a good chance you\\'ll be either underwhelmed or disappointed. Wouldn\\'t you rather risk a dollar at Redbox than $10 a pop at the theater? Don\\'t say I didn\\'t properly inform you.',\n",
       "  \"A great movie will leave you yearning for a sequel, and I Am Number Four certainly does. First off, the visuals were astounding. This really goes without saying, but the final battle in the movie was incredible. Another sign of a great movie, my friends and I truly liked the characters. We actually cared about what happened to them (something that I can't say about other book-to-movie Harry-Potter-wannabes.) Even number Six, a bad-ass female with Nightcrawler-like power was lovable!Finally, the storyline was engaging and easy to understand. Yes, there were some unexplained portions, but this is only the first movie in a series. I understood it just fine without having read the book, and there was no point in the movie where I felt that things were moving too slowly (nor to quickly, for that matter.)I would urge you not to take any of the negative reviews written by middle-aged men to heart - spend the 10 bucks and give this movie a chance. I promise you that you'll end up enjoying it!\",\n",
       "  'If you liked the movie \"The Covenant\", which is about a teen coming into his super powers while falling in love with a brainy yet implausibly beautiful girl who spends most of the film standing agog at what he can do, then you probably will not like \"I Am Number Four\" for the simple reason that you are no longer a 13-year-old girl and this movie is almost a direct remake.The film starts out demonstrating how cool the main character is by showing him doing various tricks on a jet-ski while maintaining perfect hair. I half expected one of his friends to shout \"Radical!\", but then I remembered that this was not made in the mid 1980s. From there it pretty much degenerates into a checklist of crappy movie clichés: Brooding teen trying to fit in even though his power causes him to be different? Check. Generic bullies not realizing who they\\'re messing with and getting their comeuppance? Check. Bad guys using girl to get to main character? Yup. Love for the girl giving the hero new strength to continue even though all looks hopeless? Double check.If you\\'re looking for a movie you can turn off your brain and enjoy then I recommend renting one of the Xmen movies. If you are a girl who has just entered her teens and is tired of movies about whiny vampires, then you might enjoy this. But don\\'t expect to remember it a week later.',\n",

We also had the pleasure of watching it on iMax so that makes just about anything a little better. If you want to enjoy the evening then go see this one. You\\'ll see some good acting and decent new actors. Give it a chance and I think this might be the next good \"series\" of movies you\\'ll like. I say series because they left this one wide open to find numbers 5, and 7-9. I can easily see a whole trilogy or more just waiting for this one to make enough money to get it going.

       "  \"We loved I AM NUMBER FOUR. The storyline was good. Good love interest teen romance. Number Six is totally smoking sexy hot. Good strong female characters. The cast, acting, & special effects reminded me of Disney's Race to Witch Mountain which we also enjoyed. Only Complaints Spoiler Alert: There is a missing scene at the end when a character you thought was dead suddenly appeared alive without any explanation. They leave it open for a sequel which we would love to see. What's up with the jock? is he alive, dead, converted to an evil zombie for the sequel? The director didn't show why the jock had a life transformation and is now nice. That is our only complaint.\",\n",

Not sure why some slammed this movie but I have no problem giving this a 9. If your looking for a good weekend movie slouching on the couch eating pizza then this is the business!If your a sci fan such as myself then this is a watchable movie very watchable. I was worried that the relationship between the main character and the photographer would run away with itself and overtake the plot as is seen is so many decent movies ruined by pointless teen relationships. But I Am Number 4 did not let this happen and it glued with the plot really well. The fight scenes were well scripted and did not go on for too long. Get the popcorn out sit back and enjoy this scifi flick I don't think you will be disappointed.\",\n",
       "  'My god! Words cannot reiterate how terrible this movie is. I didn\\'t go with high expectations. I didn\\'t expect Oscar winning performances or a witty and sharp script etc. I thought if I could give it a five or a six out of ten at most I would be satisfied with some great action, good special effects and reasonable acting, but it didn\\'t even have that. Seriously the reviewers who have given this higher than a four have seriously deluded themselves. I\\'m not a teenager, which this film is aiming for (but even then it\\'s so badly made even they shouldn\\'t like this).Before I critique this film. A brief synopsis from what I can gather. Teenager John Smith (Alex Pettyfer from Storm Breakers) who is an alien from another planet Lorien is a fugitive on the run from his enemies the Mogadarians who have been sent to destroy him after killing three other kids before him with the same abilities. Changing his identity, moving from town to town with his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant), John is always the new kid with no ties to his past. In the small Ohio town he now calls home, John encounters unexpected, life-changing events-his first love Sarah (Dianna Agron), powerful new abilities and a connection to the others like number six (Teresa Palmer) who shares his destiny. The first problem of this film is the screenplay which is a horrific mess. The synopsis I had to cobble together from a family friend who is a fan of the books (but wasn\\'t of the film). It is very loosely explained during the movie at different points with huge plot holes. If these Mogadarians want to destroy earth, why don\\'t they straight away? Why kill these teenagers who are a part of the legacy? How were the legacies and Mogadarians created? Why do the Mogadarians want to destroy earth? I think I heard something about \"resources,\" but what? Maybe this is explained in the book or subsequent ones, I don\\'t know, but for someone who hasn\\'t read them, things should have been explained and more clearly, it\\'s no excuse. Also when John saves Sarah from her ex-boyfriend and his friends pestering her at the fair, she sees him using his powers (his hands light up) to deal with the guys, but she dosen\\'t say anything??? What the heck? Then later she suddenly \"finds\" out? This sort of thing just reeks serious laziness on the hand of the writers, either that or during that scene Sarah went temporarily blind. I could go on with several other plot holes, but you get the point. The structure of the film is terribly put together with certain scenes just feeling so random, without them being linked together. Maybe the fact the film just suddenly decides to introduce new information in a convenient \"way\" like those weird creatures who guard the legacies (including a dog that turns into the creature) and the others for the Mogodarian\\'s or whatever. And while we\\'re on the subject of the Mogodarian\\'s as villains they are ridiculously laughable and not scary in the slightest. All the characters are bland with little back story like we find out literally nothing about John\\'s past or his parents. With that you just don\\'t care about them as they are little more than cardboard cut-outs. Particularly when Henri dies, in one scene with \"sad\" music. We\\'re meant to care but the characters are so shallow and boring we just don\\'t care and the whole pathetic scene just comes across as sickeningly insincere. Of course the characters being boring also comes down to terrible performances. Alex Pettyfer is just unbearably plain and looks and acts bored. He hasn\\'t got the slightest trace of acting ability (just like in Stormbreakers). None of the cast fare any better. They are all unconvincing and give some of the worst performances I\\'ve seen in films, even Teresa Palmer who I adored in The Sorcerer\\'s Apprentice could not save this. She looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue. I couldn\\'t judge her acting as such though her voice when I heard it sounded like she was trying to be sexy with a sore throat. The trollop scriptwriter who put in the embarrassingly awful and very cheesy NOT funny script that she should speak like that needs a slap.I am Number Four tries to come across as a romantic sci-fi action, but it has little action (for teen boys), only about ten minutes and even when there was, the camera jerked up and down with a shocking lack of continuity I felt dizzy and couldn\\'t make out what was going on so as a result there is no excitement you feel in \"watching\" the action. (Michael Bay who was the producer of this and still hasn\\'t learnt from Transformers 2) and little romance (for teen girls). With little romance or action, the film just pointlessly meanders itself sluggishly from scene to scene. In terms of the \"romance\" there is no chemistry between John and Sarah and even the special effects are very poor and look too obvious. The film is way too predictable with stereotypes across the board which you will notice straight away making it unimaginative and repetitive like the rest of the film. I paid £6.20 to see this abomination, I wish I hadn\\'t. This is the first turkey of the year I\\'ve awarded for a film (suppose it was only a matter of time). This is just complete rubbish and I would not advise anyone to see this travesty. There will be sequels unfortunately but I certainly won\\'t be signing up to see it. I would rather throw up thanks then put myself through seeing another one of these. Trust me I am Number Four is that crap. I would seriously advise you to skip it. It is one of the worst films I have ever encountered.',\n",
       "  'I was lucky and saw an advanced screening on this film and I was half disappointed and half impressed. First of all, I read the book and I just thought that they left out a lot of detail from the book, some big ones too. But, the visuals and action is what kept me on my seat. The story, I thought they did a decent job with, but if they sticked with parts of the story in the book, it would have been a better film. They could have made the movie longer and added some other details from the book. I mean, in the book, Henri and John can open the chest he hides together. They open it in the book, and Henri lays John down on the table and pulls out a rock like crystal from the chest and it appears as their planet, Lorien, and with that, Henri shows what happened on their planet the day it was invaded by the Mogadoriens, visually. They could have put that part in the movie, I thought it was a somewhat big part. But overall, a decent flick if you have nothing else to do or see. Check it out, I Am Number Four!',\n",
       "  'I saw an advance screening of the flick tonight. The only reason I went and saw it was because my buddy had a free screening pass for 2, and it\\'s a free screening. I remember reading the book and not being very impressed, however I can\\'t say I can pinpoint exactly what\\'s been left out since I had forgotten most of it. Not sure if I even care now that I\\'ve seen both ends of the spectrum.Caruso tries a lot to hide the book\\'s flaws, and he really does try hard. But somehow he only makes them more obvious. I\\'ll admit there was tonnes of action and good special effects, but really, when the story wasn\\'t stealing from other sci-fi (Animorphs, Johnny Mnemonic, Superman- there\\'s even an insulting John Carpenter\\'s The Thing nod too), it was overloading the audience\\'s brain with Clichés that can be found in almost any teen movie... ever. And some gigantic plot holes you could drive a tanker through.The action scenes I nearly left the cinema they were so bad. It\\'s like Caruso told the camera crew to zoom in really close while holding the camera and shake it all about, shine flashlights in the camera lens, and move it violently when some gets punched. Shaky Camera and quick cutting must die, I\\'m tired of it.The soundtrack was so bombastic and over the top. At times it sounds like the boom mic is being banged against the inside of a 50 gallon drum. At others it\\'s like they\\'re attacking their strings as fast as they can really fast. The film\\'s opening score piece over the panning shot is especially insulting- it doesn\\'t help that it lasts a minute long and the cue\\'s buildup is hilarious.I know the movie is based on a book, but with even that said, there is a tonne of clichés. Hot chick who loves photography? Check. New kid is instantly buds with the nerd? Check. Douchebag jock who loves the hot chick? Check. Kid finds out he has powers he can\\'t control? Check. evil villain are following kid and guardian? Check. Kid\\'s guardian dies and he must do the mission without him? Check.There\\'s also an annoying homo-erotic undercurrent between Sam and \"John\". Also, don\\'t get me started on the Thirty-Sue pileup that is Number 6.For every cliché, there\\'s a gigantic plot hole. Why isn\\'t the grocery clerk suspicious of an alien with a hoodie and sunglasses buying a crap load of turkeys? How is \"John\" unable to control his powers in class yet able to control them perfectly in his backyard a matter of hours later? Why do the Mogadorian(!!!!) speak with Jamaican accents? How is the dog able to become all super-dog all of a sudden? Why are Lorien so perfectly humanoid with a true lack of alien qualities? And how do Lorien copulate? Yeah, let\\'s not go there, because the last thing this film needs is a Lorien sex scene.',\n",
       "  'Of course, \"I Am Number Four\" is by no means a great movie. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of 90 minutes. The story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment like if the nine aliens are so powerful, why can\\'t they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I\\'ve never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence. But however, This is not a bad film. It\\'s just not that great. Among the good points, the visuals were astounding. The final battle in the movie is something that save the movie from being a huge disappointed. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences. And also the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic, bald, covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth, carry some pretty cool weapons, and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.The main problem is the movie is totally clichéd. I mean how many times are we going to see the exact same story. I mean this was your typical teen drama\\x85.new kid..shady past\\x85 weird and wants to stay to himself, but there\\'s always some cute chick who he risks everything for. There\\'s always bullies who hate that he\\'s got the attention of the cute chick, so they always end up having a conflict. I mean 90% of this movie was your typical high school drama teen movie. And the \"discovering\" of his powers was like the alien version of spiderman. I will say I was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story, but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop.This Twilight series\\' formula might cheer up the hearts of teenage girls, but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film\\'s trailer promised. I was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion, and the need for John and Henri to keep running to avoid death. But then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story, and totally loses anything it has going for it. A last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of sci-fi in the form of a machina known as Number Six (Teresa Palmer) who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rampage against the backdrop of CGI and special-effects, is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst.Acting wise, Alex Pettyfer is just plain with no expression but of course teenage girls will love him for his looks and physique. Dianna Agron is pretty and acts fine. Teresa Palmer who I adored in The Sorcerer\\'s Apprentice looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue. Kevin Durand as the Mogadorian Commander is good in his evil act. But one of the film\\'s biggest disappointed is the misuse of Timothy Olyphant as Henri. The film criminally under-uses Olyphant, the only actor who actually acts in the entire film, and makes him into an almost useless background character. We\\'re told that he\\'s a Lorien warrior, and as such you\\'d expect him to join in the butt- kickery. Unfortunately, he\\'s only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warrior/guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom. And then there\\'s the relative newcomer Callan McAuliffe stuck in the cliché- ridden role as the know-it-all geek of a best friend though he\\'s fine in whatever he has.All this said, though this movie isn\\'t the best action film of the year, its still worth a watch for the CGI and the last act of the movie. This is the first installment of the probable trilogy or more. So let\\'s just hope they do it right in the sequels. I rate it 5.5 out out 10.',\n",
       "  'Watched the movie \"I am number four\" tonight. The first 40 minutes it felt like I was watching a re-hashed \"Twilight\" movie rather than a sci-fi/horror pic. But then it got good. It was well worth the watch if you can make it through that first half of beaten to death formula high school angst movies that Twilight has seemed to spawn. You can bet that there will be sequels too, but they may be straight to video. The first half of the movie I give it 1 star, but it was the fault of the story, not the acting. The second half, I give it 8 stars. The acting was good, there were very nice special effects and some pretty cool alien bad guys in the style of \"Pinhead.\"',\n",
       "  \"I'll be honest here. I Am Number Four is a yawn. And when I'm not counting minutes till it's over, I'm snickering at the amazingly cheesy lines. Seriously, I haven't watched a movie with lamer lines since the Twilight series.Which was a shame, really, since I was so anticipating this movie because a) Alex Pettyfer was so cute in Stormbreaker and I'd like to see more of him, b) I love Diana Agron, and c) I love a good teen drama/superpower movie. But IANF was such a disappointment in the way that there's nothing believable about the movie AT ALL.So the Mogadorians want to kill the 9 surviving Lorien kids with superpowers (called Legacies). Why? It's not really clear. Ethnic cleansing perhaps? One of the characters explained how the 'Mogs' don't colonize, but decimate instead. So why go to all the trouble of searching for the 9 scattered in all corners of the world? Why not wipe out Earth and be done with it anyway since they live to destroy anyway, right? It didn't help that right when Number Four's number is up (pun intended), he decides he wants to be 'normal' and 'go to school'. And the overprotective guardian said yes. Sure, what's a murderous predator compared to listening to your teenage ward's whining 24/7 right? And what's with Number Four's propensity to constantly ignore (sound, life-saving) advice anyway? Is he trying to get killed? Or is it that it's more interesting to have a character that breaks all the rules since the main character never dies, anyway right? All in all, I'd say the movie's a flop. The characters are either annoying, unmemorable or carbon cutouts of every other movie. The appearance of Number Six makes it slightly more interesting but in the end she's just a blonde version of Megan Fox. The script was painfully shallow and the story's just...meh.\",\n",
       "  \"This is quite a strange movie and I could not determine whether it was a horror, a sci-fi, or a thriller. IMDb describes it as an Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller, though I would have to add elements of horror into this film. The horror elements is that the film is set in a small American town (though it is noticeable that main street has not yet been destroyed by Walmart) name Paradise (horror films always seem to be set in places with pleasant sounding names), the scene is generally dark and dreary, and the main characters are up against an mysterious force that is substantially more powerful than they are. Actually, a lot of films with the sci-fi moniker tend to actually be horror movies, and the only reason that they are sci-fi is because they involve aliens or futuristic scenes or technology. I am now thinking that sci-fi is not actually a genre in itself, but rather a thematic setting, since most sci-fi films will fall into action, horror, thriller, romance, and I will throw in fantasy as that is probably a genre in itself (though it is probably better classified as epic).This film is about a teenager (obviously so that it will appeal to a younger audience) who turns out to be from another planet. His planet was destroyed by a race known as the Mogadorians however he and a few others managed to escape from their planet and are hiding on Earth. The catch is that the Mogadorians have found their hiding place and have traveled to Earth to locate them. They have already killed three of them, and now they are after him.What we also learn of the hero (whose name is John Smith as he is trying to hide) is that he is of a special breed from his planet and as he grows older he develops extraordinary powers. We don't know if the powers are standardised or unique to each individual, though when we meet number six we suspect that it is the later. The other interesting aspect of this film is the nature of modern technology. While John Smith is attempting to hide and remain hidden, with the internet he is finding this very difficult. Further he has the urges of your average teenager to go to school and to socialise. However it is difficult to remain hidden in an American Highschool as if you are a jock, then you will be noticed, and if you shun the jock culture, then you attract attention to yourself.I guess another aspect of this film is about fitting in. In a way John wants to have a normal life, even if it involves not fitting in. We notice that he is the all American handsome hero, though he rejects that culture and befriends the school geek (and it turns out there is some connection between the school geek and his people) and the girl that has been turned into an outcast (and we also learn why she becomes an outcast). However, while at the beginning this film is about the new kid fitting in, it becomes clear that he goes from being the outcast (chased by the police as he is strange and different) to being the saviour. It should be remembered, even though it is not explicitly stated, that once the Mogadorians (whose appearance are quite monstrous in itself) have finished with their prey, they will turn onto the people of Earth, and without these protectors, they will not have a chance. Once again it shows that desire of the developed world to have a saviour that can stand up to the threats the we face on a daily basis. Unfortunately, unless one includes Jesus Christ in the fold (and Christ is not a superman in that sense of the word – he came and died so that we might be reconciled to the father, not to step up and defeat every evil force that comes our way, especially since evil in itself is quite subjective).\",\n",
       "  'I have complained many times about the films which pretend to capture the same childish spirit from Harry Potter. However, the flood of Harry Potter imitators seems to have diminished in recent months. The reason? The success of the Twilight saga provoked a \"change of direction\" from the Hollywood executives, and instead of exploring variations of \"magic boys save the world\", they are now desperately searching for new instances of \"forbidden romances between teenagers with supernatural powers\". For better or for worse, I Am Number Four belongs to this nascent sub-genus, and I found it to be boring and lacking of any emotion and originality.I Am Number Four covers a well-known ground from the fantastic cinema as well as from the juvenile romance one. And I am not precisely against of that; director D.J. Caruso previously made two unoriginal but dynamic and entertaining movies (Disturbia and Eagle Eye), something which gave me hopes of finding some redeemable elements in I Am Number Four. Unfortunately, very few things worked in this movie (at least in my personal experience), because I could never get interested in the characters or in their forced romance, and much less in the horribly trite sci-fi concepts with which it pretends to adorn its tiring narrative.To start with...Mogadorians? Was that the best name which came to mind to author Pittacus Lore (in fact a pseudonym of Jobie Hughes and James Frey) for the villains of the book on which this movie was based? Sure, the name by itself does not have too much importance, but it is a good example of the creativity level from the whole film. The heroes are handsome young people who look like models; the villains are bald and pale, with piranha teeth, and they suffer from the \"talkative villain syndrome\", revealing their plans or talking more than they should when they could easily exterminate the heroes.One of the few things I liked in I Am Number Four is Teresa Palmer\\'s energetic performance. In fact, I think the film would have been much more entertaining with her in the leading role, instead of the insipid couple of Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron. However, I cannot recommend this film, because I found it to be bland, repetitive and tedious.',\n",
       "  'Let\\'s try to go back to 2008. We got \"Eagle Eye\", It\\'s a mixture of various sci-fi flicks. Now we have \"I Am Number Four\". Yeah it\\'s based on a book, but everything you see is familiar. I just noticed most of Caruso\\'s sci-fi movies have clichéd ideas. Is it the writer\\'s fault? Some of the dialog is also generic. The special effects looks so homemade(look at the lasers). The actors have murmur problem. \"I Am Number Four\" is underrated in a bad way.If the nine aliens are so powerful, why can\\'t they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I\\'ve never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence.The action scenes? Well D.J. Caruso is good at one of those, but here it\\'s messed up. The special effects is so inferior it felt like they used Adobe After Effect(except those giant monsters but still looks cheap). The effects ruined the action of this film. Clashing unreal things and look at those colors. The lasers.The performances? Alex Pettyfer thinks he\\'s cool but he\\'s obviously not. Teresa Palmer is hot but she only kicks ass in the third act. Timothy Olyphant was disappointing. A pro actor playing a boring guardian.Overall \"I Am Number Four\" is as lifeless as \"Twilight\"(sequels). Or more lifeless I guess. The action scenes could have been better. The characters thinks they\\'re cool and awesome. They are dull actually. The rest is cliché. Generic. Etc. Is it worth watching? No. How about skipping the first and second act. The third act is the only entertaining part of the movie. But I\\'m warning you. It\\'s an easy generic forgettable film.',\n",
       "  \"An entertaining, visually fun film that misses out on the most important parts of a movie: the story and it's characters. I Am Number Four tells the story of the last remaining aliens from an extinct planet that are being hunted down and killed by the aliens that exterminated it. There are 9 teenage special aliens left and these are the ones that the bad aliens are after. These special aliens also have a guardian who was a warrior on their alien planet whose sole duty is to protect them. Oh, and these special aliens have abilities that range from moving object with their minds, super-human strength, invisibility, etc. Got all that. Because that alone make me have all kinds of questions that never get answered. The film follows, if you can guess, the Number Four alien, played by Alex Pettyfer, and his guardian, played by Timothy Olyphant.We are told that the first three aliens have already been killed and that Four is on the run with his guardian to Paradise, Ohio. There, he predictably gets tired of being told to hide in their house, so he starts to attend the high school, where he befriends the local nerd, falls in love with the star quarterback's ex-girlfriend, and of course fights with the star quarterback and the other jocks, meanwhile he starts to gain his abilities and strengths. All the while this is happening the bad aliens are closing in on them as well as a mysterious blonde girl. This all occurs over about an hour and fifteen minutes which really is a shame, because the last 30 minutes when the bad aliens and Four fight is extremely fun and entertaining. It's one of the better action scenes I've seen in a while, the big problem being it takes way too long for it to reach the screen.There are many problems with the story, but mainly they just leave way too many questions unanswered, and this is mainly because the whole film is set up for a franchise with multiple films. This is also what happens when you adapt a novel into a film, there's always going to be aspects left out, but you have to choose what's essential to the story and not, and the writers chose the wrong things. The cast really isn't anything to talk about, they just look good on screen but are essentially television actors, but it's not totally their fault they're working with that caliber of a script.Some of the good things about the film come mainly from D.J. Caruso. He knows what he's doing when it comes to teenage action movies. This isn't as good as Disturbia (whose success is mainly due to Shia LaBeouf), but he does what he can with the script and the action scenes are where he shines and pulls you out of the coma you've fallen in to. It was also kind of cool to see an action/science fiction film based around the high school scenario even though they missed the mark where others have succeeded, like The Faculty. Lastly, the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic, bald, covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth, carry some pretty cool weapons, and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.Overall, its not worth the $8 or more you'll have to spend to see it. If you want to sneak in for the last 30 minutes I would highly recommend that or just wait until Blu-Ray/DVD. If you've seen the show Smallville and Jumper it's essentially those 2 put together with a sprinkle of the Twilight movies. Caruso does his best with some very cool and entertaining action scenes but the script is just too bare and full of holes for him to save it. The same goes with the cast, even if they were all very talented actors I'm still not sure it would be a worthwhile movie. With all that being said I would probably go see the sequels because of the last action scene and just to see if some of my questions are answered or just save some money and read the books...\",\n",
       "  'This movie actually has an interesting story, a not entirely, but at least partly original idea. It should be a good movie about aliens hunting down other aliens on earthly settings. Well its not a good movie AT ALL. Oh boy is this one baaad...., this made me really angry... First of all, the main character is a totally unlikable little sissy boy. The actor has no talent at all he has like three facial expression: the \"I am messed up\"-look, the \"I am angry\"-look and don\\'t forget the \"awww I am totally like a cute puppy, are you girls feeling hawt already?\"-look and that\\'s about it. Not just the actor, but the character is unlikable too. He is supposed to be a survivor, a teen from another planet, who is super-duper strong and one of the last of his kind. And does he have a sense of nobleness or class? No. Does he have a sense of danger or urgency? No. When it is established that the same race, which destroyed his home, is out to kill him, does he listen to his mentor\\'s advice and stays home? OF COURSE NOT. He keeps whining, that he needs to blend in and stuff. When an entire group of outer-space assassins are out to kill you, and they already killed almost every single one of your race, don\\'t you have more pressing matters, than go to school and try to be the \"kool\" jet-sky flipping kid?.... For example, like... I don\\'t know...Planning to escape the situation? Train yourself for battle? Plan a revenge? Oh come on, that\\'s not so interesting for teenage girls......They want to see the UFO go to high school and jet-sky, because he is so hawt......So he shall do that...Its pretty bad when the only thing you can think of to do with your main character is blatant fangirl-service. Go ahead little fangirls get offended and rate me down for this, but this is PATHETIC. Oh and if you want to make another crappy \"nerds and jocks and love in high school with odd girl and hawt boy\" its okay, fine by me, BUT don\\'t LIE to me with a trailer like this movie had. The trailer promised an action packed sci-fi movie and 40 minutes into the film I had to listen to god awful dialoge about odd-girls photographing habits and even more awful scenes with odd-girls parents having little family dinners with UFO pretty boy...What the....??? I am sick and tired of these holly-jolly pink teenage love stories, please don\\'t try to force them down on my throat when I am promised to see a movie about aliens fighting for their lives. I could go on about how unimaginative all the aliens (good and bad alike) were, or how this movie had the most awkward dialogue I heard in years, or how stupid it is that after UFO boys little light-show on the beach or in the class-room nobody really cared. In reality after a show like that on a beach at night during a party, well it would draw much more attention and it would be in the news for days... But why talk about these things, this movie flat out lied about its intentions and it is sad and pathetic.',\n",

The first two minutes start out great, with a pulse-pounding scene that grabs you by the throat and gets you immediately interested, but it's all downhill from there. Having the revelation that the lead characters are aliens be given away so early in the film, in a terrible voice-over to boot, took most of the wind out of this movie's sails for me. The villains are over-the-top in a bad way, the dialogue is horrible, and is delivered by actors who seem to be trying their best for a while, but eventually seem to stop caring and give terrible performances as a result of the lack of material to work with. It felt like an hour and a half long bad Smallville episode, which seems about right since it's written by a former Smallville writer.\",\n",

       "  \"Lights Out is an interesting stab at a horror movie based on a 2013 short film of the same name. The movie's novel concept is a creature that can only be seen and manifest in the dark. Turn a torch on, and it disappears. Naturally, this means that a lot of the movie is spent in the dark but this works well.The use of lighting is one of the movie's strong points and allows for some creative, and occasionally funny, uses of torches, candles and even car headlights. This technique generates a lot of the scares and atmosphere and given the movie's title, this is a must. Definitely top marks for the director on this part.Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman do well in the lead roles as the unfortunate kids with a crazy mother, played by Maria Bello. The problem with the movie is that apart from its main concept, it doesn't add much else. Clichés abound and yes, there is the mandatory dark basement (groan). Most of the scares are jump-out-at- you shocks and it's all been done before. Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to use psychological horror and churns out movies that are just twists on the same theme. This is probably a bit harsh as the movie is enjoyable enough and it's well-written, but I long for something new that isn't so long in the tooth.The supernatural horror is effective and does elicit a genuine threat to the characters. Maria Bello, in particular, does well to ramp up the threat levels and makes you wonder who is going to make it out alive. As already mentioned, this was based on a short film and it really still is, coming in at around 80 minutes. Perhaps there wasn't enough material to make a longer movie but there's a feeling that it ends just as it gets going.Lights Out is a decent film if you feel the need for a dash of supernatural horror but don't expect anything stand-out; it just doesn't deliver enough of a impact to make it memorable. It's good for what it does but don't buy too much popcorn as you may not have time to finish it.\",\n",
       "  'This movie will get your pulse up fast, revealing the \"horror\" very early on. Interestingly enough, it keeps that pulse up throughout the movie despite of this. The concept of something that can only appear and be seen if it\\'s dark (and with a somewhat supernatural ability to destroy light bulbs) is bound to lead to a jump scare or ten whenever it appears. Towards the end you\\'ve almost gotten so used to it that the scare effect wears off a bit, and is one of two reason I don\\'t rank this a 10. But thanks to a good story and good actors, the movie still holds its ground to the very end.The characters are really good, well written and performed, and with a young boy that if not before, totally kick started his future acting career with this movie. Who doesn\\'t love a young prodigy? The plot has some weight and emotion to it, and with a solid ending that wraps things up in a much more satisfying way than most similar movies.The other small drawback with this movie for me was mostly because of slightly unrealistic behavior from our main characters, occasionally. Like when miss heels from Jurrasic World is worried that when she releases T-Rex it won\\'t be able to follow her if she runs. So, she waits for it to come close, walks for a bit, then runs. Those kinds of unrealistic behaviors. But I\\'ve seen much worse, and this movie doesn\\'t take the \"unrealistic\" very far, or often, so I suggest you just put this on and roll with it!All in all you get everything you want from a jump scare movie with Lights Out, with a good plot and good actors that deliver, and a scare factor we all can relate to. You might not be so happy with turning of your lights going to bed later that night, so if you have a weak stomach you might wanna sit this one out.',\n",
       "  \"Lights out\\x85 an eerie silhouette of a human-like creature loiters down the hall. You repeatedly blink in an attempt to mould its blurred lines, but the dishevelled contour of the unfathomable spectre remains absolutely motionless. Lights on\\x85 nothing there. Lights out\\x85 it's moved a couple of inches near you, and your breath starts to come in short gasps. Lights on\\x85 a tinge of stinging pain strikes your bloodshot eyes, and sweat covers your petrified face. You hesitatingly move your fingers upon the switch and take an abrupt stop in the middle to wonder what will happen the next time the lights go out. Well, let's see. Lights out\\x85 perhaps, you shouldn't have been so curious.In 2013, Swedish filmmaker, David F. Sandberg, put out one of the most iconic horror short-film experiences that the internet had ever experienced. By that time, all the corners of the virtual realm were awash with the amateurish spine-tingling stories, and the emergence of urban legends, such as The Slenderman. They galvanised aspiring writers to leave their marks on virtual forums, but a selected few decided to take their projects to a whole new level by transferring them to a wider scope.Lotta Losten, who played the nameless main character in the short-film version, enacts a below-par reinterpretation of the same scene, which filled our hearts with sheer dread on Youtube. This time, she plays a woman who works in a mannequin warehouse, and, while clocking out, happens to have a ghastly encounter with a ghoulish presence; However, she's able to sheer away from a gruesome fate. Subsequently, she warns her boss, Paul, about what she saw. He doesn't seem to give much thought to it, but later on, while walking down a dimly lit hall, he comes across a monstrous apparition, which drags him into the darkness, and mauls him to death.The story follows the brothers, Martin and Rebecca, trying to fathom the depression episodes of their mother, Sophie, who happens to have an unexplained connection with the same demonic entity, who attacked Paul, their stepfather. Rebecca is the typical rogue girl who's then telephoned by the school, where her brother studies, to talk about his sleeping in the class, of which he attributes to the same entity which happened to haunt his sister. Rebecca feels beholden to become his responsible guardian, inasmuch as her mother is not of sound mind to look after the boy, and that's when the very same monstrosity that traumatised her childhood, decides to lurk in the shadows of her bedroom one more time.Unfortunately, the adapted version falls short in offering an immersing narrative compared to the original one. The short-film is well-off for uneasiness. It relates to the blood-curdling sensation of going to the kitchen, in the middle of the night, to get a glass of water, and feeling that, at any moment, a gelid hand will sneak up on you. The foundations of the original piece are the imaginary phantasmal beasts, which are masterfully woven due to mere creaks and noises.The experience does not establish a favourable pace in order to evoke a heartfelt sympathy towards the characters. The film doesn't take too long to showcase its premise by walking us through its mechanics. A glowing lamp pops up in the screen signalling its importance in the narrative and it appears that the whole story is used as a mere background for its successful jump scares extravaganza. 'Lights Out' didn't seem to have inherited the same traces that its predecessor could have bequeathed, instead, it limits itself as a roller-coaster filled with jump scares that do not allow the viewer to take in the events. Notwithstanding, it does not entirely fail to regale us. The formula can be categorised as hackneyed, but gets its message effortlessly through to us by simply saying: Grab a torch and give darkness a wide berth. Lights Out\\x85 enjoy the ride.Verdict: 2/5\",\n",
       "  \"Lights out really is a great modern horror film. It offers great thrills and also offers wonderful acting. Every actor did their job beautifully and the characters they portray are well constructed, they are not just surface level, cardboard cut out characters. The visuals are good, the darkness and the creepy eeriness effect of a lot of scenes work very well. There are some scenes that may even be somewhat hard to watch because of the utter creepiness. Diana and the visuals that make her up are done very well and the horror is real here, it's not cheap or cheesily boring. The opening of the film is also very effective in its attempt to be truly scary. This movie isn't very gory or overly grotesque either, it has a minimal amount of blood/gore, and some violent images, but not a whole whole lot, which it good and a wise decision by the filmmakers, because if a scary movie is too gory or overly disturbing, then it can be distracting from the plot. You want people focused on the plot of the movie and on what's going on, not on the ridiculous amount of gore. Lights out receives an 8/10 on my scale.\",\n",
       "  'A man called Paul (Billy Burke) is working after hours and is murdered by a supernatural entity in the shadow. When his son, the boy Martin (Gabriel Bateman), is frightened by the same creature, he sees his mother Sophie (Maria Bello) talking to an imaginary friend called Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey) in the shadow of her room. Martin does not sleep anymore during the night but in classroom and his older stepsister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) that lives alone is summoned by the social assistant. She brings Martin home and recalls he own experience with Diana years ago when she was young. Sophie and her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) investigate the connection of Sophie with Diana and come up to a scary revelation about their past.\"Lights Out\" is a flawed horror film that startles the viewer. The high-quality production has top-notch cinematography, associated to a great cast highlighting the wonderful Teresa Palmer and Maria Bello. Unfortunately the story has many flaws and it is not well explained. For example, why the light burns Diana in the end (could it be because it was directed to her?) and not along the film?; or why Sophie\\'s suicide destroys Diana (was she creating the entity? Why?). Was Sophie having problems with her first and second husband? Or is just Diana\\'s jealousy. Or how it was explained to the police how Paul, two police officers and a housewife were mysteriously murdered. The writers could have been more careful with viewers that are not brainless. At least, in \"Der Fluch von Darkness Falls\" (a.k.a. \"Darkness Fall\"), the entity is better explained. But anyway it is worthwhile watching this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Quando as Luzes se Apagam\" (\"When the Lights Are Out\")',\n",
       "  'Lights Out, is quite possibly one of the most visually and mentally scary films in the last two years. The film is yet another in a string of horror movies that uses diseases as allegories for its premise, and this premise alone is genius. Lights Out is often unnerving and sometimes terrifying, dark in look and tone, without feeling recycled or derivative. The biggest strength of the film is that the story is constructed in a way that the audience is always wondering if something will happen.The most genius element of the film is the look of the creature that haunts this movie \"Diana.\" Diana is an all-black figure that lurks in the dark, and kills whoever threatens it. That being said throughout this film the audience has to fear that this character could pop out of any dark space at any given time. At 81 minutes, not a single second is calm or peaceful, because the mere sight of sight of this creature is unnerving. However, the writers and crew deserve credit for conceiving the idea of the film having a lot of darkness in it.We often say lighting is a storytelling device, but in today\\'s films it\\'s become less true the more formulaic films get. In this film lighting is very much a storytelling device, and it is used perfectly. Every scene in this film contains, just the right amount of darkness and light, almost as if there are safe areas, and areas that characters should stay away from, and they\\'re often changing. The dark look and tone of this film, create a very unnerving atmosphere, because one of the most common fears is a fear of the dark, and more notably a fear of the unknown, which exists in the dark.The film really hit a note with me personally, because I have had nightmares in the past about all dark figures living in the dark, so the film felt that much more personal to me. That being said, the film really doesn\\'t feel all that derivative of other recent horror films. A few moments, and scenes did feel familiar (Diana as a child), but those were few and far between. Even those moments that are a little familiar, are constructed in a way that they are still very scary. The film does what The Babadook did a couple of years ago, and uses depression as an allegory for the creature in the film, which is turning into a very cool concept. The film is one of the few films within the system that uses lighting to tell the story, and does so in a way that is clever and terrifying at the same time. The film is admittedly dark, and relatively humorless, and not really for children, but that kinda goes without saying. For those horror buffs looking for a good scary movie, this may be your movie.',\n",
       "  \"Lights Out takes some queues from Japanese-styled ghost stories, so it will be attractive to that audience. It has a strong chill-factor but a somewhat average formula, and it could have used fewer back-story explanations to make it more mysterious, especially since those elements did not feel original. Based on chill factor alone, it ranks higher than Dark Water, The Forest, Paranormal Activity, The Others, The Babadook, and The Boy, and lower than The Ring, Ju-On / The Grudge, and other Japanese-styled ghost stories, as well as any horror James Wan himself directs. Comparing it to masterpieces like The Exorcist and Poltergeist has no value. I would say its chills rank somewhat evenly with The Woman in Black and It Follows, without being as original as the latter.The ghost itself is creepy enough, but the overall movie didn't have the creative twists that we enjoyed from movies like The Boy, The Others, The Sixth Sense, and 10 Cloverfield Lane. It also didn't have the storytelling chemistry of James Wan's own Insideous or The Conjuring movies.I am a fairly difficult person to frighten. I have been seeing horror movies at the theater since the 70's, and I am usually only interested in the ones that have a supernatural or fantastical element to them. So I am very critical of them, and the only ones I collect on disc are either fun (Tremors), scary (the Grudge), or both (An American Werewolf in London). I will collect this one.Ghost stories are done to death. It is very difficult to come out with anything scary that is original. I think Lights Out could have used the guided hand of a third-party master horror writer, mostly revising the back-story revelations and using the character relationships to build suspense and mystery surrounding what is going on. Then, perhaps working up to a punch line at the end so that suddenly the back- story rushes in on the audience in one moment, with one simple revelation. It is very difficult to think of how that can be done, but other movies have done it, and the payoff is huge. I think Lights Out tried to do that a little but got confusing in the attempt. But all-in-all it's a nice little scary movie with a smaller production value but a satisfying ghost.\",\n",
       "  \"Lights Out doesn't break any new ground, nor does it really attempt to. 81 minutes of PG-13 jump scares and basic horror tropes in the vein of The Grudge. Not bad for a summer fright fest, but don't expect more as you won't find it here. Technically it looked and sounded great, with a notable crazy-mom performance from Maria Bello. If you've seen the director's original short you've basically seen this movie already, however if you're looking for a quick scare without a lot of substance this should do the trick. For a good storyline with stylish direction look elsewhere, as the missed opportunities pile up rather quickly with this one.\",\n",
       "  'The short is a fantastic example of a clever and well executed idea. It just works, so good, and I was super excited about the feature. So it hurts to say that the feature is far from the clever short. Why? They milk the concept bone dry in a couple of minutes. You get it all in the intro and everything after the title is just a downward spiral with a bunch of desperate attempts to keep it going. I hoped this could be a great feature version of the weeping angles from Doctor Who. If you haven\\'t seen that you should watch the episode \"Blink\" right now. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000252/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2Some of my favorite horror movies are the original Chainsaw Massacre, Blair witch project and The Evil Dead. What do they have in common? They leave a lot to your own imagination. You get bits and pieces of explanation but they never give too much. They let you fill in most of the blanks. Lights out wants to explain all of it and centers the whole story about that explanation. In that way they miss the thing that made the concept so good. The fear of the dark and the fear of the unknown. When they take that from us we\\'re left with jumpscares and predictable story lines.',\n",
       "  '***SPOILERS*** Lights out is one of those movie concepts that sounds really interesting on paper, but falls flat on its face and breaks its nose as soon as it starts moving.It\\'s a jump-scare filled slug that fails to impress, featuring a boring cast with no real personality, illogical decisions to try and make you jump, and a monster that doesn\\'t even follow her own rules.The massive problem is the star of the movie itself: Diana. She\\'s an evil woman that follows the mother of two kids, and relies on the mother suffering to survive her self. The problem with Diana is that she breaks her own rules all the bloody time. One moment she needs people to open the doors for herself, the next she\\'s teleporting around like she\\'s a god. In the next moment she might disappear when you flash a light at her, or she might decide to stand there and burn while screaming her lungs out.Diana herself doesn\\'t seem to have any real goal other than being a jerk. She needs the mother to be depressed or she disappears *supposedly* but then decides to hunt her kids when they\\'re trying to avoid her, which in theory she should be grateful for.Diana is also about as subtle as a Train wreck. Whenever she appears the music blats your ears in an attempt to scare you, but when you close your ears *since it\\'s always easy to predict where she will be* and just look at the scene, you realize Diana is about as scary as Mickey Mouse with fangs.Characters also do the stupidest of things, like walking TOWARDS where they know Diana might be, instead of staying in a lit area where they\\'re safe. And the excuse \"they don\\'t know better\" is not valid, since the entire family knows Diana is real, and has multiple scars and wounds to show from it.In conclusion, Lights out is a poorly thought out movie that would have been better off staying as a short film. The only real good thing about the movie is that none of the \"living\" characters are inhumanly bastards. Don\\'t waste your time.',\n",
       "  'This is what horror films should be like - focused on the scares, has really effective jump scares, even a few humor thrown in, and a not complicated story line that is very easy to follow.This is very much a very \"popcorn horror movie\" where it delivers the right scares & thrills. Maybe it was a little too short, but that\\'s okay compared to long horror movies that don\\'t really work.I found myself jumping/shouting/screaming a couple of times watching this in the movie theater and I assure you it was not because I just wanted to do it or due to the influence of peer pressure of everyone in the theater also jumping. And it has also impact beyond that, because you\\'d be thinking about this movie when you get home and you have to turn off the lights.It\\'s a very entertaining horror film and in my opinion, what horror films should be like (especially PG-13 horror films). \"PG-13 horror films\" can indeed be very effective in the right circumstances. Those people who are saying this is \"only scary\" because of the \"jump scares\" don\\'t understand effective jump scares when they see them.So bring your friends along with you and watch this in the cinema and you\\'ll be surprised.',\n",
       "  'Its brilliance lies in its simplicity. Lights out doesn\\'t attempt to confuse anyone, nor does it look to introduce a totally original idea. Instead, it boldly and unambiguously taunts the audience with the message, \"you were all afraid of the dark as kids and most of you still are.\" Never has a scary movie villain had such an easy foil—light. Literally any kind of light—sun, fluorescent, bright. They each work perfectly well. Shine any sort of light in the direction of this movie\\'s monster and she disappears. Poof. She\\'s gone and everyone is safe. Writing this, I recognize that this doesn\\'t sound even the tiniest bit scary. Yet somehow, as I sat in my well-lit house after watching the movie, I felt afraid. A brief telling of the plot: there\\'s a monster-demon-ghost-girl named Diana that lives only in darkness because light hurts her, and sometimes she kills people. She haunts other people in the movie who try to not be killed by her and also they try to defeat her. That\\'s really all there is to know. Yes, it\\'s a very simple plot, but still an enjoyable one, at least in this instance.Something about the beautiful simplicity of the scare tactics just worked. Nothing confusing, nothing shocking. There weren\\'t even very many classic hanging suspense moments interrupted by loud, jolt scares. These we textbook jump scares. A seemingly safe moment with normal amounts of sound that slowly drifts to silence then POW! A jump scare. You may be thinking, \"this sounds lame. How does this brutally basic approach yields effective scares?\" Great question, my astute and thoughtful reader. I\\'ve thought about this question and come up with a few explanations. First, we owe a tremendous credit to the actress who played Diana (Alicia Vela-Baley). Her intimidating posture and sickly contorting and Freddy Kruegerish flailing arms bring to life a terrifying character, whose mere presence on screen is enough to leave viewers unsettled. There\\'s something about crouching, and Vela-Baley is great at it. Seeing a person crouch in a well-lit area is comical. But looking at a crouching figure in the shadows, that will make your skin crawl. The other explanation that I will offer is the visceral nature of the scares. Much of the movie takes place in the dark and the dark is scary. We are evolutionarily predispositioned to fear the dark. It\\'s a survival instinct. Don\\'t argue with me on this. I\\'m right. Anyway, the dimly-lit, shadowy settings are the perfect playground for visceral and pure jump scares. Director David F. Sandberg hits all the right beats in framing and lurking camera movement to maximize this simple and smart approach. So, that\\'s it. If you can\\'t stand jump scares or scary movies, don\\'t see Lights Out. Honestly, I\\'m not sure why you\\'re even reading this review if you don\\'t like scary movies. If you do like jump scares and scary movies, watch Lights Out. And maybe buy a couple extra lightbulbs or a nightlight before you do.',\n",
       "  \"This movie is great. It immediately engages and then keeps the audience's attention. The story is compact, the acting strong and ending plausible. Perhaps the strongest performance is that of Marie Bello, who plays an emotionally disturbed woman. However, all of the performances are outstanding. The movie succeeds in creating a mood of foreboding as all are engaged in a fight for survival against an unknown malevolent force. The movie avoids the pitfall of becoming just another scary movie with contrivances that inspire laughter. Instead, it succeeds in telling a story and building the tension to its inevitable climax. That is the hallmark of excellent story telling and why this movie is worth watching.\",\n",

The only part that I didn\\'t like was they did the explanation of the backstory by one character explaining it to another. I always hate when they do that, just seems lazy.The audience really got into it with a lot of people jumping and then a lot of giggles at themselves and others for jumping. Oh and in our screening the comedic relief of the big guy down front yelling \"oh s**t\" every time Diana jumps out. It reminded me of when I was a young teen and we\\'d get a whole group to go see the newest horror (F13,Halloween etc)You can\\'t take it too seriously, just sit back and enjoy it.Overall I\\'d give it a 8/10 which is pretty good for a horror flick.',\n",

I will try and keep this review as spoiler free as possible..the beginning scene is extremely anticlimactic. the director does a great job of building some solid tension and some genuine sense of unease with this first sequence but the pay off was such a major let down. a character is pulled laughably into the darkness. unfortunately this is the only scene that built any tension at all. for the entire duration of the rest of the movie there is no tension what so ever. every \"scare\" is predictable and laughable. characters who know and have known for a long time that you have to stay in the light to escape this ghost foolishly hold their lights in front of them. pointing the light away from them rather than holding the light above their heads. so many scenes involved characters surrounded by darkness, holding a light in front of them and backing into the darkness. so anticlimactic and boring to watch. this ghost has the power to rip someone into the darkness and do away with them immediately.. so why does it not do this to these characters that it wants out of the picture. instead it chooses to show up and grab their shoulders, or stand in the doorway or something equally as ridiculous. for one half of the movie the ghost instantly disappears when the light hits it. but in the third act suddenly for no apparent reason at all the light burns her? there was no explaining this is just suddenly happened. the characters have the opportunity to delve into their past and really develop and maybe even have an arc. instead we get generic characters with minimal motivation and a very very vague and uninteresting back story. the exposition in the film is also ridiculous. there is a scene where Rebecca walks in and just meets this lady for the first time in her life and within seconds she says something along the lines of \"stepfather not my father. my father abandoned me.\" who says that? who says that within seconds of meeting someone? it\\'s like the director has such difficulty introducing us to these characters and their back stories that he writes them with out any thought or any heart. I will not reveal much about the story but I will just say it is the most generic story-line possible. the potential was there to write an interesting mystery but instead the ball was dropped. we get a generic, mom met a girl. the girl died because of some unjust cause and now the girl is back in ghost form. nothing interesting and you see it coming from a mile away. the acting is awful. I couldn\\'t take anybody In the movie seriously. the interactions between characters all seem so forced and unnatural.there really isn\\'t anything about the movie that was redeemable. I went into it hoping i\\'d like it. but no. the only thing I could give it as a positive would be the fact that it\\'s well made. but the budget was obviously the reason for that. if somebody gave me millions of dollars to make a movie i\\'m sure it would look and sound just as good.it had a pretty good concept but unfortunately the ball was dropped. nothing interesting or even slightly different was done and the film ended up being a stale and boring one.2/10',\n",
       "  'It wasn\\'t until I checked the credits that I realized this was based off of the short film by David F. Sandberg. I knew the lights off/lights on shadow figure thing seemed familiar. While I really loved the short film, I don\\'t necessarily agree that it needed the full length treatment. I feel like we see this a lot - capitalize off some popular internet thing that, when extended, loses some of what made it special in the first place. The short film was unsettling and creepy as it was; giving it a back story and more detail made it feel cheapened. I\\'m not a huge fan of \"BOO!\" gotcha horror movies, though; I come from a generation that was raised on the original Halloween and, for me, that is the apex of subtle, creepy, slow burn etc - everything that makes one get enveloped in a movie. When there are two many jump-atchas, it is jarring and does not make for high replay value (for me, anyway). I thought the mental asylum backstory was so played out; I feel like maybe that trope should be burned alive. We get it. Although that\\'s kind of how I also feel about kids being creepy (or \"troubled\"), too. There\\'s just so little variation in horror these days. Not all bad, though - I feel like the choice of Teresa Palmer as Maria Bello (Sophie)\\'s character\\'s daughter was a fantastic choice. I not only enjoyed her performance but I feel she looks the part; she looks like a younger version of her.',\n",
       "  \"I was looking forward to seeing LIGHTS OUT in the theatre. I'm always interested when an amateur director of a promising short is offered the chance to make a feature film out of his neat, little idea. For anyone who hasn't seen the shortfilm LIGHTS OUT by David F. Sandberg on which this movie is based, go check it out, it's on Youtube. It's funny and creepy at the same time and develops quite a charme in just 3 minutes.However, i have to say, when it comes to the full lentgh version of the film, it is simply not more than an above average horrorflic that definitely shows a potential in a young director who hopefully hones his skills in his projects. Compared to most other horrorfilms of late, LIGHTS OUT is definitely better than works like ANNABELLE, OUIJA, THE WOMAN IN BLACK 2, SINISTER 2, INSIDIOUS 2+3 or THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, but sadly this doesn't say all too much. Those Assembly-Line-Horrorfilms simply suck. It is also not quite on the same Level as 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE, THE BABADOOK or IT FOLLOWS, let alone the cinematic powerhouses of the last century.What I liked about the movie is the cinematography and the building of tension. The camera work isn't very dynamic, but the scenes are always crisp and clear. The angles are well chosen. The play with light and shadow is very creative and leads to moments that are tense as well as funny, e.g. in the scene where a red neon light is shining in intervals through the window of Beccas bedroom and the creature only shows itself when said light is switched off. All the horror scenes are well directed and even the occasionally thrown in jumpscares suit the situations mostly well. It's a constant back and forth between the chilling, tense absence of the creepy creature and the terror that unfolds when it finally shows itself. The horror aspect of LIGHTS OUT definitely works.However, the framework that holds everything together is simply underwhelming due to a boring script and a lack of experience when it comes to direct emotionally charged character interaction. The characters in the film are likable (especially Beccas boyfriend, who's struggling hard to convince her to open up to him and is very sympathetic in his clumsiness and earnestness) and we spend quite some time to just learn about them, but the movie doesn't do much with it. Especially when you consider that the movie is about a terrifying monster that comes across as scary and brutal in the well realized opening, the rest of the film is simply too harmless, undisturbing and shallow. Everything boils down to a very simple family drama without ever delving too deep into the regions of mental disorder or the disruption of family ties upon which the film touches. Also, for the most time, everything that the creature does is nothing more than a clawed hand shooting out of the dark and grabbing at one of the protagonists.Additionally, the creature seems to be quite stupid. It's motivation is - as is revealed about half into the movie - to be left alone. However, when it seeks out Becca in her apartment, revealing its presence to her and even scratching its name into the floorboards, it does provoke exactly the opposite. Also, the backstory of the creature is delivered in rather lame exposition and is overall pretty messy. The script could have done a way better job at presenting an engaging mystery here.So overall, LIGHTS OUT manages to provide short, effective and tense moments of horror and develops at least characters that are likable. That makes it entertaining to watch but overall pretty forgettable. It's never really bad, but also lacks moments that are really memorable (apart from the scene with the car keys, that one was awesome). Thus, I enjoyed it, but I probably do not have to see it again anytime soon.\",\n",

It is really pretty. The cast are pretty, the sets are pretty. The light is pretty, the intro is pretty. After the intro, the movie is pretty...... ..dumb.And not \"horror-dumb\" kind of way, rather dumb in a \"this is plain dumb\" way.The decisions the characters make, the lame and way-too-much-straight-into- your-face expositions. The jump scares that made no sense. The lack of character development. It all made me yawn at about 1/3rd of the movie. And later on was only worse. The dialogues, the music/sound effects, the monster, the reveal, the lack of character depth made me wish for them to die, rather the opposite. The ways to fight the monster back were ridiculous. And the ending? The dumbest ending I have seen in a long time.Christ, this movie made me angry. So promising and yet - ultimate letdown.Rent it. Or not. Better not.',\n",

The fact that it is unable to hit the 1hr 30min mark should have warned me there was little substance and I did not find myself invested in the characters or the unveiling of the truth behind the situation. On a sidenote, there was not much to look forward to with the scariest moments already portrayed in the trailer as well. Terribly mediocre.',\n",

This movie hit the spot from the acting which was sub-par from the evil entity. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Most people should really give it a try it is worth the money for sure. The film is only 85 minutes which was a downfall but I will take it versus a 2 hour horror movie that is boring till no end.

Usually I go into PG-13 horror films with low expectations, which allowed me to enjoy the movie for what it is: a bunch of jump scares. The short film this movie was based off was simple, and effectively scary. By adding so much to the concept, it threw off the pacing. This film tried to be more than what is was. It tried to explore a deeper meaning, touching on mental illness and family problems (think The Babadook but not nearly as good), but it only managed to scratch the surface in a pretty shallow and uninteresting way. This was only accentuated by sub-par acting from quite a bit of the cast.However, the film succeeded in making Diana frightening. By not ever showing her real form for much time outside of the shadows, she managed to be pretty horrifying. Definitely a creature to inspire nightmares when you turn out the lights.Overall it was fun to go see in a theater filled with jumpy teenagers, but not really worth a second watch.\"],\n",
       " ['A Gen Z update to Kathryn Bigelow\\'s 1991 cult classic, this remake is essentially an episode of Fast and Furious in which the vehicular exploits have been replaced with an assortment of extreme sports sequences. Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer\\'s truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer\\'s dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like \"the only law is gravity\" and \"everyone dies, it\\'s just a matter of how\", it\\'s nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can\\'t be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences, yet they\\'re not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller.',\n",

Unfortunately, in between all of those moments is a pretty boring plot line with characters that you never really care about.If you like mindless action (nothing wrong with that) then you will probably like this movie - although most of the \"action\" is extreme sports, not really guns.Apparently I have to write at least ten lines of text, but honestly there isn\\'t much more to say about the movie!',\n",
       "  \"Beware people, this is an early review. Being a member of a media group I caught an early screening at the Amc. I was not required to sign an NDA.Point Break is a bafflingly unsolicited remake of the 1991 cult classic of the same name. It is directed by Ericson Core, a good filmmaker who directed the 2006 Invincible, a film which is criminally underrated. When I found out that Point Break was being remade I shuddered in fear, but I when I learned that Core was directing the film, I immediately changed my tune, as I hold Invincible in such high regard, as it truly is an under appreciated film for the ages.Point Break 2015 is grotesque. I am not inherently adverse to remakes and reboots, and I am not at all a purist, I am perfectly fine with rebooting material and straying from source material if it serves the story well. What had happened here is that the studio has produced a garden variety action movie and slapped a name on it purely for the sake of brand recognition.The film exceeds expectations in the sense that this a slickly produced action film with a completely rad soundtrack. The camera work, framing and editing leave everything on the proverbial field. There isn't anything new going on here, but it's produced in a professional manner and the action scenes are handled with extreme care.And along comes the story, instead of our group of guys pulling bank jobs to fund adrenaline junkie lifestyles, the action men of 2015 are self aware crusaders, too cool for school, hipsters on a self imposed mission from God. Every character in this film is ball- kickingly annoying. The problem is that not one of the main characters are in possession of a redeemable quality and their motivations are completely nonsensical, they are all essentially unknowingly pseudo intellectuals.If this movie had been titles virtually anything else I may have given it a 4 or 5 out of 10, rather than a three, though the unnecessarily and intentionally sanitized PG13 vibe completely disrupts any potential the film may have had in the first place.It's not good, it stinks.No sir, I don't like it.\",\n",
       "  'I was enthusiastically exuberant about returning to what I\\'ve known as a cult classic, the original \"Point Break\".

I very seriously doubt that after two hours from getting out of the theater watching this, that anybody would even remember the name\\'s of the central characters in this film. Why, because the film maker neglected to give us a story where the characters are expounded and fleshed out beyond the 3 minutes for any resolute back-story on any of them. I appreciate the stunts and stunt people for their quality work involved, but stunts don\\'t make a movie. A good story, with quality characters that are inter-meshed with emotions and plots that pull the viewer into the characters\\' world is what makes a memorable film. I\\'ll stick with the original \"Point Break\".',\n",

I'm amazed that it was allowed to be put out to the cinema in its form. Nobody but the stunt team can get credit here. Similar stunts can be seen in a more realistic form by a simple You Tube search. Please don't watch this. The lines in this movie are so bad you would laugh if you were not so angry. I can't believe it obtained a rating of 5 on IMDb. 1 at best.\",\n",
       "  'Imagine the intense stunts from energy drink commercial or Youtube extreme sport montage while music from Mad Max blares on background. This is where the second coming of Point Break truly excels. When it hits just the right velocity, it\\'s bloody breathtaking. Unfortunately, the narrative is not only poor, it nearly sabotages the movie like a broken parachute.Story revolves around Utah (Luke Bracey), an FBI trainee as he investigates a series of heists and their connection to a group of athletes led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez). As one might expect, it follows the same trail that Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze has placed. The new leads do what they can, although it\\'s better to watch this without comparing, because it certainly doesn\\'t have the same caliber of star or chemistry.The plot then dives head first into uncharted territory. It\\'s littered with so much \"save the planet\" preachy acts as the writing struggles to place FBI agent in the hippie nirvana angle. The motivation is just a mess of random vague one-liners, even the on-screen characters are perplexed by it. There\\'s a romance subplot, but this is mainly to show the attractive Teresa Palmer as eye candy for several short scenes.The movie is actually better when they just show the crazy sequences instead of forcing its lackluster story. It has plethora of impressive feats, from high heaven wingsuit flying, the climb on hazardous urban streets and natural cliffs, to the surfing of gigantic waves. This is the level of stunt choreography xXx and Fast and Furious wish they had.When camera pans into the right angle and lighting, as the sounds is muffled by throbbing tune of the fast music, Point Break reaches the zenith. It\\'s miles beyond what typical action flick could offer, but sadly it\\'s repeatedly interrupted by the shoddy story, which feels like an excuse to fly across the globe to do random cool tricks.If viewed only on the grand mix of cinematography and choreography, Point Break is exquisite, this would have been a great documentary of extreme sport. However, as action movie, the story is so pretentious, it simply serves as speed bump to hamper the thrill.',\n",

I\\'ve never seen the original movie, so I have no bias towards it. Based on the movie\\'s own merit\\'s, the Point Break remake is laughably awful. In Point Break, a rookie FBI agent tracks down a group of extreme athletes who go around the world carrying out crimes in unusual and life-threatening ways; they plan to do a series of near- impossible stunts called the Ozaki 8 in hopes of reaching spiritual enlightenment. At least, that was the plot for about ten minutes before the movie devolves into a series of party scenes and surprisingly dull extreme sports clips that could have been easily viewed on YouTube, all set to irritating club music. It takes a special director to make BASE jumping and cliff diving this boring. Ericson Core builds as little suspense as possible in his action set pieces and instead films admittedly well-shot highlights reels for the action scenes. Any sort of suspense conjured up is because of the great cinematography because the characters are so flat and annoying that you almost wish they would get killed off. Everyone in this movie acts stoned out of their mind. All they do is spit faux- philosophical nonsense which gets tiring after the first twenty minutes. It gets laughable towards the end of the movie with lines like \"Ideas are strong. But not as strong as a whaling ship,\" and no amount of context will make that line any less ridiculous. The unbearable dialog, muddled plot and dull characters makes this Point Break remake utterly pointless. If you\\'re not a fan of remakes, this will make you reach your breaking point.',\n",

It is as if the director wanted to create the horrible anti point break. Oh My God! Oh My Buddha! Wasted life! There is no logic, the characters are half-dimensional, the star is beyond ridiculous and annoying, the girl is on drugs, the pace is awful they jump from scene to scene like monkeys jump from tree to tree.

       "  'The original Point Break was mostly known for its memorable bromance between Utah and Bodhi and some of its greatest action scenes ever put to film. Either way, this remake doesn\\'t bring enough justice to the cult classic. Its new approach, instead of a simple undercover cop thriller, is now a globe-trotting adventure featuring daredevils who are pulling off a grand stunt show. Though the stunts are impressive at times, it still pales in comparison with the original. The characters are bland, the plot makes no sense and every moment it tries to replicate with the original is just painfully forced for the sake of what they believe it\\'s called \"fan service.\" Therefore, there isn\\'t much reason for Point Break (2015) to exist.So Point Break is now about the stunts, but just like most action movies today, it also had to strip away personality. So whenever we see the cops, and even the daredevils, interact, it\\'s just not so entertaining. One of the charms of the original, while it had some great action sequences, even the characters are interesting to watch. Even if it\\'s trifle, it\\'s still worth spending your time. Now, it somehow becomes uninteresting filler, especially the love interest. Remember when Utah had to lie about his backstory to earn her trust? Well, now they just easily hook up and nothing else, until some twist happens or something like that. Utah and Bodhi aren\\'t as engaging, either. They\\'re mostly spewing exposition, while Bodhi is basically acting like a parody of someone from a New Age religion. Their intention of becoming Robin Hoods is kind of vague as well, but I guess no one thinks it actually matters.What\\'s really worth groaning is when it\\'s really trying to replicate the original; not by heart or personality, but by scene. They did the Ex- Presidents, even though one of them is wearing an Obama mask despite of taking place in 2015, but they only did it once, probably because there isn\\'t much room for this fan service. Also the iconic scene involving Utah shooting up the air, which apparently Hot Fuzz did it better. And the epilogue is horrendously shoehorned, like it\\'s nothing more than a tip off the hat, because... it\\'s not Point Break without it, I guess?However, there are some things to at least like in this film. The action is kind of stunning; the fact that they\\'re visually more realistic to look at than most CG-fest that blockbusters tend to feed us (except for the epilogue which is too obvious.) Maybe the best among them is the rock climbing sequence where it goes from wide shots to dirty hand shots of seeing how much they\\'d grip. Luke Bracey isn\\'t quite bad as an action hero, but he seriously needs a better material than this. Edgar Ramirez is probably just stuck with a blandly written Bodhi and really stays stick-in-the-mud with whatever he says about nature. Ray Winstone, though a good actor, is just not the memorably delightful Papas that Gary Busey established. And the movie wouldn\\'t be any different if Teresa Palmer\\'s role was written off.And Point Break (2015) is just another needless remake. There are ideas that could have been utilized more, but it\\'s too burdened by both action movie clichés and the fact that it is being Point Break. It\\'s not a good undercover cop thriller, nor a good bromantic film. And you better off watching an actual stunt show, which at least doesn\\'t make you get through to its drab expositions and the fact that it\\'s more real and not embellished by any special effects. Then again, the effects aren\\'t bad, but that\\'s not the point. You may give it credit for heightening something from the original, but it doesn\\'t do that well either. The fact how unnatural the homages are made for this remake makes it even more frustrating to watch.',\n",

It's basically a bunch of extreme sport stunt shots glued together with nonsensical storyline, bad acting and awful script.It's one of those movies that's so bad they can't even keep basic details straight, such as they drive off a boat at night time for a swim, but it's clearly daytime once they get underwater.There are some scenes that have literally no bearing on the story at all...such as the scene at the pier when the FBI UK guy is randomly pulling a boat out of the water.The time-line of just about every event makes no sense at all.The characters have nothing at all about them; they all seems to merge into one hipster bearded blob on the screen and the only way i managed to tell them apart was from their color coded outfits.\",\n",

The premise of the film sees a young up and coming FBI agent looking to infiltrate a gang of extreme athletes who may also be criminals. Luke bracey plays johnny Utah in this film and this is potentially one of the most stoic characters of the year and you will not care about him at all. His character is just so uninteresting that it really kills every scene that he is involved in. Edgar Ramirez plays bowdie in this film and just like bracey he is very stoic and isn't an interesting character like his previous incarnation. He is just your generic bad guy that Doesn't have any of the depth to him that you want him too. Also their chemistry Together just doesn't work and you just really do not buy it at all. The rest of bowdies crew were just as boring as he was and you won't care about there relationships with Utah as the film develops. The only performances I liked were ray winstone and Utah's police captain who I thought were both decent additions but they aren't given enough to do in this film for you to really care. The story is completely non existent, it is less compelling because the characters and their relationships are so dull and unbelievable that you will not care about anybody or anything in the film. The script has absolutely no depth to it and none of the dialogue was gripping in anyway. The style had some really cool extreme sports that are really well filmed but I don't need to watch this film to watch to watch good extreme sports so it needs to do more an the film just doesn't do anything more. Overall this film is definitely not worth a watch and go and watch the original point break because it is so good.\",\n",
       "  \"Let's put aside the asinine logic that went into the decision to remake Point Break to begin with. Let's just focus for a moment on whether or not they produced a good movie, regardless of whether it was an original idea or not. When we do that I think most of us can agree they failed miserably. This is a boring, unengaging movie in every way. The two leads are lacking in any charisma or appeal. They are both just so dull and lifeless I cannot begin to understand how they were cast in an action movie, let alone a remake of a superior action movie with two leads that played well off each other. But these two being so boring fits the tone of the film, one of the more unexciting excuses for an action movie I've ever seen. The original Point Break was a fun movie. This thing is dire and seems to believe it has a message, which makes it even worse. It's really just a lackluster movie all around. I guess the one positive it has over the original is that Teresa Palmer is nice to look at and the original movie just had Lori Petty.\",\n",
       "  \"Point Break marks another blockbuster fizzer from Warner Bros., who after several flops is now in desperate need of a major hit. This is a useless, money-grabbing exercise that rides the name of an already overrated cult film as an excuse to stage pointless stunts. I'll say this once: do not waste your money on this film. If you are a fan of the original Point Break by Kathryn Bigelow, the film where Patrick Swayze played a bank robbing surfer who took Keanu 'I am an FBI agent' Reeves under his wing, watch that film again. If you are in the mood for crazy stunts and set pieces, open YouTube and watch some extreme sports videos on there. These are comparatively sound alternatives to this dreck, courtesy of director Ericson Core who has made his first film since 2006. It might take another nine years and extensive therapy to overcome this stain. The film is so bad and amateurishly composed that it appears someone first listed off a series of extreme stunts and told Core and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (Salt) to write the movie around them no matter how jarring or ill-fitting they may seem. If you're still wondering, the stunts don't work on their own because the script's lousiness makes them boring since there's no investment in the one- dimensional characters and the weak performances of the actors.No thought went into planning this narrative. It starts with two motocross riders jumping between rock faces. One of them is Utah (Australian actor Luke Bracey), who watches as his friend falls to his death. The film forwards seven years to when Utah has joined the FBI and is under the watch of Instructor Hall (Delroy Lindo), who doubts Utah's commitment and calls him son a lot. Since Utah was once a motocross rider in the extreme sports circle, he magically has the background information about the activity of the dangerous gang of extreme sports criminals Hall is chasing. It's mega stupid and as contrived as the stunts themselves. The gang, best described as a hodgepodge of philosophers, hippies, extremists and Mountain Dew sports stars, is performing a ritual called the Osaki 8. The Osaki 8 involves eight different extreme sports trials, some of which are criminal activities but others are plain stunts including surfing and mountain climbing. The transition between these set pieces is embarrassing. When Utah bombs out in an early surfing attempt, the gang saves him from drowning by bringing him onto their boat. He's recognised as a famous motocross rider from all those years ago but everyone, at least at this point, is oblivious that this not-exactly-inconspicuous surfer dude has been training as a cop and is allowed to freely explore the boat of the gang leader Bodhi (Joy's Édgar Ramírez). The other members of the gang, including Teresa Palmer as a brief love interest, barely register at all so you won't give two hoots about them and they aren't even smart enough to background check Utah before initiating him. More criminal than the stunts is how Ray Winston as Utah's partner Pappas, a potentially good replacement for Gary Busey's comic relief character, is inconsequential through much of the film except when questioning if Utah is overly enjoying the gang life. But since we don't care about the other gang members, what's the point in blurring the two lines of the law?Does every blockbuster have to be self-serious now because it worked so well in the Nolan Batman films? Whereas Bigelow's film meshed action and comedy, this remake doesn't have a funny side at all. Instead, Bodhi's long, boring monologues about giving back to the earth (what?) are serious delusions this film has about becoming meaningful. But even watching the film solely for the stunts is futile. The film's marketing has emphasised how the stunts are performed by actual stuntmen as opposed to employing special effects. But given the stunts often have nothing to do with the gang's criminal activities, like the surfing, gliding and snowboarding sequences, we're watching a stunt showcase that's completely aloof from the plot. Similarly, the apparent realism of the stunts is malarkey since some are about as plausible as a Looney Tune's cartoon. Driving down mountain slopes ahead of an avalanche, through a dense forest on bikes and climbing mountains with just his bare hands will make you think that the FBI has really intensified its training or Utah has spent a lot of time with the Avengers. The only good things about the film are its brief reference to the bank robber masks of the original and that this boring pile falls under the two hour mark. It's a small victory for anyone who is foolish enough to pay money to see it. I lied and will reiterate: don't pay money to see this because you're only encouraging movies like this with boring action and such carelessness towards the story. It's a black eye to the fans of the original who might have given this disaster a chance.\",\n",
       "  \"The original was a great movie with classic actors. Sure it's dated today, but still carries it's own weight. This movie while containing some visually stunning cinematography, some how manages to just drag and drag. As others have commented it comes of like a commercial. The special affects don't seem that special. It's like you are watching a commercial with snowboarding and sky diving designed to sell Redbull. While I should be in awe at what they are doing on screen, i find myself yawning and wondering when is it all just going to end. There is no real tension building, no sense of fear that Utah will be discovered, unlike the original, where his cover was about to be blown with each scene. I highly recommend passing on this one, it's a borefest.\",\n",
       "  \"Point break (the 2015 remake) is the single worse remake in the history of remakes. The original point break was a solid B rated movie making this remake at best an F. I mean I've seen a lot of remakes and this is the worst movie I've ever seen. In fact I honestly felt relieved when the credits started rolling. Its funny because they want ten lines just to leave a review. While I could see this working on the average movie this doesn't not work for Point Break (2015). The movie is so bad there's few words that can express this. I feel like a teacher is wanting me to write something positive about the end of the world. There is nothing positive about it or this movie. On the plus side I've drug this on to the ten required lines and I can put the movie behind me and pretend I didn't waste part of my life watching it. Its too late for me, but please save yourself and don't watch this movie.\",\n",
       "  'Sometimes mere words cannot describe something adequately, and in the case of 2015\\'s utterly pointless and mind dumbing/daft Point Break remake there are quite literally no words I can summon from the shelves of my undoubtedly mediocre storage system of the English language to pinpoint just how idiotic, stupid and unintentionally hilarious this film is.Making Kathryn Bigalow\\'s well-liked 1991 original seem like a work of Shakespeare, Ericson Core\\'s update of the relatively simple story of fun-loving FBI agent Johnny Utah infiltrating a group of extreme sports enthusiasts that happen to be criminals is here turned into some type of \"giving back to nature\" eco conscious athletes that just happen to like messing with the rich corporations ruining mother nature (don\\'t even try to understand the Osaki 8 that keeps popping up here) and Johnny Utah is turned into a clearly Australian, motocross riding, badly tattooed (seriously how many tattooed people can be in one movie?) agent that gets to to be involved in one of the most hilarious on screen deaths in some time (in the film\\'s opening 5 minutes!) and somehow possesses even less charisma than Keanu Reeves (yes, the unthinkable has occurred). But if you think lame motocross related deaths and dodgy eco warriors are the worst of this films problems, then think again.Director Core and his team seemingly sat down at a table and in the space of 30 or so minutes designed a serious of supposedly breathtaking stunts that span the globe and while they look great in a location sense, the actual transpiring of events are so downright unbelievable that any sense of fun or excitement is taken away by the fact it\\'s just too daft to care.From downhill snowboarding, random unnecessarily dangerous rock climbing, perfectly used wing suit fly byes, an exploding rock strewn mountain face and perhaps worst of all, a reimaging of the wave clad finale of the original, Point Break seems intent on becoming some type of hybrid of Fast and the Furious but forgets to make sure that the occurrences happening here are indeed fun and frenetic, rather than overdone and frequently unengaging.At the end of the day one could go on and one about the many failures of Point Break but none of it comes as a surprise, as from the moment this remake was announced and then from the very first glimpses of the films atrocious trailer no one expected this waste of $100 million dollars plus to be anything more than a disposable piece of Hollywood trash. With no heart, no soul and with a bunch of uninvolving characters, this film is a waste of time that gets a bonus mark for its intrigue factor as a solidified sunken ship, it\\'s just a shame it took down two up and coming Australian actors in the form of Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer with it.1 mink blanket out of 5',\n",
       "  '\"Point Break\" is what \"Crusty Demons\" ought to be. Unfortunately, it is not what \"Point Break\" ought to be. In fairness, the extreme sports scenes are pretty awesome. The cinematography is crystal-clear and the exotic locations are picturesque. As an extreme sports video, it excels. As an action movie or caper, it is less impressive. The greatest problem is that none of the characters are particularly likable or charismatic. Personally, I think one major problem is the horrendous tattoos that most of the central characters sport over much of their bodies. Having worked as a photographer and cinematographer, I am no fan of tattoos. To me, they suggest low-class, criminal background, lack of self-respect and many other negative character traits. There are some tattoos that are inoffensive, even impressive – but not in this movie. When I see these tattoos, my first reaction is that I have never been that drunk or that stupid or uncultured. In the original, Bodhi\\'s crew had goals and motives that made sense. Here, we have a group of athletes with improbable skills, all of whom share an exotic philosophy and a disdain for profit. The surf Nazi red herrings are gone, as is Utah\\'s need to acquire skills in order to join the group. The whole Utah-Bodhi bromance seems less credible and less compelling. The antagonists are cast as eco-warriors; however, somehow it doesn\\'t make them sympathetic. They are financed by an eccentric multi-billionaire, which seems more contrived than organic. At one point, the FBI had very strict standards for its agents. They were expected to dress and conduct themselves in conformance with relatively conservative standards. The notion that the FBI would accept a long-haired, extensively tattooed candidate stretches credulity to the limits, as does much of the rest of the film. However, as a direct-to-video extreme sports video, it would be quite impressive.',\n",
       "  'When you go to the cinema to see an action movie, usually you do not expect something really engaging. Most of such productions do not appear as very original nor extraordinary. Although, from time to time, we can also find some surprising scores, wchich rebuild our ruined fate in greedy Hollywood producers. They go down into our memory. Many times, we want to re-watch them again, again and again one more time. One of such movies is Kathryn Bigelow\\'s \\x84Point Break\" from 1999. Unfortunately, same words can\\'t be said about the Core\\'s Newest \\x84Point Break\" by Ericson Core is such a schematic and predictable, as every movie created only for visual effects, wchich have been so important for screenwriters. However, the plot seems to be only a minor supplement. Who cares, right? So, what do we get here? A threadbare story, wchich tries to stole as much as it\\'s possible from the original. Young FBI agent, with embarrassing past, must infiltrate the mysterious organization suspected of many crimes, committed with the help of their amazing sport skills. Do you fill familiar with this description? By replacing some words, you could easily come with a conclusion that many action movies are the same, for example \\x84The Fast and the Furious\" and also Bigelow\\'s \\x84Point Break\". Thanks to the forceful action sequence pictures and technics how they were taken, we may partly forget about mediocre plot. It looks like, Core hasn\\'t known about that. And he probably still doesn\\'t. Because of that, his \\x84Point Break\" is more condensed around crass plot, rather than around extreme sports.Such things like crazy and dangerous stunts on surfboards and snowboards, motocross rides and jumps from planes have been reduced to minimum. These are a few scenes, wchich have turned out really all right. It shouldn\\'t be a big surprise, because Core was a director of photography at such productions as \\x84The Fast and the Furious\" and 2003\\'s \\x84Daredevil\", what gave him a necessary experience in this field. Although, it doesn\\'t mean, that he should have neglected all the other features of the movie like good plot or characters. All of these features are only the caricatures of their archetypes from 1999, without any natures, starred by the stiff actors. They look more like the sect of insane ecologists, rather than a division of athletes.New version of \\x84Point Break\" ignores every kind of basic elements of good movie: well-written plot, interesting characters and most of all a dynamic action. It\\'s one of the worst kind of productions, wchich creators hopped that, a few good action scenes would build up the whole film. Unfortunately, they were mistaken. It doesn\\'t work like this.',\n",
       "  'I watched this movie as an inmate at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. I am in love with this movie. A lot of people don\\'t appreciate it, but it is one of the few movies in the world that tries to capture the feeling of being fearless. It succeeds on multiple fronts for me, and the cinematography and timing is superb. You get to go places that you probably will never go in your life time. I think people who are used to sitting on their couches and critiquing movies are making the reviews. You should not listen to them. This movie is a must-see, an experience of things few people will ever do in their lifetime, and yet... there are people doing them.What does it feel like to be truly free? It requires not only the external circumstance of being able to do \"what you want\" to do. It requires physical fitness, stamina, and your own inner choice to be free, regardless of the constraints of society. Doing what you believe and choose against all odds, taking the consequences for your actions, and then to know what it is to live without fear. FEARLESS.How many fearless people are reviewing this movie? There are few in the world, my friend, and I am one of them. This movie resonates with me for that reason.',\n",
       "  'Point Break was rebooted in 2001, it was called The Fast and the Furious where the surfing was replaced by street car racing.This remake sees extreme sports athlete Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) who after losing a friend when a motocross stunt goes wrong goes on to become a FBI agent some years later. His boss Hall (Delroy Lindo) sends him to investigate a series of elaborate heists from a gang who behave like Robin Hood robbers.Utah believes that the group are taking part in the Ozaki 8, eight spiritually extreme sport challenges that coincide with the daring robberies. Utah infiltrates the gang which is led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez.)In its own right the film starts brightly enough with plenty of CGI enhanced action but later on the film actually comes to a stop in the non action sequences when the characters just talk. The film then becomes boring and after a while even the action scenes just get duller. The colour grading is awful making the film look cheap despite the international locations.The original Point Break directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who would go on to become the first female Oscar winning director found a zeitgeist of Generation X sports action thriller with well staged action sequences. Although not the greatest actors around, Bigelow got charismatic turns from Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze and sturdy support from Gary Busey as Reeves FBI boss.The remake lacks all of this even though it tried to go on a new direction. I tried to give it a break and approached it with an open mind but alas it is a poor film.',\n",
       "  'The actors and director of this re-make of a classic action film must have gone home after making it singing Dierks Bentley\\'s song \"What Was I Thinking?\" ...It is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT to anyone who is a fan of the original.But like most classic movie re-makes, the entire team hired to make this flick completely screwed it up. Too much to complain about, and I am usually very forgiving., but this movie just plain sucked. I\\'m glad Patrick Swayze wasn\\'t alive to see this pos re-make.For one, the plot doesn\\'t even come close to the original - just a few sad, lame-ass attempts to link it to the original classic 1991 film in order to call the movie by the same name, such as stealing and inserting scenes like: - re-using all the main character\\'s names - Johnny shooting into the sky when he fails to kill Bodhi - Bodhi escaping and having to die by a monster-wave at the end.Ray Winstone\\'s talent is completely wasted playing Pappas, and is probably embarrassed his name is now associated with this mess.... there is so many more example of this it is ridiculous.So other than calling this flick by the same name of the original classic, and inserting these stolen scenes and names from the original, the movie is something, but it isn\\'t POINT BREAK.In the end, it\\'s just an excuse for some self-serving, over-rated, uber-tattooed actors to get a woody playing extreme-sport idiots, and some adrenaline-junky film makers to get their rocks off filming stupid stunts in exotic locations.If your an extreme sports fanatic and don\\'t give a crap about plots, themes, or just a decent action flick, then grab your favorite power-bar and energy-drink and watch it while downing your steroids.But is you are a true fan of the original Swayze-Reeves 1991 classic POINT BREAK, and were hoping this might be even half the movie the original, you will very, very disappointed.The studio execs should have just called this mess NO POINT or GIVE ME A BREAK, because there is absolutely no point in watching this piece of crap excuse for a film.',\n",
       "  \"This movie is not boring at all and it's full of well done action sequences and it's absolutely worth watching Fortunately, I'm an extreme sports enthusiast n i love rock climbing n mountain biking. It has the most spectacular visuals of surfing, snowboarding, rock climbing, wing-suiting, bike stunts, etc. The director Erickson Core himself did the cinematography. Hes an amateur director but veteran cinematographer. No wonder the film has exceptional cinematography with setting like surfing in the middle of the ocean, Angel falls and the Alps. The movie has remarkable camera work, the film was able to capture every crucial move with acute depth. I was not expecting Oscar worthy performances. Edgar Ramírez got a strong screen presence n he did a good job. It delivered what I expected. Its my kinda action flick. I hate those super hero films, except Nolan's Batman trilogy. Well story-wise this is just a mediocre movie, but the stunts and scenery make the 1 hour and 45 minutes worth the watch for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing. I know and understand what goes through the minds of extreme sports enthusiasts and why they do it. U cannot call it a remake of the original classic. It's jus inspired by the original.\",\n",
       "  \"obviously this heap of garbage of a movie was an attempt at a money grab on the name of a mildly successful well known Point Break movie. 1st off, like the original the acting was pretty horrible. 2nd, unlike the original the screen play was awful. Things are just pieced together, no real story line of any realistic or logical conclusions. They really tried way to hard in this movie and it flopped. You need more than some extreme sport scenes to make a movie cool. This movie lacked any sort of real character development, any interest to pull the viewer in other than some nicely shot scenes. It's mostly Hollywood drivel. It's a shame they wasted such a huge budget on this movie, although I'm sure the extreme athletes who performed the stunts appreciated the pay check from it. I would skip this movie. Go watch the original it's better written, better acted (that's saying a lot) and a more interesting movie.\",\n",
       "  'So many terrible reviews! Why such negativity? I\\'ve seen this film 9 times and counting. It\\'s so beautiful. It\\'s cinematic poetry! Point Break is a cautionary tale because the eco-warriors rebellion only leads to destruction of others and self. It\\'s the paradox of humankind - good and wicked all in one. Please watch with an open mind! Also, I find the extreme-sports-nature sequences breathtaking and beautiful and full of high energy action. There are also some inspiring ideals along the way: \"the break point, the point where fear becomes master and you the slave...\" I understand Core\\'s approach and Kurt Wimmer\\'s screen-writing logic: a story of friendship with a crazy philosophical twist and rebellion turned into criminal. The natural wonders are fantastic! Huge surf waves, Alps, and Angel Falls. Yes I\\'m biased... I\\'m from Venezuela, and I think Edgard Ramirez did a spectacular job with his character and Angel Falls are magnificent! Luke Bracey as Johnny Utah is heartfelt and charismatic. Roach, Chowder, Grommet, Pappas, and Samsara were great too. All straightforward and minimal dialogue. Did you know that the climbing of Auyantepui was real? The line and bolts were digitized out, but it was and experience of a lifetime for these climbers. Chris Sharma, Peter Croft, and Dany Andrada were the stunt doubles. The behind-the-scenes video is astounding! One big mistake? To have marketed this movie as a remake of Point Break 1991: it\\'s inspired by it but another story. And yes, there are problems with the plot and character development, but that\\'s because the focus is on the visual story more than dialogue. Another major problem is that the writing and the dialogue lines are too abstract and metaphoric and ambiguous. It\\'s not clear at times what Bodhi means or what Johnny Utah wants. I think I got it and I enjoyed the film, but I can see how it can be confusing to audiences. Teresa Palmer\\'s lines too are full of philosophical ideas that sound abstract as well. In this version, Bodhi is a protégé of Osaki, a fictionalized eco-warrior with the idea of saving Earth by performing 8 ordeals (this is the fiction). But Osaki was killed by a whaling ship when he was \"giving back\"... Later, Bodhi follows Osaki\\'s steps, but he has taken the wrong path. Bohdi wants to accomplish his 8-ordeals to become one with the Earth and give back through criminal/sabotage acts. However, there\\'s good in Bodhi, for he saves Utah\\'s life for some unknown compassionate reason(??). Perhaps Osaki saved Bodhi\\'s life once just like in Utah\\'s situation? It would\\'ve been great to see the setup story for Bodhi as well. Yet, Bodhi is determined and he doesn\\'t care he is killing people and destroying assets when he \"gives back to Earth.\"Without the crime, these guys would be extreme-sports crusaders for mother Earth\\'s wonders: which would be a whole different story - perhaps I\\'ll write a new Point Break screenplay inspired by this version of Point Break (I\\'m a screen writing student). Then we have Johnny Utah, a former extreme-sports turned FBI agent, but we don\\'t learn why he specifically joins the FBI. The film would have benefited from additional minutes to set up the characters better and explore their deeper emotional motives. That\\'s what\\'s lacking. Utah goes undercover to find out why these extreme-athletes are committing crimes, only to get too involved to be able to stop them: part of Utah relishes in the chaos and he enters into a conflict with himself. Utah however, is the perfect agent to pursue the extreme-sports criminals. But his longing for the sport and his gratitude to Bodhi are stronger than his FBI mission. And worse yet for the mission: Utah has a soft-heart and Bodhi knows that. Utah owes him his life. Utah is in a great dilemma - apprehend and kill the very person that saved his life?In the end, the power of gratitude and kindness prevails in Utah. And he gets back his passion for life. And the bad guys find their fate...Enjoy. Best wishes.',\n",
       "  'Based on the motion Picture Point Break (1991)? Well yeah, by name and character-names. Every time I heard names like Bodhi on Utah I wanted to hurl. Why was this movie made? It\\'s got a lot of action, but everyone who has seen original Point Break is disgusted by this movie. The group who was robbing banks in the original, \"the dead presidents\" are Eco warriors in the new movie \"freeing\" money instead of robbing it. Characters Utah and Bodhi never bond like in the original movie and it makes the whole experience shallow and meaningless. The girl Utah falls in the original, is an mentor and a teacher to Utah, and in the new movie she is just a junkie. Point Break 2015 should\\'ve been a movie called Adrenaline Rush with different character-names. It would have been better picture with names like Jim and Bob than Bodhi and Utah.Do not make remakes that make no sense please?']]"

Genie Francis and Tony Geary who have become the phenomenal Luke and Laura.  Luke and Laura made General Hospital the unforgettable soap opera it is, and still today, Luke and Laura's though painful relationship, keeps viewers going through their fascinating characterization and never ending passion between them.Alan and Monica, played by Leslie Charleson and Stuart Damon, Frisco and Felicia, played by Jack and Kristina Wagner, Robert and Holly, played by Tristan Rogers and Emma Samms, Sonny and Brenda, played by Maurice Bernard and Vanessa Marcil, and Luke and Laura have showed every other soap opera the definition of a \"love story\".  Though never simple, always intense, always unforgettable.General Hospital has also shown amazing technique in storylines that are not love stories.  Such as Monica Quartermaine's heartwrenching breast cancer storyline in 1994, or the amazing storyline of two little girls dying, yet only one miracle came out of it.  I could only be talking about Bobbie Spencer's and Tony Jones's daughter BJ giving her heart to Frisco and Felicia's daughter Maxie, in the last moments to save her life.  These stories touched many viewers and there are so many more.Some of the most precious moments on daytime television have occurred on General Hospital, and the highest rated moment on daytime television was Luke and Laura's wedding in 1981.  It was said to be the only wedding ever to rival Princess Diana's.  General Hospital has created feelings, storylines, and characters that go beyond words.  I thank Genie and Tony who play Luke and Laura for bringing out the fantasy we all have about how love should be.  Though they are General Hospital's greatest achievement, I don't think General Hospital's done with them yet!  And we know that Luke and Laura are not the only life changing storyline they've come up with!  Thank you General Hospital!\n"

Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time! Nothing was typical about this. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow, the scenario, everything.\\nI highly recommend it for mystery lovers, for anyone who wants to watch a good movie! This is a movie one would not regret spending money on. After a long time I am rating a movie perfect 10 and this movie totally deserves it. I really like the subtle comedy sprinkled in the movie. It easies out the tense atmosphere. In a good detective movie, you expect to be taken aback on how things unfold at the end and this is what happens in this movie. There is never an instant when you would get distracted or bored. I had a good time watching this movie and you would surely have it too. With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with \"Knives Out\", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It\\'s abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie\\'s typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of \"Knives Out\" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan\\'s bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. \"Knives Out\" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn\\'t deserve all this hatred from disappointed \"Star Wars\" geeks) As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can\\'t go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre. Best movie of the year, love everything about it, what I\\'m seeing is that some trolls that still can\\'t get over TLJ, now for those that have and give it a 1 well that\\'s fair but have some reasons why, not just bc it\\'s Rian Johnson, like stop it\\'s childish I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn\\'t live up to it for me. But I thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I\\'m not sorry I spent some money on this one. Let me start by saying that the film is good. It\\'s a solid murder mystery and I\\'ll make sure I watch Knives Out 2 when it comes out. All I kept hearing about this film was that it was hilarious and brilliant and \\'so damn good\\' etc etc etc. I usually take these sorts of reactions with a grain of salt but, having seen the trailer and seeing how great the cast was, I bought into the hype. It looked so stylish, so compelling.\\nI really got my hopes up, and I can\\'t help thinking I would have enjoyed the film far more if I hadn\\'t been inundated with so many reviews heralding it as some brilliant masterpiece.\\nI was expecting a lot of laughs and whilst I did laugh on occasion, I didn\\'t laugh nearly as much as I was hoping I would. A film like this would have benefited from some black humor (maybe Rian could have co-written the film wish a British comedy writer for some more quality laughs... Phoebe Waller Bridge, perhaps?)\\nI enjoyed the scenes when the whole family was together and interacting with each other and I wish the film spent more time on them instead of opting for that ridiculous car chase and several other scenes that took me out of the whodunnit atmosphere.\\nOverall, this film is a solid good time, entertaining, clever and well acted and written but, in my opinion, definitely doesn\\'t live up to the hype. I have read the many glowing reviews for this film and I honestly don\\'t get it. Yes, there were some very funny and entertaining parts. It was a very good ensemble cast. Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the \"murder\" was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying \"Random, you\\'re back AGAIN\" or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the \"slayer\" law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn\\'t there be at least some surprises?Nor do I believe this is a \"commentary\" on our situation today. Yes, there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.That is not to say it is a bad film. Daniel Craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball. Lots of kooky things happened. But I think this is better for a late-nite Netflix watch.I certainly don\\'t see it as being \"best of the year.\" I went into this film with high expectations to say the least. I had heard so many good things about it, so it was built up in my mind as this phenomenal murder mystery movie, but it fell short. Where do I begin? Daniel Craig has this southern accent that just does not come across as convincing, not annoying, but not convincing. The main character of the film, Marta, potrayed by Ana de Armas, has this very unbelievable physiological condition in which she vomits every time that she tells a lie. I mean, come on people. This vomiting \\'tool\\' is used multiple times throughout the film to figure out the truth about some of the other characters in the story. Let\\'s just say that she vomits excessively until the credits start to roll.Now, the part of this film that really upset me was the \\'big reveal\\' at the end. It is revealed at the end that detective Benoit Blanc knew about the blood stain on Marta\\'s shoe the whole time. The biggest issue with this reveal is why he didn\\'t ask her about it. He would have known her involvment in the murder the whole time. Why didn\\'t he get the blood spot on her shoe tested? That would have easily put her in the room with Harlan when he died.Overall, the movie was entertaining up until we are revealed what happened between Marta and Harlan. Once I found out how Harlan died, I started to lose interest. It basically lost the \\'mystery\\' quality once that happened. The story went flat after that but then took off when new developments started to happen. The reason I give this movie a 6/10 is because I was able to figure out things about the story right away, which left me disappointed, and the blood spot made me question a majority of the movie. It wasn\\'t a bad watch, but I don\\'t think I will be watching it again. Being a middle aged Englishman I\\'ve been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I\\'ve been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of \\'Knives Out\\' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it\\'s cleverer than it is. It\\'s simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming \\'I am woke\\' at the top of his lungs at anybody who\\'ll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you\\'d not be any less aware of what\\'s happening. A bit of a shame really. I\\'m a mystery lover and have seen and read every Agatha Christie tale. I found this movie very slow for the first half. Second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit, nor the charm and period atmosphere of a Poirot episode (which I can watch over and over - thank you David Suchet and the other main actors). The lead actress was very attractive, but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch, as well as ridiculously unbelievable (I guess that was the funny part?). Some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather-beaten. Did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. The last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid-fire conclusion thank the Lord. Agree that Daniel Craig with that southern accent was just super annoying. Great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat. Over and over. It moved pretty slowly for me at times. I guess I\\'m in a minority on this one. I\\'m not saying it was terrible but it was not a great movie for me. Mildly entertaining with a great cast and high production value. The story is soft but not awful. I can\\'t imagine saying this film deserves more than a 6. Knives out uses a really old idea, the \"whodunit\". Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don\\'t really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig\\'s amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don\\'t know much about Star Wars as I don\\'t really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don\\'t know what\\'s going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its\\' director. Looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious Oscar contender for multiple awards, while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls (?) etc. I\\'m confused. I say it\\'s nothing special and I\\'m not a Star Wars fanatic. I\\'ve never even seen the film people are so angry about, so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film, Knives Out.I definitely expected more. If it\\'s meant to be amusing, it pretty much failed on that score. This film would be better suited as a TV movie, if they even make them anymore, or something to pop up on Netflix. I didn\\'t pay to see it and I\\'d feel I\\'d wasted my money if I had.Visually it was enjoyable-I mean the location, the house, the production values. the family members were an unattractive bunch, so nothing to look at there. Daniel Craig\\'s \"southern\" accent became grating after awhile, and I was squirming a bit with boredom, waiting for it to be over. And, when it was, my reaction was \"So what? Who cares?\" I can hardly remember any of it and I just watched it in the last couple of hours.Convoluted, unrealistic and tedious, like a lot of Agatha Christie stories. How this has ended up on some people\\'s Best Films of 2019 lists is beyond me. It was okay; nothing special. Knives Out (2019)\\n8/10🗡🚪💉💸\"Rian Johnson successfully revives the \"whodunnit\" mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time, even if it doesn\\'t bring anything groundbreaking to the table.\"Knives Out is the kind of \"whodunnit\" film that will never fail to entertain. As a progressive mystery, Knives Out is a very fashionable movie with it\\'s grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. With some very snarky and slick writing, these characters are albeit memorable, most notably Daniel Craig\\'s Detective Blanc and Chris Evan\\'s Ransome, however, the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson\\'s strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it\\'s footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.Verdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways. GENERAL REVIEW\\nGoing in, I was expecting an energetic Edgar Wright feel, and complex Sherlock Holmes mystery in which the audience tries to solve it at the same time. What I got was a cookie cutter \\'mystery\\' that was different from others in its genre only in its use of bright colours, rather than any sort of trope and convention subversion or parody.SPOILER TIMEIn regards to acting, Christopher Plummer, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans gave great performances. 0 complaints for the main 3, I thoroughly enjoyed Harlan and Marta\\'s scenes. There are more than 3 members of the cast, of which I have complaints; Jamie Lee Curtis and Micheal Shannon among others gave performances that seemed to change personalities every few lines, probably due to Rian Johnson\\'s directing. Don Johnson was good, LaKeith Stanfield was not, others were mediocre or just less.\\nSpecial Daniel Craig section. Daniel Daniel Daniel. What was that. The screenplay reads \"Blanc ... speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have ever heard in your life.\" That is not what I was forced to listen to. The accent was very distracting and I could only hope for a case of Stockholm syndrome that never came. His character was meant to act as an absurdist archetype satire of the noir detective, but instead he came across as an annoying detective who did not diverge from the archetypal role. If that didn\\'t bother you then it would have been a good performanceAs mentioned I was expecting more Edgar Wright-esque editing and cinematography that the trailer promised me.Overall, the writing is very basic, being a typical murder mystery. I am unsure if you can even call it a murder mystery when you find out the truth a quarter through. Throughout the story, there were many setups with minimal or no payoff, e.g. shoe blood, where is Marta from (Harlan should have commented to Ransom during their fight where she is from). There were also too many inconsistencies, like how the stairs did not actually make a noise every time, some people went up with a noise and down without because Rian Johnson forgot.\\nFor the final reveal; Marta must be especially talented to feel \"tincture and viscosity\" of vials, a quality you might be able to feel when you are drawing a syringe, but she had made the choice already which solution to use, maybe density or weight would be acceptable but the given explanation of her being such a good person that her vail choice was correct is pretty dumb. Also, the shots for Fran\\'s last words were different, where she said \"you did this\" in the scene and first flashback, but \"Hugh did this\" in the last. These 2 issues detract from the fun of watching murder mysteries, in which an audience should be able to find the killer if they have been paying attention, instead the script pretended like you should have known these facts.\\nThe suspect game instead was played by cast knowledge. By looking at the cast you can see it\\'s either Jamie Lee Curtis, Micheal Shannon or Chris Evans, personally I guessed Micheal Shannon due to his typecasting, but when I realised that all 3 of Harlan\\'s children where the same character, with different jobs, it was then obviously the built up character named Ransom. Ransom. His name is Ransom.This leads me to one of my main critiques: Unnecessary characters. Despite all 3 of Harlan\\'s children being the same, the \"nazi kid\" served 1 purpose that could have easily been delivered by another character, the granddaughter, Katherine Langford served a whopping 2 purposes that all together could have been dropped and exchanged. There were 2 cops and Blanc for some reason, of which the comedic policeman was not funny.Lastly, too many convenient devices like the stairs that made a noise \\'every time\\', Marta vomiting when she lies, the dogs choosing to like and dislike people, or the various murder mystery cliches that excuse themselves through being self aware (secret doors and prop knives) I actually wish  would do away with the star-rating portion of their website because it doesn\\'t give an accurate rating for films and this film is a perfect example. Everyone knows that there are many bitter Star Wars fanboys rating this film low because they are still so bitter over Rian Johnson\\'s The Last Jedi and as a result, they are going to try to ruin any of Rian\\'s future films. They really need to just get over it and get a life, already. DON\\'T believe the Star-Rating of This Film Because It\\'s Mostly from Bitter Star Wars Fanboys Rating the Film LOW ON PURPOSE!, obviously. Anyone who has actually seen this film would be brain-dead to rate it low or to not give it a good review because this film is so freaking entertaining! I could see it again and again. It\\'s so different than the crap that has been in the theaters lately. It\\'s fun, it\\'s thrilling, it\\'s wacky, it has so many twists and turns that it always keeps you guessing. And for the cast, what a freaking cast! I couldn\\'t even tell you who the MVP of the cast was. They were all fantastic. We need more films like this and less big explosions, stupid plot films. I for one, will give this the true star-rating it deserves! 10/10!!!!! Bitter Star Wars fanboys, you can keep being immature and rating it low, but it isn\\'t going to change the fact that the film is great and I\\'m going to encourage every single person to go out and see it pronto when it hits theaters! Generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery TV shows than movies, this is partially since it\\'s hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time.\\nThis movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects. It has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details mid-movie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute.\\nThe acting was brilliant and I didn\\'t feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage. Have to say I was a little disappointed by this, not because it isn\\'t good. Arguably it is, but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good, which it isn\\'t. So as with so many films your experience & enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.Overall I think nearly everyone will enjoy this, particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated CGI. Having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of Hollywood. One of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath, but not always beneath, the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it\\'s difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie, which without giving too much away it ultimately does.What is genuinely enjoyable is Daniel Craig\\'s slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match. The rest of the cast features some big names, but unfortunately as others have pointed out they don\\'t always have that much to do. Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is Don Johnson.The Plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all, and while it\\'s quite good, it isn\\'t that good or that original. The key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable (for the record I didn\\'t work out who did it, but did work out the mechanism involved). If one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement Knives Out falls somewhat short. A part of the problem is that for much of the film it isn\\'t clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place. In the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister.Perhaps the best aspect of the film, aside of Daniel Craig, was the fact that the Johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy & the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller. I\\'ll probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I\\'d have to say I probably enjoyed Adam Sandler & Jennifer Aniston\\'s Murder Mystery more than this, including with regard to the solution. Knives Out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it - or anyone else I\\'d venture - thinks it is. Still enjoyable though Really boring for the most time. Lots of wasted potential. I don\\'t understand the nomination and positve reviews. It\\'s just an OK movie. A missed opportunity to do something better. The movie plays like the worst episode of COLUMBO you have ever seen, only this time it features Daniel Craig attempting to imitate Foghorn Leghorn. Learn from my mistake and avoid this turkey. Others have mentioned the old house might have held some secrets (it didn\\'t). Or that it might present a more structured \"Whodunit\" that leaves you guessing (it didn\\'t). Or that the main character might offer a bit of verve, cleverness or pizazz, that might have livened up the whole affair (she doesn\\'t, at all).I also take some issue with the director\\'s choices in scene framing, especially in the beginning. There should have been more close-ups, and better initial intros for each character\\'s little idiosyncrasies so we would could warm up to them. I simply don\\'t care for how it was shot; it\\'s terribly pedestrian. The fast, quick edits of the trailer are totally absent! There\\'s something missing here. Todd Solondz, Tim Burton or the Cohen Brothers really could have drawn these characters out more and given the actors something real to work with.I thought it would sparkle with a bit more witty, dark humor. It wasn\\'t quite as funny or snappy as I was expecting it to be. Instead, it settles on delivering more of a \"message\" about this girl, who does good, while the others do bad.There\\'s also no need for Daniel Craig\\'s poor Southern accent. He should have just done a British accent, it would have been fine and enjoyable, maybe given the film a bit more weight it seems it was shooting for, in the end, with its messaging.Additional viewings might reveal there\\'s more to it, but I suspect such might reveal there\\'s less. A Stella cast carrying a whodunit will depend entirely on the story... Sadly, instead of \"the plot thickens\", it thins out unbearably...Overall the movie was entertaining enough to watch... But the plot was stretched a little thin and the ending was disappointing...A whodunit works by bringing the audience along to try to figure out the crime and be pleasantly surprised at the big reveal... This movie decided at the half way point that it no longer wants to be a whodunit and we no longer should follow along as it does its own thing... Sigh...I wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone who truly enjoy the genre..Spoiler Alert...Let\\'s tackle the minor annoyances first...1) The beginning sets everyone out as having a motive to murder... Standard for the genre but here, it stops there...No building up of everyone/anyone who also had the opportunity to commit the murder... Motive without opportunity doesn\\'t add up to murder...This means... Before the middle of the story, we have already eliminated almost everyone as the suspect... Which kinda defeats the whodunit plotline...2) Having a girl who is a witness who vomits if she lies is extremely convenient for a murder detective... And... Surely any investigator will target her for as much information as possible...Here however, to preserve the big reveal later I guess, they let her off without ever really questioning her...(even Ransom got more information than the investigators did...)In fact, the detectives were more interested in talking to Benoit and kept telling her to go away after finding out this rather beneficial condition...This leaves a feeling of a weak plot that cannot exclude her from some crucial events...She didn\\'t have to witness the suicide... Which in itself didn\\'t add anything to the story... And with that, she could spill the beans on what she did and we can all still believe there was further foul play involved...3) Marta and Benoit find the hidden tox report after spending hours to chase it down... Yet they can sit down to have a chat after finding it but neither even opened it to take a look?This gives us the scene where she was about to confess in front of the whole family but was stopped in mid sentence... Drama!!!!That\\'s ridiculous and again feels forced/false...4) Walt confronts Marta at her home... He evades the horde of reporters and came in via the back way...Firstly, a rich guy like him would likely never have to use the back way and wouldn\\'t be able to find one...Secondly, Walt is the \\'boss\\' of a printing empire and it\\'s unreasonable that nobody in the media recognises him...Thirdly, he walks/limps with a cane...Is he really the best person to go seek Marta out under the circumstance?\\nWouldn\\'t Meg, Donna or Jacob be better suited for the stealth-required mission?5) Captain frigging America... Emm, I mean Ransom... When he left and came back, wouldn\\'t that be recorded in the early part of the surveillance video? He stopped exactly where she stopped...Ok, this one, maybe I can accept the reason is he knows the area well and was able to evade detection... Still unsatisfying though...6) Fran wants to confront Ransom believing he killed Harlan...a woman, confronting a man/killer even if he\\'s not Captain America, surely wouldn\\'t choose an abandoned/creepy location to meet..What does she think will happen? This is not a slasher flick where dumb teenagers go into the room despite multiple warnings not to...7) Harlan was in a terrible rush to kill himself...Marta explained that he will die in\\n10 minutes... And at around the 5 minutes mark, he will sweat profusely and have some other symptoms...Wouldn\\'t a normal person wait until the symptoms start to show before reaching for the knife?\\nMany more minor niggles like Benoit not needing to introduce himself before sitting inside the house witnessing all the \\'interrogations\\'... -There seem to be no other maids or servants in such a huge, well maintained house, that needed to be questioned... -Marta just happens to have a large magnet in her pocket for erasing a video tape... -Nobody who wasn\\'t around needs to have an alibi for their whereabouts...-none of the other detectives see the blood stain on Marta\\'s shoe...Too many roll eyes moments for a whodunit plot...Now...Let\\'s get to the parts that killed the movie/story...1) Benoit doing his best Poirot... And gave too much details without any evidence...Examples...-He could simply say Ransom switched the medication.. But instead, he goes into details of how he sucked out medication from one bottle and then from the other bottle... How would he know that?-How did he deduce that it was Ransom who sent him the cash?-How can he be so sure that a person with dementia simply didn\\'t mix up \\'back\\' and \\'back again\\'... Very thin even if we can accept the inference...If he\\'s wrong at any point, Ransom could stop him and the story telling ends...These plus some other details he brought up without any evidence shows that he is just showboating and not very professional... He should be more mindful of his reputation... And this goes against his persona of being careful with what he says as shown in the beginning...2) the claim is that Ransom torched the examiners\\' office the night before... And yet in the morning light (actually around 9am already...) and the fire on that not-large building seem to just get going... In real life, it should be ashes before daylight... Unless it was touched an hour or two before 9am...Since Ransom was with Marta in the morning, he couldn\\'t have done it...3) we were told that overdose of morphine means dying in 10 minutes...When Marta found Fran, Ransom was in police custody and there was nobody else around... She should be the prime suspect...And obviously, Ransom couldn\\'t have done that too...4) in the scene where she makes her escape after the will reading...the family couldn\\'t stop her if she wanted to drive away... Richard said something like, what do you want me to do, bite the bumper?(to stop her leaving...)... But when she came out of the car, push through the crowd to get into Ransom\\'s car, not a single person stopped her getting in...This is of course essential for her to spend quality time with Ransom... Totally unrealistic...In conclusion...As said... Not bad entertainment (6-7) but a terrible whodunit (2-3)... So around 4.5 overall... This movie has an identity crisis; it can\\'t decide if it\\'s a thriller, mystery, drama, comedy or romance! As a result, it\\'s somewhat of a mess and difficult to sit through. It\\'s a shame because the acting is really good; the script just can\\'t keep up. Both the male and female leads were superb. Very talented actors who have huge careers ahead of them. The film was okay. His character was interesting. But the way he filmed guests was a little unbelievable and didn\\'t make sense. But I could ride with that. The story was a gentle run but with nothing of note to remember. I probably wouldn\\'t watch it again but I will be keen to see both the actors in something new. I recommend this film for a relaxed afternoon. Oh, and I think Helen Hunt is in it. Or someone who looks a bit like her. It\\'s rare you i find a movie i watch all through, let alone recommend to anyone, with that in mind, if you want to see a movie that is well acted, has a story that keeps your interest, is not predictable and has twists in the tale, you will find this worth a watch as a minimum. This one is a head scratcher....and by head scratcher i mean after the film is over you will scratch your head wondering why anyone would sign onto this movie. To say that the story was poorly conceived would be a an understatement. The movie goes absolutely no where and ultimately you\\'re left with a feeling of regret for how you chose to spend the last hour and a half of your lifeThe Good : Tye Sheridan\\'s performance as a high functioning man with Asperger\\'s , seeing John Leguizamo in something since John Wick Chapter 2 and a briefly topless Ana de ArmasThe Bad : Everything elseTLDR: Skip this one for sure See past the crime movie, see past the thiller, see past the hollywood. This movie was great with 2 incredible actors. If people don\\'t understand deeper meanings and symbolism. Don\\'t watch it. The problem with \\'The Night Clerk\\', and I\\'ve seen many films fall into this trap, is that it gives itself a really annoying lead character for the audience to have to follow and side with. Now there are two sides to that coin. One is that the character is unique and interesting to watch from a medical point of view, and that\\'s why the movie puts him there. But the other side of that coin is that it becomes really frustrating and hard to watch very quickly. It gives the film a point of difference, but a point of difference for the sake of it isn\\'t always enough.Tye Sheridan does a fantastic job playing the lead role. He nails Aspergers syndrome. Before it was ever mentioned in the film I was 100% certain that was what I was looking at. He keeps it up for the entire movie and never drops a scene either. The other cast member who really impressed me was Ana de Armas. I came to learn of her acting talents in \\'Knives Out\\' and she has impressed me again here. She didn\\'t have anything overly special to do in the film, but you could still tell she was a class above the rest.The film itself is a little obvious in what it is trying to set up and surprise the audience with. There\\'s one scene in particular that they thought they were being subtle with, but in reality it put all the cards on the table and gave the game away. Also there is a mystery element of sorts to the film that, had it been handled differently, could have been really interesting. Instead it was just clunky and petered out to dust by the end. I think the thing to watch this film for is Sheridan\\'s performance and as a character study of an Aspergers syndrome. Otherwise there isn\\'t a whole lot going for it. Before watching any movie, i\\'d always set lower expectation for the movie and it usually pays off. This movie is like that. You have to know what you\\'re getting into and you must know what your expectation.If you expect full blown mystery thriller like Primal Fear, prepare to be disappointed. But if you expect something to pass your free time with a short linear mystery thriller, this is the movie for you.The plot is quite monotonous with the only twist was at the end but it is what i\\'m expecting by reading the synopsis. It\\'s about an MC who have an asperger syndrom accused of murder. The focus is not whether he did it or not because i think it is pretty self explanatory during the scene. If you as many people expect this as the main focus of this movie, again, prepare to be disappointed. It is about how the MC want to prove that he\\'s innocent without the help of police, how he trapped all who\\'s involved or related to the murder that want to set him up but actually he know\\'s all along and how he set them up again.All in all, it\\'s not really that bad. I truly could not wait for this crap to end. First off, you got a hotel employee with Asperger with hidden cameras in the rooms watching guest? And it just so happens he witnesses a domestic violence incident? This was just so wrong on so many levels I don\\'t even know where to start. The minute the screen on my TV faded to black, I came here to warn you all, that this was utterly time wasted. I so don\\'t recommend it. The night clerk is socially awkward yet not very convincing as a person with Asperger\\'s syndrome. The story is dull, predictable and plods along at a snail\\'s pace. The poor acting of the lead, the silliness of the script and bad editing all combines to make this film difficult to watch through to the end. Very amateurish. No idea why they made this movie. It was slow, boring and predictable which is a kinder way of saying stupid. Its a film about autism spectrum disorder, a young man with high but ever so locked up mental capasity, who has vast compications connecting to other åeople. working as the night clerk at a hotel, he feels that he can control and surveil the environment, and as part of his self therapy, uses hidden cameras in the hotel rooms, just to practice how to interact with people, especially the female part of the guests. but as a crime occurs on his night watch, things become very dire for him.its a strange study into the head of a complicated person. its kinda rainman feeling rendering you while watching, at the same time its not. there are some confussionin the plot, the characters are pretty undeveloped, and its hard to say what reaaly happened in the end..seems to me they were in a hurry to get an end to the story,it could have been much better....the grumpy old man gives a 6 for the main cast, its a small recommend, and a joyridee if youre in the trade of working peoples heads.. Predictable or not, I found the acting great, and the story, a bittersweet reminder of how naive we used to be as well, or perhaps, still are sometimes. After reading the other users reviews I was kinda of demotivated to watch this movie. Fortunately I did watch it and it was a GOOD Movie(with a capital M). It wasn\\'t hard to watch at all and it kept my attention throughout.\\nI highly recommended it. This movie wasn\\'t bad, slow but interesting. But the end??? So rushed. It spoiled the whole movie, what happened? How? Why? Tye Sheridan really impressed me with his portrayal of a man with Asperger\\'s. He is very convincing, from the lack of eye contact to his mannerisms. The story itself is a little slow, and lacks an emotional climax. I have no idea why I watched this till the end when it was annoying me within 5 minutes. Tye Sheridan plays a night clerk with Aspergers in a motel. I don\\'t know anyone with this affliction, but I do know his character was driving me nuts and his acting came across as forced and phony. The story is preposterous, I thought this was suppose to be a thriller, but it\\'s just an extremely boring and drawn out drama about him trying to cope and in a back story there is a murder. It\\'s just nonsense, with uninspired performances and dialogue, scenes that go on so long you\\'ll be nodding off and towards the end what was boring became confusing and ridiculous, in fact I had no idea what was going on. Ana De Armas is very beautiful but she needs to avoid Cr*p like this if she wants a long term career. This is complete Hollywood made for television garbage using a real mental condition to wring some sympathy from a bad script with a ludicrous plot. What were any of these people thinking? How did anyone show up on the second day of filming? I loved every minute of this movie.. The acting were superb especially Tye Sheridan\\'s.. the brief romance between Ana De Armas\\'s and Tye at the swimming pool was really heartwarming. and lastly I didnt see the ending coming. It fooled me alright. Artsy was defeated by Slow & Dismal! The Actors did their part but the writers and editors failed tremendously. Slow movie but the acting was alright. The two lead actors were average but did well for a movie with a dull script Love this movie. Great acring, great place. Worth a watch. I really tried to like it but the more time passed in the movie the worst it got. The only quality of the movie was the acting of the male lead. The female lead was actually a pretty bad in my opinion. Her acting was not believable and came off a bit annoying. The script was simply terrible and all over the place. And the worst part was that almost everything about this movie was predictable. A boring and badly written movie. I only commend Tye Sheridan and John Leguzamo(detective) in all of this. Yes, that statement made you think more and had more twists and turns than this whole movie. At least you have a 50/50 chance of having some fun when you see a balloon knot as compared to the 100% crap you get with this thing. Only this slower than this movie a one legged giraffe on a skateboard. Tye Sheridan\\'s acting was exceptionally excellent \"EE\"!! Brilliant mate. Top work, I understand Tye most likely studied his art in depth and it shows here. Plus John Leguizamo! Wow you owned the role and so lovely that you were a good rough cop. Who also respected the disorders or? Orders of autism:-)\\nThank you guys for making this great acting with great writing and directing!\\nA must watch Good cast and nice narrative buildup, slowly brewing. Works fine. Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982\\'s Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today\\'s audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.\\nThe Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph. Wow this was terrible and cliched.Really, if you have no ideas, reason or script just.skip.it.I woke up long enough to feel sorry for a suffering dog, but that is about it. Where is the action? Where is the crescendo? Where is the meaning??? What? Replicants can now give birth? So they are not replicants anymore and can be considered bona fide humans so what is the morale of all of this?? Pros: Beautiful to look at Beautiful women Cool technology Cons: SlowNothing is resolved Boring script, dialogue and lines Typical sequel (a shadow of its prequel) They really should become more judicious in picking which movies need a sequel and if they do that 90% of sequels will never come to be and the focus will shift towards developing new ideas. For film fanatics like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is a great film for people to see, regardless if they\\'ve witnessed the original or not. On the other hand, if you\\'ve never seen the original Blade Runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I\\'d have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. It\\'s very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that\\'s exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why Blade Runner 2049 is a must see as soon as possible. Before dropping you into this world with Ryan Gosling\\'s character, there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past, but even though that information is given to you, your experience just won\\'t be the same without having viewed the first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it. Set out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story, Ryan Gosling\\'s character (who will remain nameless for the sake of this review) uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past, inevitably involving Rick Deckard. Quite honestly, that\\'s the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience, so let\\'s get technical. If not for anything else, Blade Runner 2049 benefits from some of the best cinematography I\\'ve laid my eyes on in years. From the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects, to the mind- blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department, I have nothing but praise for this film. Whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience, the visuals alone should have you applauding, due to their incredibly detailed nature. I personally found the overall film to be magnificent, but when certain scenes were dialogue-free and asking you to gasp at the imagery, that\\'s exactly what I was doing, as I feel many audiences members will. Again, without giving anything away, once Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) enters the picture, the way both films sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion. It does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past, as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process. With a terrifically restrained performance by Ryan Gosling, you\\'ll find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall, as he uncovers these mysteries. With the addition of Harrison Ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances, as well as Ana de Armas in a role that really took me by surprise, this film was casted to the nines from beginning to end. Some may complain about Jared Leto and Dave Bautista not being included as much, but I felt as though the served the story quite nicely. In the end, this movie aims to impress Sci-Fi fans across the world, but I feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made, are those who\\'ve had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is 1982\\'s Blade Runner. I don\\'t say this about films very often, especially when talking about sequels, but I haven\\'t been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time. This is definitely a superior film than the original, it\\'s one of the best films of 2017, and I\\'ll be revisiting it very soon. Blade Runner 2049 is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across the world, and every bit of it is deserved. Aside from being very long, this is pretty much a perfect film if you don\\'t try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that aren\\'t blatantly answered. If you know what type of film you\\'re in for, or you\\'ve at least seen the original and enjoyed it, I can\\'t recommend this movie enough. Just slo-mo \\'acting\\' and movements with insider jokes to pretend they are clever.\\nCould someone point out why this Blade Runner and this blade runner exist? No? Didn\\'t think so.\\nPS: compare the music with this accounting ledger balance sheet line item with Vangelis\\' original.\\n2 stars for the poor and cute dog.Over and out. Blade Runner 2049 of course came with its own expectations and a bar that was set quite high. I was drawn in by the promise of that universe, the graphics and the giant holographic woman and was not disappointed. The CGI and the building, as well as the beautiful women were what I expected. I wish I had a \\'wife\\' that pretty.Unfortunately, again the bar was set high, but this film did not deliver. There are too many loose ends and the film does not give the audience a conclusion. The major surprise regarding replicants and what they can do is also a bridge too far. I do agree that the film is slow, which coupled with the lack of a conclusion brings my rating down.6/10 Not only it went against the prequel\\'s story, but also it left the door open for another film. Nothing happens in this after all. All they did is take our money, put us to sleep very likely and tell us to come back and give them more money for the inevitable sequel/franchise/universe/vomit.Here are things hinted at but not resolved: dystopia, army, child birth, successor, corporate corruption and of course lovers\\' relationship.Don\\'t give it your money. Three stars for the girlfriend\\'s eyes, hair, thighs and home cooking. Mainly because I fell asleep. Why is this film so boring? I mean aside from a menage a trois scene where the girlfriends are actually worth looking at everything else not only transpired so slowly it made little sense as well.Why anything on screen is happening boggles the mind. Ask yourself why any of the narrative is of consequence and there is a blank page as an answer. That is saying much in a film that tries to be profound. The rest: 0 starsBoringWell it is a sequel after all, what did I expect?Anyway, this makes no sense, the girl is hot but I do not understand the point of the film when the replicants are not replicants anymore. Let me describe the sequence of Blade Runner 2049 for youHere goes:Enter the cinema with an overpriced orange juice that is mandatory because in the last couple of years Hollywood has decided it is artsy and de rigueur to make films longer than 2 hours. The lights dim and commercials kick in for 10 minutes. A game for pre-teens wasting daddy\\'s money on mobile phones and plans kicks in. 2 minutes of endorsements for GM trucks (with some guy whose tone is so macho I roll my eyes) follows. Then there is a reminder to get the right debit card to be hip and in. Then the film follows for a whopping 3 hours almost. You would think that there was a lot happening and we were kept excited. Alas, the only thing that kept me awake was the very periodical appearance of a beautiful eye candy whether real, hologram or laser show version that would keep things exciting.If it were not for the sexy and lovable women Blade Runner 2049 was inane. Yes, inane. Apparently, not every film needs a sequel, a lesson Hollywood didn\\'t learn from Hangover.The script was so corny and the words so elementary one would be excused for thinking this is a practical joke. Head of police, yes head of police is told a big lie by a contractor, head of police believes it and all is good. No double checking, no verifying, no details asked no proof required. it is a matter of life and death for the order of the world and, of OK, let\\'s keep rolling guys. The ending was also a joke. A vehicle is drowning and the hero is being drowned but in the last second kills the bad gal and swims back to the vehicle to mount a rescue (for the sequels that will follow). Replicants can have and make babies, but how? Oh well, watch the prequel Blade Runner Rogue Uno, which is coming out in 2020.At that point all I wanted in life was to buy my own Joi and Luv and go back home. .... is only second to American remakes of foreign movies. When Hollywood remakes international movies my house begins to stink.With that said, sequels are a close second and this so-called Blade Runner shows why. In other words, Blade Runner 2049 is contradictory (pretty holographic wife cooking meals and showing skin... yeah earth sucks now, take that off worlders... yeah what a hell hole) and just a cash cow. Ridley Scott has finally ran out of different video versions of the original to release and people are sick of the alien prequels and sequels he kept pushing out (they all sucked) and so he\\'s back here.Get some integrity. My goodness how can you expect an audience to sit through three hours of mind numbing slow-mo contradictory conversations that make no sense and expect people to pay for the privilege.I guess, we should have known better since it is a sequel.All that rescued this film was several hard body, super thin, flaunting babes. Yup, those ashamed of the human body, nature and heterosexuality should stay away too. Otherwise, without the chicks the film would be a complete bust. The Force Awakens (2015) + Mr Sandman (the Lullaby 1954) = Blade Runner 2049. I still was bored. I am referring to the thin eye candies. The girlfriend and hooker were positively femininely beautiful and worth the price, but this is not a good movie. Outside the slender and flaunting body of the eye candies it quickly descends to boredom. I just kept rewinding to check out the actresses. Otherwise, zzzz First they make a film to put us to sleep. It is boring, slow, tedious and quite sleep-inducing. We fall asleep and catch up on some much needed rest.Then the \\'music\\' is a series of farts and tears and explosions and keeps waking me up. Look either get a soundtrack with music or skip it. What is with all the hi tech special effects\\' sounds instead of music??? I read that Ridley Scott likes to produce more of these. Please do not!\\nTerrible!It was so boring. I cannot believe they thought anyone would get through this overlong movie in a dark environment like a cinema. Perhaps that is why they had the \\'soundtrack\\' which was mostly explosive rip, tears and screeches instead of music to wake us up.I did enjoy the dog, the pretty girlfriend and the prostitute. Involving a couple of flaunting babies, but otherwise this film is stupid. Do you remember the criticism of the prequel where Rachel and Deckard ride into the sunset on a glorious road amidst beautiful nature? Right. Here too you can live in opulance in a casino and drink free whiskey and even have your own cute dog, etc.\\nSnore. What can I tell you? Sequels. The set design is fantastic, the girls are sexxxy and I love dogs. The poor dog!Is it trendy in Hollywood to not employ editors and have the film go on and on and on and on? What\\'s more it is a sequel. More about making money than creating a story. .. to come to think this is a good movie.The pretty women and fantasy are welcome and certainly a pleasant rarity in these anti-human body times, but this sequel (yup the problem right there) is boring and should not exist.It is forced, too long and the contrast to its prequel damning. Hollywood needs to stop making these meaningless sequels. They are for losers and only made for cash hoarding because if Hollywood was lacking cash it would not pay all these no-talents in the millions. At least this wasn\\'t anti-woman and anti-female and the women were hot and thin.\\nThey could have easily done a modern film where all the women are in baggy jump suits and obese and expect us to love it but at least they didn\\'t hate on slender and attractive women. That\\'s something these days.Of course it was a sequel and it was stupid and made little sense. I also have to say it is time for Ford to retire. Do you know why this is the worst sequel ever (aside from the crappy sequels from Disney)?\\nNot only it is too over-long and boring it also makes it beautiful prequel become less attractive to the viewers. That is criminal. Sure, the keywords on IMDB point out the chicks are pretty but that is not enough justification for more sequels or remakes.Hollywood, not every film needs a sequel. STOP. Blade Runner 2049 is not a good film, but it is not a complete disaster. A story that did not need telling and logically failed, an overlong and slow moving narrative and a massacre that makes no sense any longer were countered by original visuals and beautiful women. I will go with a rating of 4/10.The problems with this film is that it has sequeltitis. They came up with it because they needed to make money from a sequel and have no original ideas.\\nThe massacred are peaceful and are farming. Why do it then? The story moves so slowly that the 3 hours seem like 6. The acting is not good, but moderna ctors cannot touch older ones so that is par for the course. When in the original the performance by the chief of police, his goon, the industrialist and the eye maker would rivet and excite or the strong personality of the replicants would make the blood boil here it is a paint by the number series of appearances.With that said the futuristic society is fun to watch. Even more fun is Ana de Armas, the sexy and delicious hooker and even the legs of the Chief (who is old so has short hair unfortunately). These babes add to the vista and architecture that is most pleasing to the eye in this sequel. What was the point of this film? It was not entertaining, it was slow and it was sleep-inducing so there must be a plot or morality instead, right? Wrong.\\nThey are retiring peaceful and oppressed replicants while at the same time making even more.\\nConfused yet?YupLet me give you the reason why they needed this film. Hollywood needs sequels like Donald Trump needs porn stars with STD. Period. It is a disease and addiction for the weak.\\nPS: I asked my wife if she is into a menage a trois for us and said said no, but I know she was watching with interest so at least this film gave us an opening. I am leaving you. We are done. Your endless sequels and franchise movies are boring and uninspired. Frankly, forgive my crudeness, they all suck.\\nYou think bringing a couple of sexy babes into our lives will save our marriage. They do not. I watch the chicks, but I still know that you are boring and the fire and passion are gone.\\nTake care. After being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians - most notably \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Rocketman\" and \"Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story\" - it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict (though desirable) biographical approach. That is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous; I came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of The Beatles, and their music, through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all. Quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing.On another level, the film made a satire of the modern music industry. It revealed how the apparent \"solo\" artists are far from their titles; with huge teams of people pushing them in a preferred, and more commercial, creative direction, taking the musicians\\' creative power. This was done in a humorous light (as most themes are presented in the film). The romantic aspect of the film is evident from the beginning and is a dominant aspect of the story, possibly shifting the focus of the piece a little too much. However, it still helps provides a satisfying ending.The film pays a great amount of respect in a fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts. Refreshingly original and entertaining. The story flows and the characters are relatable and well developed. Not what I expected from the trailer but I liked it better than what I expected. So nice to see someone take a chance on an original story. The original premise of the movie was fantastic - only one man knows that The Beatles ever existed and brings their music to the world.It could have been really really great. Unfortunately the idea was under developed, it felt as if the film\\'s makers weren\\'t quite sure what to do with it.It ended up being \"nice\" and \"sweet\" when it could have been brilliant. I went into this wondering if they were going to explain the whole premise with it being a dream or such? Was he going to get caught and crucified for it? Was he going to get the girl, lose the girl? So many movies are fixated on realism and difficulties and negativity. Yes, he faces several difficulties. But, the movie is light and beautiful with fantastic music. If I want realism, I watch a documentary. This is what I go to the movies for. Really well done! There are some movies that when released simply don\\'t need a big marketing campaign. Just a few words of description of the plot are enough to put it on your \"must see\" list: \"A struggling musician has a cycling accident during a freak global blackout and wakes to a world where noone other than him remembers the Beatles or any of their songs.\" When I heard this I said to myself \"yes, Yes, YES\"! But would it live up to my expectations?This is a Richard Curtis penned film, and that\\'s immediately enough to put a tranche of movie-goers off. All his movies have an accent on the uplifting, the positive and/or the whimsical, and I can understand why that winds some people up. If \"Richard-Curtissy\" was an adjective, and I think it should be, many of these films can be so classified.Here, although again very Richard-Curtissy, I think he gets the mixture JUST RIGHT.... \"Yesterday\", for me, was a complete joy from beginning to end.I imagine Curtis getting this story from a rowdy dinner party round his gaff. He asks his guests, over the third bottle of dessert wine, to play a wild and fantastical \"what if\" game (in pursuit of the \"very good\" spare brownie of course). At this particular event, I guess it was co-story-author Jack Barth (in his movie-writing debut) that made the successful attempt to \"hog the brownie\". For the premise of \"Yesterday\" is quite brilliant, whilst at the same time being utterly bonkers too!That being said, the story is not completely original. I thought there were many similarities to the Ricky Gervais vehicle of 2009, \"The Invention of Lying\", where Gervais alone finds he suddenly has the ability to tell lies, and finds ill-gotten fortune and fame as a result. Much like that earlier film, much of the joy here is in the recognition of the gift given and the dawning realisation of what this might actually mean to him. As such, I found the first half of the film a lot more enjoyable than the second.The conundrum facing Jack is to remeber all of the Beatles songs and their lyrics (without having Google as a reference), and much fun is had with him stumbling into situations that suddenly remind him of a new track or a particular snatch of lyric.There is of course an obvious explanation for the whacky storyline, since the hero has received a potentially serious head injury. But would the film go there? (No spoilers here).Himesh Patel is from TV\\'s \"Eastenders\" but here makes his movie debut. He is perfectly cast as Jack Malik: in the film, he\\'s a name about to rise from utter obscurity as a Lowestoft retail assistant to global superstardom. Patel is charming and believable as he squirms with his conscience. A surprising and touching beach scene in the final reel of the film is exquisitely acted.The ever-watchable and utterly gorgeous Lily James here goes brunette: she was actually unrecognisable to me from both the trailer and the poster! Here she makes a very believable high-school teacher with a side-line in management and roadie-ing.I found Ed Sheeran\\'s cameo in \"Bridget Jones Baby\" to be excruciating! But here, in what is quite an extensive part, he is much, much better. I think he\\'s been getting lessons.One of the slight disappointments with the film is that it is a Danny Boyle film that doesn\\'t FEEL like a Danny Boyle film. Aside from some inventive on-screen titles, I didn\\'t detect much of the stylisation that I would expect from one of his films. Yes, there are occasional flashes of genius - for example, the scenes where Malik is desperately trying to remember the lyrics of Eleanor Rigby, and those of him watching, big screen, his own social-media led rise to super stardom. But otherwise, the visuals and storyline are pretty linear in nature.Although there are cloyingly gooey bits of this film, the element that weaves it all together - such that \"all is forgiven\" in my book - is the magical music and lyrics of McCartney, Lennon and Harrison.Was there a better year to be born that 1961? (Well, possibly the mid- to late- 50\\'s so you were old enough to remember more of it). But although only a child aged between two and nine during their album releases, I felt the benefit of three older siblings who WERE able to fully embrace Beatlemania. And the film delights with its modern day recreations of the classic tracks and, as already mentioned, Himesh Patel belts them out wonderfully (especially, I thought, with \"Help!\").I can\\'t not give this one 10 stars. I simply loved it, and can\\'t wait for its general release (in the UK, on June 28th 2019) so I can go and love it all over again. Is it technically a 10-star film? Possibly not, but sometimes you just have to go with the way a film makes you feel, not just as you walk, whistling, out of the cinema but for the whole of the next 48 hours and (I suspect) longer. In summary, he loves it. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeeaaaaaah\".(This is an edited version. The full graphical review is available on \"One Mann\\'s Movies\" on t\\'internet or Facebook. Please consider checking it out. Thanks!) It was a great idea and in some ways the film made the vision work. I just don\\'t think they did enough with it though and instead fell back into the traditional love story formula. The music helped carry a lot of it through (unsurprisingly). What they missed was it wasn\\'t necessarily the songs themselves but the era in which they came out and the meaning of the time. Movie just presented it as almost instant stardom if today\\'s world heard the songs which lets be honest today\\'s generation wouldn\\'t understand half of it. It didn\\'t really present a clear vision of \"why\" which I was looking for towards the end to help tie things up. Lights go off on the planet he takes a bump on the head then the Beatles never existed? Alternate universe? Dream? Thought there would\\'ve been something more there. There were a few things that bothered me with the story that the movie made it seem like they were pieces to the puzzle but then never did anything with them. First is through the film he also finds out other things don\\'t exist as well such as coke, cigarettes, the band oasis, and Harry Potter. It seemed like these things were going to connect into the story and why the Beatles music isn\\'t present but they just left it there and he kind of says \"oh well\" and nothing comes of it. The second was he finds out there are two others that also know the Beatles music and again seems like this should be a big part of the story to tie things together as to a bit of \"why\" but they just have a conversation about it she gives him an address and then that\\'s it. His conversation with what I think is supposed to be John Lennon didn\\'t make sense either. Does that mean the other 4 exist? Did they never meet to make music? Just all added up to a great idea that worked early in the film but didn\\'t follow through properly. All my opinion of course Just left the TriBeCa Film Festival where the film premiered, and I have to say, the film was superb. Everyone in the film is outstanding and Danny Boyle does a brilliant job handling some of the greatest songs ever written. Speaking of that, The Beatles legacy will forever live on with this film. YesterdaySo much of this movie was charming, brilliantly acted, and inventive, however somewhere around the middle of the movie, (the missing the train scene) it just turned into a big farce. The plot just became unbelievable, it also turned corny and over-sentimental. Of course I accept the whole movie was built on supernatural premise but what follows must hang together and keep the audience rooting for our hero.What was good:1, I loved the music, I think this made the movie.2, Jack Malik, played by Himesh Patel, did a fine job, he has mastered irony and deadpan, we were all wanted this antihero to have his dream.What was challenging;1, the plot was either so corny or so contrived, some plot twists were just unnecessary and added nothing.2, Elle, played by Lily James, lost our sympathy, she was presented as needy and pathetic and just as the culmination of him achieving \"their\" dream, she tries to make him choose between his dream and her.3, The conclusion was unsatisfactory, he wanted to be a musician and was fabulous at it, he ended up a teacher, big mistake.Overall, the was an overly contrived feel good movie, I enjoyed whilst I was watching it, but feel cheated and unsatisfied at the end. Saw it at my cinema in Lovran, Croatia just a few hours ago, so it\\'s still pretty \"fresh\" while I\\'m writing this.\\nThe whole idea is great, haven\\'t seen those yet in mainstream cinema. The plot is pretty much straight-forward, with likeable characters, great music (of course) and when the movie was over, it left me with good feeling and a smile on my face still singing Hey Jude.All actors are really good, but Lily James is so adorable in this movie! She shines in her character and steals every scene she is in. Liked her the most (obviously).Take your girlfriend/boyfriend/friends/family to see this rom-com fantasy music comedy in cinema on a big screen, and even if you won\\'t like the movie, you will sing Beatles songs after and feel good about it (guaranteed)! What a great premise totally wasted by a mediocre screenplay.\\nActing is good, but everything else falls flat. Sheeran\\'s participation doesn\\'t really make any sense. He should\\'ve been just a cameo...All in all, a big disappointment. There were three main reasons really in seeing \\'Yesterday\\'. The alternative world scenario sounded truly fascinating, one of the most fascinating concepts in recent years to me and a refreshing change from the remakes and sequels constantly made today. Like to love a lot of Danny Boyle\\'s previous films and find him a talented director. The Beatles are not all time favourites but do appreciate him highly, understand their influence in music and like a lot of their songs a lot.While it could have done more with its concept, \\'Yesterday\\' turned out to still be entertaining and charming that put me and my sister in an uplifting mood leaving the cinema. Had not had an easy day, or week even, up to seeing the film, so \\'Yesterday\\' was a much needed and appreciated antidote. As far as films released in 2019 go, it is neither one of the best or worst in a hit and miss year and somewhere around solid middle if having to rank.\\'Yesterday\\' is a slick looking film, not exemplary but never cheap. Lily James looks great and the camera clearly loves her. The music of course is fantastic, it is The Beatles after all, with some of their greatest hits exuberantly performed, making one want to sing along regardless of whether they know all the words or not. \"Hey Jude\" is one of the most memorable examples. The script balances amusing comedy and never over-sentimental drama without making it too cartoonish or mawkish (well mostly).Story-wise, \\'Yesterday\\' captures the feel-good spirit affectionately and the portrayal of the music industry was fun and didn\\'t get over the top. The John Lennon bit is a highlight. Boyle has done better and more inspired direction, but still directs at a crisp pace and balances things quite well. The performances are good, a truly charming James coming off best. Himesh Patel has come on a long way since \\'EastEnders\\' while Kate McKinnon is riotous in the manager role.On the other viewpoint, the concept was so fascinating and while it is always engaging the story is predictable and a bit too ordinary. Especially the final third, which is pretty much exactly as one would expect.Ed Sheeran\\'s \"extended cameo\" for my tastes was rather puzzling and didn\\'t seem to gel with everything else.All that aside, it was an enjoyable film on the whole and worth seeing. 7/10 Yesterday is pure cinematic fluff with a lightning-bolt of an idea. In moments, those substance-less joys earn their cuteness. But, as with writer Richard Curtis\\'s other films (About Time), there\\'s a unique ethical question underscoring the surface: what rights does an artist have over a creation they didn\\'t create? Should we be honest about \"reality\" when that reality isn\\'t reality? Confused? Don\\'t worry; that complexity is all but completely brushed under the rug here, opting instead for cheap explanations and corny romance.\\nBecause of unimportant and uninteresting reasons, an aspiring musician (Patel) discovers he is the only person in the world who remembers The Beatles. Patel is great in the lead; with impeccable timing and effortless charm, he manages to steal all these classic songs without losing our sympathy. He\\'s supported by a handful of genuinely funny and sweet moments: jokes at the expense of Oasis and Ed Sheeran, the reveals of other erased cultural touchstones (Coca-Cola, Harry Potter, etc), even a surprisingly moving reveal of others who remember the past. Unfortunately, the story doesn\\'t do much to help. Lazy storytelling shortcuts are taken at every turn, making a fantastical concept even more difficult to believe.\\nCurtis is usually quite adept with this type of rom-dramedy, but he\\'s not at the helm here. Boyle is, and he\\'s known for his hyper-stylized direction, which proves problematic. Where he spends time working on montages of ridiculous metaphorical storytelling devices, he should be fleshing out character motivations and ethical conundrums. Yesterday makes me glad we live in a reality with The Beatles, so we can ignore this movie and stay home to listen to Abbey Road. Hey, there is a moment in every one\\'s life when you need a break, and you need to remember that life can be simple, can be romantic, can be wistful, can be about remembering what matters and why.\\nThis movie is not about fixing the world or fixing the audience, it is about bringing a smile to your face while providing a special pleasure that we did not know we were missing out on: the one that allow us to revel in the sound, poetry and consciousness of one of the most iconic band the music scene has known.\\nI enjoyed the movie with my kid, who used to sing the Beatles when she was a toddler and that turned into a teenager not particularly interested in the music her parent enjoyed, who had as much a blast as I did during the movie.\\nThe acting rand true, the emotion were genuine and the music was a blast, there is absolutely no reason to miss out on this cool concept and movie. To cut a long story short, with a film directed by Danny Boyle and based on a legendary band such as The Beatles, I was expecting significantly better, although the movie is definitely not bad. The love story between Jack Malik and Ellie Appleton is excellently interpreted by Himesh Patel and the gorgeous Lily James, while Kate McKinnon vervely interprets a sickening impresario. But the movie is globally disappointing with a certain flatness and a script suffering from a blatant lack of originality: the « Twilight Zone » effect has been seen again and again so many times. In fact, by being slightly in bad faith, the film Yesterday (2019) can almost be reduced to the Beatles songs. I am fully aware of the exaggeration, but allow me to moan and groan: I\\'m slightly disappointed with such a banal rom com about The Beatles, a stuff of legend across all periods of time. I liked it. It was a refreshing change from the blockbuster superhero genre that is choking society.\\nJack\\'s struggle with the dishonesty was obvious throughout the film. The music was superb. Ed Sheeran\\'s portrayal of himself was super cute.\\nI was a little worried the writer would take it over the top and Ed would decide Jack was better than he and decide to stop making music. I am very glad they didn\\'t go there with the story.\\nJack coming clean near the end and the way he did it, was a good ending for me.\\nAlso the fact that The Beatles were not the only thing/person to disappear during the blackout was a fun touch.\\nAll in all, It was an emotional, fun, twist of a movie. This film is an absolutely beautiful story that depicts the Beatles\\' success in such a unique and brilliant way.Himesh Patel (Jack Malik) has an incredible voice and is absolutely perfect for his role. Lily James (Ellie Appleton) is also the perfect person for her role as she depicts a very sweet school teacher who has been desperate for Jack to love him since they met. This is also why the romantic element in this film is flawless and heartwarming, particularly towards the end of the film.The film is also very funny and all the cast do an excellent job of making the audience laugh. Ed Sheeran (playing himself) is hilarious and I am very glad that he agreed to be a part of this film.Do you enjoy the Beatles and their songs? Comedy? Romance? Fantasy? If you enjoy any of these things, I guarantee you will love this film and I recommend you see it as soon as possible! What a sweet, wonderful film. Even if you didn\\'t grow up with The Beatles music like I did, you should have a great appreciation for this film. Whoever came up with the idea is a genius. The acting is wonderful, the direction seems to be having as much fun as the actors are, the music is, well, mostly The Beatles, but with new and fun arrangements that pay so much honor to the originals. And with the sweet little twists, this movie does have a simple, but touching moral. Plus you\\'ve got Kate McKinnon, who can read a phone book and be amazing (you kids under 35 won\\'t know what a phone book is).If you need two hours to forget about all the bad things in this world or in your life and to just feel happy, go see this movie! After Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman. Yesterday is the next movie based on the classic song sang by a classic musicians. But unlike Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman which are biography movies. Yesterday is a fantasy comedy movie which is a different take from the previous two. Did the movie deliver or did the movie disappoint. After seeing the first trailer back in February I was very interested in the its unique concept of the movie.The plot for the movie centers around Jack Malek who is a struggling musician until he had a bus crash while power was turned off about 12 seconds he then finds out that he is the only person who knows the songs of the Beatles.The movie delivered on its premised in a lot of levels. The performances by Himesh Patel and Lily James was excellent they had great chemistry and you can feel their friendship grew throughout the movie. I thought Ed Sheeran wasn\\'t that bad in the movie and he was a lot better than I expecting considering that most real life musicians acting was mostly bad. The movie featured lots of classic Beatles which was great even though Let It Be was on briefly I was expecting a full version of the record in the movie. But that didn\\'t ruin the whole movie. The ending of movie was very moving and emotional don\\'t going to say anything about the ending but it was lovely ending.Overall the movie was excellent it was original but unlike a lot of original movies that has a great premise but didn\\'t deliver this movie does deliver with great performances and a wonderful ending this movie is to enjoy by everyone who loves the the Beatles or just want to have a great fun time at the cinema. I highly recommend it. I\\'m no film buff. This ticked all my boxes. Great music, and every emotion covered. It\\'s not deep but in its own way it digs deeper than most. Love, love love it! Of course the film is packaged within the most basic, cliched even, romcom format. Childhood sweethearts never expressed love for each other, then something happens, their relationship gets strained, until love wins and is declared publicly.This isn\\'t a whodunnit, you can guess the ending from the trailer. You will have seen countless films like this and you come to expect everything that happens to happen. Just as you expect a chorus after a verse in a Beatles song. Or any other pop song.But within that outer layer there is a very interesting subject that the film explores: what if we lost something that brings us all together? What if we didn\\'t have a shared cultural experience to which we all give the same meaning?When the blackout happens, the Beatles are not the only thing that disappears from public memory: Jack googles \"coke\" and the search engine - which is what gives Meaning these days - displays a picture of Pablo Escobar. So when Jack asks a waitress for coke, it is not a ubiquitous beverage that the woman thinks of.And so Jack finds himself with the opportunity to gain fame and riches by appropriating what had been a pillar of our post-war popular culture globally: the Beatles catalogue. Because the true premise of the film is this: everyone likes the Beatles. And Beatles songs therefore can be used by us all to communicate with each other.Soon though Jack finds that the music has lost its universal meaning for the people who now appreciate \"his\" music. He is confronted with the ruthless pragmatism of the music industry, all the while being isolated by his alien cultural baggage and climb to fame.So when he reunites with the only two other people unaffected by the blackout, he finds that meaning again, and the plot finally twists.This isn\\'t a film about the Beatles\\' music, it isn\\'t a documentary about their legacy - it\\'s a film about a world suddenly losing shared experience, about losing a \"consensus\" that brought us together.That\\'s why I thought the ending, the other part of the ending, the one I\\'m not going to spoil, was so uplifting and progressive. Go watch it. I liked it! I was twelve when the Beatles became famous so I grew up with them. More than once a tear threatened to roll down my cheek but I\\'m a simple lass so what the hell! I\\'m no big-arsed critic who is paid to be clever and differant. I thought the writing and the acting was spot on. As someone whose had a bit of success, I appreciated that a great deal. Very authentic I thought. But here\\'s the thing; about that cameo... I won\\'t say who it is but when it happened, my jaw hit the floor. Amazing! Well done. And so, so sad.\\nGreat film. I\\'ll definitely buy the DVD.\\nAs an aside, if we are supposed to write twenty lines at least in these reviews, how come some of these reviews only contain two lines? Danny Boyle is a director that I usually like, but unfortunately this film disappointed me. I thought it was very cliched and filled to the brim with tropes and bad, cringeworthy dialogue. I thought the acting was good, and the premise was interesting, but they don\\'t live up to the potential of that premise. Because rather than exploring the interesting questions that this premise entails like how the world, the music industry, and our understanding of music would change if The Beatles were never a thing, they instead just use this as a strange, needlessly complex way of telling a by the books romance. Overall I wouldn\\'t exactly recommend this film, and I was pretty disappointed. Sat with a big smile on my face the entire time. \"A world without The Beatles is a world that is infinitely worse\" Yesterday tells the story of Jack, an amateur musician who is trying to break into the industry with the help of his best friend Ellie, but when he gets hit by a truck riding his bike home one night, he wakes up in an alternate universe where several things have turned out to have never existed, but most importantly the Beatles and their songs. Jack decides to take advantage of this, and uses the Beatles\\' music to launch his career, becoming the most famous pop star in the world.That premise sounds great, and I was looking forward to a surreal comedy, but to be honest, it doesn\\'t quite live up to it, instead getting distracted by what the actual main plot turned out to be: a cliche romantic comedy with the childhood friend that is secretly in love with the protagonist, only for him to figure it out for himself later.The best moments of this film are to do with the central premise of the alternate universe, where Jack would reference something, only for the people around him to say \"what\\'s that?\" I mean, it\\'s the same joke in different words basically every time, but hey, the way they execute it is pretty good. There are also some decent satirical moments with Jack interacting with the music industry, personified by Jack\\'s manager, and an extended cameo by Ed Sheeran, who falls victim to some self-deprecating jokes, but overall seems to be the secondary \\'star\\' of the show besides the Beatles\\' music.Speaking of the Beatles, you\\'d be surprised by how little they actually contribute to the plot. For a film that is named after one of their more famous songs, you\\'d think that their music and impact to society would be more than just a plot device for the main character to achieve his success. There\\'s no real commentary as to why the Beatles music is so great, you\\'re just told, over and over again, that they\\'re the greatest band ever, and that a world without them ever existing would suck. Sure, that is something I would agree with, but the film doesn\\'t really add much of their own perspective to that side of the story, it just takes that idea as fact.The romance is decent, but cliche and overall unremarkable. Screenwriter Richard Curtist definitely knows how to write romances, having written several well regarded romcoms, like Love Actually and About Time, but I would say that Yesterday isn\\'t quite up to that standard. Same goes for Danny Boyle and the other films he directed compared to this. The direction isn\\'t bad, but it\\'s bland and doesn\\'t really add much to the story. There are some weird shots, like some weird dutch angles near the beginning of the story that seem out of place, but nothing else unusual or amazing about the camerawork either.I guess if you like romcoms and Beatles music, this movie will definitely be watchable, but for me, as a person who doesn\\'t actively seek out that genre, this film didn\\'t stand out to me in either direction, and overall I\\'m disappointed that they didn\\'t take full advantage of the great premise. Yesterday is so fun to watch, I loved every moment of it. So good to finally see a film that isn\\'t a remake or a sequel. Himesh Patel and Lily James were brilliant and relatable. I loved their chemistry.\\nLoved all the music obviously!! how can you not. The Beatles are the biggest selling band in the world, if they didn\\'t exist the world deservers to hear their music.\\nHowever above all loved the underlying message; success doesn\\'t also have to be about the money you make and tell the truth at every possible opportunity you get.I can\\'t wait for this film to be released on DVD so I can watch it again and again. If you go into this expecting a $100 million action blockbuster you will be dissapointed. What this film delivers is a solid crime drama with some gritty and tense action scenes.\\nA strong lead performance by Joel Kinnaman holds the story together and the film moves swiftly at a pace that never drags.\\nIf you want a film that gives you actual story over mindless hollywood CGI action, then give this one a chance. If I had read the critics I would have ignored this film.I read a good review in The Sunday Express and went to see the film and liked it a lot.I will give no plot spoilers but if you like tough but not dumb crime films you will like this one.\\nIt does not have the biggest budget or the biggest action sequences but it is a good film.The plot is fine but the film also benefits from good locations and a talented cast.See this if you get the chance I think you will be glad you did. I\\'ve never heard of this film, nor seen any trailers, so I wasn\\'t expecting much and decided to give it a go since there wasn\\'t anything I haven\\'t already seen to watch. Well, wow!I\\'m shocked at some of the negative reviews so far. It goes to show you that you can\\'t please everyone. It\\'s either too Hollywood-ish or not Hollywood enough lol.Here\\'s why I REALLY liked it; For starters, this is actor Andrea Di Stefano second ever attempt at directing and writing, and compared to some of the films that have come out lately - and from seasoned writer and directors, he nailed it. Was it flawless? No. But considering is wasn\\'t a big budget Hollywood production with seasoned filmmakers and with all lead cast being A-listers, but instead a British-made B-grade film with newb filmmakers, this was produced exceptionally well and is a winner imo.I found the story very realistic and un-Hollywood-ish, which is refreshing for a change. Sure this story has been done many times before, but this one felt authentic. The last time I saw this type of genre movie that surprised and impressed me, was Shot Caller.Casting was perfect, with all leads playing their respective roles on point, especially Joel Kinnaman who nailed his character.Cinematography was great, the score/sound was fitting, and the production/location sets authentic. My only critique would be the pacing needed picking up in some parts, and/or the 113 min run-time trimmed down at least 10-15 mins.Aside from that, this was one of the best B-grade films I\\'ve seen, with its unpredictable plot turn at every corner, excellent central performances, all packaged really well by an newbie filmmaker. It\\'s a solid 9/10 from me!To see any of my 1000+ ratings and 700+ reviews, click on my username. Great acting(wife could have been better), many intense moments and simple, believable script. All of us have seen at least one similar movie in our lifes so dont expect anything new as I do think this movie is just meant to make your heart pump faster. If you have seen the trailer this film does what it says on the tin. It is a decent cop/bad guy film that is a little different in its storyline.The film rattles along a decent pace and has some good scenes. There is some quite good suspense and action along the way as well.Where the film is let down is the ending is just so clear, aside from a tiny twist, from about half way through the film and even then, when it happens it\\'s quite a damp squib. There are also parts of the story that just don\\'t stack up, which is a shame as it has good potential. What a nice change to get away from the \\'typical\\' Holywood action flick and to get into a grittier, morally ambiguous, uncompromising drama. Rosamund Pike continues to prove what a great actor she is with a performance that echoes her character in Beirut. Joel Kinnaman gives a performance that is just as conflicted and compelling as Altered Carbon. Altogether a great cast that manages to build realistic characters. My only criticism of the script is the overly detailed explanation of fentanyl that Pike gives to her team on FBI agents - it\\'s the only point where you feel the film patronises the audience. Other than that, a thoroughly enjoyable movie. The Informer is an enjoyable and well made thriller, despite the generic plot and some predictable moments. Joel Kinnaman gives a great lead performance with good supporting performances from Common, Rosamund Pike, Clive Owen and Ana de Armas. It\\'s also well paced with an intense fight scene and tense gunfight in the third act. If you like action films with good story plus good acting this is the one for you. Personally I really enjoyed this movie and I would go again to it. An absorbing thrill ride of a crime thriller. Unlike some reviewers I actually found this well paced with enough twists to keep it interesting and a ruthless violent edge alongside the drama. Was tempted to even rate as a 9 until near the end but I just can\\'t stand open endings to these things no matter how minor unless we know there\\'ll be a sequel I just want to know how the story is resolved fully. Nevertheless one of the better thrillers of the year so far and well worth a watch. This is not normally my kind of movie but I quite enjoyed it. The characters all felt pretty realistic, the actors all did a decent job and the story was compelling.It did feel a bit slow at points and I think maybe a little careful trimming could have done the film some good but even so it keeps you engaged and doesnt leave itself too open to easy prediction as you watch.Worth a watch I would say. Started out kinda strong, but quickly fizzled out.\\nI was surprised to see such good actors in this mediocre film, except for Common- he can\\'t act himself out of a paper bag.In the end it was a disappointment. Great, absorbing thriller with good guys, bad guys and guys somewhere in the middle. Sicario 2 was the last one that I enjoyed as much as this. It was like reading an Elmore Leonard story but without the humour. I understand that the UK did a good job of standing in for New York. What a surprise because it did feel like the Big Apple. I liked the flow of the film. You did not always follow what was going on - I\\'m still not sure of the role played by the drugs in the tulips - but the scenes did not linger. The film was a little open-ended. If the make The Informer 2, I would buy a ticket for it. The informer\\n2019\\n15\\ndirector: Andrea De stefano\\nstarring: Joel Kinnamon,Rosamund pike,Ana de armas,Common,Clive own etcoverall rating 73/100When ex convict Pete coslow gets involved with a shooting of a NYPD cop. He has to go back to prison in order to stop a drug gang from getting away with there crimes. But the lifes of his wife and child is at risk and its up to officer wilcox ( rosamund pike) to help him be reunited with his family. The informer was a good thriller but a flawed film, but still thoroughly entertaining lets get into why this is.First of all the film did a fantastic job of delivering an incredibly tense tone. The film did a fantastic job with keeping you on the edge of your seat. in fact i think this is up there with the most tense and unsettling films of the year in my opinion. The film just put the audience through so many uncomfortable situations. and with the lack of soundtrack it really helped with the authenticity of the film. Whether it was being attacked in the prison or in my opinion the most uncomfortable scene when the main characters wife and child was being gagged and threatened. Also the violence and gore helped with the entertainment value of the film. But also added to the tense tone and impact of each scene with a heads up some very gory things that were borderline 18 rating in my opinion.however my first issue is the slow pacing in the first half of the film. In my opinion the first half of the film was very slow and made me lose interest a few times. There was just a lot of filler conversations and standing around that left me needing something to spice the film up and make it more entertaining. But luckily they more then redeemed themselves in the second half of the film where it had a absolutely fantastic final act. They really went all out in the last half of the film to make you care about all of the characters and to keep you on the edge of your seat. With all the action was non stop within the last 30/45 minutes of the film so this more then made up for the first half of the film.Next i think the informer had a good amount of emotional weight to it. The fact that Joel Kinnamons character. Just wanted to get to his family and the love he showed them really made his character more respected in my opinion. And you related to him a bit more because most people are close to there families so being away from them is hard so everyone could\\npassively relate to his emotional state with his wife and kid.Next i think they really portrayed the harsh reality of prison life really well. A lot of films with prisons in can be very tame with what they show maybe due to the age rating but this film. Showed the types of people the horrible conditions that prisoners rightly have to go through so this was just a nice touch to see. However i do have to say that the film was very stereotypical with what type if inhabitants take up prisons. I think having a lot of the prisoners black and to have it split by colour is fairly old fashioned and they should of picked a more diverse group of people.Now my final two positives would be the fantastic acting was Joel Kinnamon and Rosamund pike. Rosamund pike was fantastic in the cop role. She was clever and did not take no for a answer whilst also having a kind heart and a nag for doing the right thing. And joel Kinnamon showed great diversity in the film. His character had a great blend of intimidation,vulnerability and perseverance and despite maybe not agreeing with some of his actions largely he was a character that you could support.However i do have to end on my final two negatives. First of all there was next to no character development or depth to most of the characters. Most of the characters were very one dimensional. And Petes wife did next to nothing in the film apart from being Petes motivation she was just a damsel in distress which was a shame considering the films of today with strong female characters. And finally there was some incredibly dislikable characters. Some of joels workmates who killed policemen and threatened his wife and kid were just sick and really made you not like there characters. I know this was the goal but for whatever reason something was off about some of the characters that really made you question the reasoning for them being there in the script.Overall the informer is a thoroughly entertaining and tense thriller with excellent acting. But is narratively flawed and could used with more developed and likeable characters. Joel Kinnaman is about the only thing holding this together. He\\'s an excellent actor and if you like him, this is worth watching. the movie is at times suspenseful but Hollywood seems to have given up on creating anything even slightly realistic. This movie is absurd and as it goes on, only gets more absurd. Towards the end I was actually laughing which isn\\'t a good sign when the movie is suppose to be a dramatic thriller. Worth a watch for Joel or if you have nothing else to watch. An unremarkable action thriller which isn\\'t particularly good or bad, just mediocre. It\\'s a bit boring at times, a bit too cliché at times and a bit implausible at times, but the story is gritty, the action scenes are well put together and the acting and characters are good, if a bit 1 dimensional. From the team that brought you Sicario comes another drug fuelled thriller with an amazing cast although set in the USA was filmed on location in the UK And is a UK production .Rosamund Pike plays \\'Emily Blunt\\' who was missing from Sicario 2 hence why that was so poor in comparison to the first .This one is based on the Polish mafia operating in NYC .Good tension , good story , great acting , stand out performance for me was the rapper Common as the NYPD detective with the street cred and look to make him a star in his own right .Central to the theme was family and the love of man for his wife and daughter and vice versa caught up in a web of crime he never deserved to be in .It\\'s one those films where the natural good guys and bad guys were twisted to make it more interestingAn enjoyable film with a little bit of violence but appropriate to the plot .Worth seeing .Pad.A 9/10 The premise of the film is decent but the execution is woeful. The story revolves around a military veteran involved in a drug ring being investigated by the FBI and the NYPD.Unfortunately virtually no time is spent on character introduction / development which makes it hard to care about any of the main protagonists. It\\'s just a series of improbable scenes which bear virtually no relation to each other. It doesn\\'t help that the audio mixing is terrible rendering much of the dialogue unintelligible.Joel Kinnaman does his best to portray a believable character, but Clive Owen is his usual wooden self. The other characters are completely forgettable.This could have been a decent film but the production and editing are dreadful and completely fail to tell a compelling or even coherent story. 2/10 and that\\'s being generous. This movie is a prime example of a terrible script screwing up a film.\\nThe acting is good and the directing okay but the story is so bad that you stop believing in the horrible plot, and they add a terrible finale that suspends any chance of belief that you just laugh and smirk that anyone thought this was a good idea of a story line. Plus the ending is so preposterous it feels like it is a tv series with a part 2 To be Continued.\\nAs if this piece of crap would have a sequel....\\nA 5 for the acting I really enjoyed it, it is one of the best movies I have seen for a long time. I did not watch the trailer and probably this was helpful. Sometimes trailers tells you everything in advance and according to a few comments this is whats happening here aswell. So don\\'t watch the trailer just go and enjoy this exciting movie with excellent actors. The InformerI really had high hopes for this movie and some things were good but overall so many aspects were just unsatisfactory and not thought through.What was good,1. The acting was first rate except perhaps for Joel Kinnaman who had the look but mumbled his way through a very stiff performance. Not a good start as in many ways the film rested on him.2, the cinematography was good and helped the tension and narrative flow.What was problematic1, too little variety in the movie, all we had was threat menace and betrayal2, the plot was labyrinthine, keep it simple.3, some of the turns were ridiculous, the NYPD cop arrived on his own to sort out a shoot out. The FBI had authority to act and then tried to conceal their actions. Criminal gangs rarely accept new members so the police try to turn existing members. The hostage scene was absurd as any idiot can spot a prisoner from a guard.4, the informer\\'s wife Sophia had the acting skills of a dead ant, the AB school of acting.5, the clash of theatre and method acting was so marked I laughed aloud.This was a boys movie with questionable acting and an absurd script, such a shame when you consider the calibre of actors involved. First found Joel Kinnaman in The Killing and have always really liked his acting. He is a very strong actor, and really enjoyed his role in this movie. It has some strong action sequences with the right amount of drama. Would recommend this film, for sure!! Great complex storyline but easy to follow. Very good film with superb acting. Confused why the rating isn\\'t higher yet. Pete (Joel Kinnaman ) is working an an informer for the FBI. Their goal is to take down \"The General\" and his drug operation. The plan had to be aborted when a cop was killed. The General wants Pete to go to prison and run a drug operation. The FBI thinks it is a good idea for him to go to prison and get the details. Things don\\'t go well while he is in prison either.This is a me-too crime film. Pike is better as a \"Gone\" girl than an FBI agent. The whole film had a me-too aspect to it.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. My heart pumping all the time ..\\nI need to see the next what will happen :( Enjoyable, entertaining thriller. Worth a watch. Good acting.'],\n",

But it just felt like the intro to the story itself.Binge watching is done easily and quickly with seven 22 minutes episodes on average which just felt like 3 at the most or a 153 minutes movie.At the end i just asked myself, why they didn\\'t go on so that the story gets told?! Couldn\\'t they finish in time?!That\\'s the only reason, i just gave it 7 stars. Now we have to wait up to a year for the continuation.Everything else was really good. Great show for someone who has grown up with Stephen King stories, Carrie and Breakfast Club. Building up the characters takes time, and I see that some other viewers think it is too slow - but I like the story been build up from layer to layer. Nice start for an interesting story... And great work from young stars! Bingeworthy perfect length 7 episodes ..strong performances...with a cliffhanger which makes me want season 2 right now.. Ive watched this in one sitting, it just grabs you and Sophia Lillis is just mesmerazing imo. loved every minute of this show and dying to see if second season will be made :) I am not Okey with this, because I am desperately waiting for the second season. I found the show entertaining and fun. However, 20 minute episodes?? With a total runtime of just over 2 hours, with a little more editing it may have just been a better movie. I don\\'t see the point of 7 different 20 minute episodes. I hope there is a season 2 but I hope they add a little more substance. From the start you know exactly how it ends, this takes nothing away from the series at all, there\\'s enough going on to keep you interested from start to finish and the length and pacing is absolutely spot on!It touches on all the usual high school phase issues and deals with them in the right way as not to offend anyone but more to add comfort to anyone that goes through these problems as a youngster. (Minus the super hero stuff ;-)As the title says it\\'s not original we have seen all aspects of this type of series before, for me it was a bit like watching the end of the fucking world, sex education with some super hero twist. What more can you want?Loved it, the only way to watch is in one sitting. Look forward to more. I watched all 7 episodes in one sitting and really liked it! The overall pacing and the writing was what in my opinion made it work. The actors were all great too and i especially thought that Wyatt Oleffs performance as Stanley Barber was amazing!\\nThe ending was also brilliant!\\nI am looking forward to season 2 I am not OK with this,hit\\'s hard but thanks to Sophia lilies electrifying performance with each episode passing you\\'ll demand for More. This show was a mix of cliché and originality. On one hand you have interesting plots for episodes, crazy situations, and twists and turns, and I\\'m the other you have predictable plots and writing. The acting was great, they made a smart move by getting actors that have worked on projects previously, and Wyatt Olef is perfect for his role. I enjoyed Sofia\\'s performance as well, she really sold me on her character and her ability to change from being an angry or rude character to a charming and like able one is extremely impressive. I also loved Sofia Bryant, she was great for her role. All the acting was amazing so props to the casting director. One of my main complaints is the inconsistency with the episodes, some of the, were great, some were okay, and some I didn\\'t like very much. This wouldn\\'t be a problem if there were more episodes, but considering there are only 7 it was not convenient. The series doesn\\'t drag along and the music is amazing. It perfectly fits the mood! I do feel like the last episode was the best one, and it made me feel like the story had just begun. That\\'s another big problem. I felt like the first 6 episodes were all leading up to the real show. One good thing to come from this is that it made me want more from the show. The potential really shines through I\\'m the last episode and we get to see what the writers and directors can really do and I would have liked to see that more extreme tone through the season. I was suspecting something was going to happen but the scene really did leave me in shock. It was amazing! I want more of that in the show. My only advice for the writing team is do your research! Look at what other Netflix shows are doing and do not do that. That is the only way you\\'re getting noticed. Break the cliché\\'s! You\\'ve already started with having the protagonist having a crush on a girl. We rarely see a (possible) LGBTQ+ lead so props to you guys! Make something different and don\\'t be afraid to take risks. Overall I like the show and feel like if people give a second season a chance we may really see the ball get rolling. I am super confused as to how this is getting such great reviews. The series felt like a brief overview of a story. A cliff notes. The in between of a movie and a TV series-too short for the in-depth look you\\'d expect from a series and too long to be considered a movie. Just felt like they didn\\'t really try. Hoo boy, this show annoys me. It had so much potential but it WASTED IT! Let\\'s start at the beginningEpisodes 1-3 are very boring and repetitive and almost stopped me from finishing the show. I feel like they could\\'ve been cut down into 1 or 2 episodes and accomplish just as much. And for a show that\\'s only 7(!) episodes long, you don\\'t have time to waste repeating yourself. They\\'d just have Sydney have a bad day, have her powers blow up, and then repeat.Also for the first 4(Out of 7 episodes remember) Syd is just an absolute rude to the people who try to be nice to her (except Dina). For example, in the bowling alley scene, she makes light (and/or fun) of Stan\\'s abusive relationship with his dad (also doesn\\'t help that Stan seems a more interesting character than her)Now, I believe the show gets tremendously better from episodes 4-6. Syd gets to be more than just angry sad girl and gets to interact with Dina, Stan and her family in better ways and the story trajectory is looking very interesting.But they couldn\\'t stick the landing. And up until a point, I was loving the final episode. The characters are gelling together perfectly and the story\\'s climax is *chef\\'s kiss* Brad\\'s death is such an interesting way to take the story but the writer\\'s had to go and ruin it with the most lazy and CLICHE cliffhanger!I would\\'ve been perfectly fine if the show had just ended right there with Brad\\'s death. However the writer\\'s had to end it with that cheesy ass line \"Let\\'s begin\\'\\' (It reminded me of S7 Game of Thrones writing it was that bad) It ends the story abruptly and leaves me so unsatisfied.Now, overall I think this show is a solid 6/10 and I will definitely tune in to season 2 but goddamn I am so annoyed right now I made an account just to review this. it\\'s from the producers of stranger things so you get those vibes but it\\'s so much better. it\\'s darker, deals with more emotions, and is written so well. please watch this I Am Not Okay With This is in similar lines of The End Of The Fucking World, but with some superpowers and twists\\nSophia Lillis was good as the lead and this story just got started with it\\'s final episodeAlthough the story could have been more strong just like the cast and the act of Sophia, I believe it might improve further it\\'s credibility and story tellingI would rate 7/10 for this twisted superpower Netflix Original Series Easy going, tailored by many cliches yet very adorable, good cast, leading character Sophia Lillis has star qualities The most enjoyable Netflix original show watched. relatable and love the film look A Typical netflix show by numbers.\\nThe lead character is always lesbian. What a suprise.\\nThe guy is always kind of a wimp. nerd, outsider that\\'s bad in bed. The rest of the guys In a standard netflix show is mostly portayed as bad jockeys or bullies. There\\'s never anyone likeable.\\nThe soundtrack is also a typical boring thing. Random Spotify a little and throw some crappy tracks togheter. And People call it great.\\nWorthless music and oldies nobody cares about.\\nAnd the mind superpower?! It\\'s Always the same. Mind powers, nosebleed from stranger things is exactly the same. Is it hard to come up with something else?\\nAvoid to all costs. This series is a pretty typical adaption of a comic book teen coming of age comedy. It doesn\\'t have a real hook and the use of the protagonist talking to herself is poorly done. The dialogue, the little that there is, has been done many times before. The angst is predictable and common. So the only thing new is the new superpowers Sydney has. Even that has been done before. There are many better adaptions done better. This one has nothing really new to offer. Immediately this is going to get compared to Carrie, and while the comparison is clearly something the show itself embraces, it is actually pretty far removed. At best you could say \"like Carrie, but with actually realistic people.\"This is where the show shines; in the realistic actions of its character, so many times there are opportunities for nonsensical reactions to heighten the horror or drama and not once are they taken, and yet it still remains compelling and interesting throughout.Overall it\\'s not a perfect score as the show leaves a lot of room to grow, and it it stopped at the first series then it will be pretty incomplete, it could also use a little more laugh out loud moments to balance out the drama, but all in all it is a brilliantly crafted show that will no doubt speak to a lot of people, without talking down to them. Expected too much but its slow and irritating. Plus, there\\'s no bit of adventure. What\\'s been exploring in the first episode is still there as an issue till halfway of the season. Sorry but this wasn\\'t cool at all. Why people are calling it Powerful no clue but it\\'s extremely powerless and is not at all gripping. You can relate few emotions but overall the show doesn\\'t get to move on the right track. The big issue with this series was it was really boring. The storyline was predictable the characters had no personality or depth besides Stanley. It felt like a bunch of decent 90s movie mashed together done REALLY poorly \"I Am Not Okay with This\" feels like it arrived super late to the 80\\'s nostalgia boom. It is ridden with clichés, easter eggs and references. It even has its own Breakfast Club inspired detention episode. Not to mention the Carrie-esque season finale. It\\'s just lame at this point. Everything in this show has been done before and way better. Truly a montage of John Hughes movies. Writing was slow and poorly done. Rip off of 80s teen films with a supernatural addition. A few episodes worth of story applied toward a full season...I hope this issue is resolved in season 2. This show, while good, is lackluster. Felt more like an introduction than a full season. If you\\'re over 20, you\\'ll have seen pretty much every trope in this tiresome mess done before, and better, many many times.Even if it\\'s your first foray into Sabrina the Teenage Psyker, there\\'s really very little here to hold the attentionTo be fair, the leads are at least in the ballpark for their acting ages, but that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re decent actors. They have little material to work with beyond cliches and gimmicks - there\\'s nothing really character driven here, and zero no chemistry between any of them.The lesbian angle is predictable, tired and tawdry. This is Kennedy, not Amber.The score is cookie cutter, but the sets, cinematography, and editing is decent enough. The people making this knew what they were doing - they just didn\\'t know why, and it\\'s clear that nobody had any fun with it. This movie LOOKS great. Seriously, great camera work, great production design, just a beautiful movie. It\\'s a crying shame the story was so poorly written and the film so poorly directed and edited that the craftsmanship of the cinematography is lost. This is an ambitious story that, sadly, the director and writer weren\\'t able to execute. There are a lot of ideas that aren\\'t fleshed out, a lot of symbolism that is robbed of deeper meaning, and overall there is a story that doesn\\'t get told. Which is a shame, because I feel like the story they WANTED to tell would have been very intriguing, but sadly they didn\\'t know how to tell it. Maybe they can revisit this in a decade or two when they\\'ve learned their craft a bit more. I\\'d pay to see that. I have so many questions about this movie, but I\\'ll narrow it down to 3 questions:\\n1. Was that a zombie??? Why???????\\n2. Gretel just yeets Hansel out of her life so she can be ~witchy~ and do ~witchy~ things???\\n3. WHY WAS GRETEL THE ONLY PERSON IN THE MOVIE WITHOUT AN ENGLISH ACCENT???Anyway, watch if you want. Wasn\\'t the worst movie I\\'ve seen, but I wasn\\'t a fan. Absolutely awful, insulting to be in the horror genre, nothing about this film was scary or horrifying. First movie i ever considered walking out on or falling asleep to. Only good thing i can say is the witch was perfectly. Movie was extremely slow paced and never picks up at all, truly dreadful and waste of money. Even the music choice was awful, robotic techno sounds like i was watching tron ....it just falls short, and kind of leaves you unsatisfied. It\\'s beautiful and dark visually, and it had so much potential to be a great movie, but ends up being something better watched at home. Well this movie has nothing to do with Hansel and Gretel really they just used the name to get publicity. Hansel seems like an afterthought in this movie without no real impact.The movie is really really boring and even though it is only 87 minutes it feels like a life time. This movie is like a dj who keeps building up and up and up but it never drops the beat never and you end up blue.Buying couple beers will provide much more entertainment for you than watching this. 90 min movie that felt like 3hrs. Only bright spot was the actress playing the old witch. She was very creepy but nothing really happens I know the story as a kid, and I went in expecting this to be scary and totally different from the story as a kid, the same as they have turned other childhood stories into horror films. This film missed a lot of opportunities to develop the story to make it a great horror film. It was very boring, confusing and not scary at all. It seem like it was a prequel to a much bigger story. I wouldn\\'t waste my money going to the theater to see this, wait until it hits DVD or a streaming app. When the most memorable part of a movie is how many times characters \\'oink\\' like pigs, it\\'s not a good thing. The movie is pretty. That\\'s about it. The story goes nowhere, the plot is unengaging, and I was left underwhelmed. The film tries too hard to be artsy, stylish, and taken serious. Unfortunately, this makes the movie feel slow and pointless. Movies should feel like rollercosters, making the audience feel something- whether it be sadness, fear, or excitement, etc. This one felt equivalent to sitting in a 3 hour long college lecture on cinematography. I\\'m not gonna say don\\'t see this movie, but I will say that if you REALLY want to see it, I recommend you wait until you can rent/stream it to save your money and potentially time if you decide to turn it off. Which is a perfect description of this film. Muh feminism mixed in with good old fashion Boredom. Was this supposed to be scary? The only scary thing is the misandry. Slow. Boring. Stupid. No payoff. At least 2 people in the theater were snoring. They were the lucky ones. The struggle was real. It was a constant fight to stay awake. Twice I succumbed to the Sandman only to wake up in the same dream. \"Gretel & Hansel\" tried to put me out again but I was determined to stay awake and torture myself.There\\'s no mystery what the premise of this movie is about. Everyone knows the age old story of \"Hansel & Gretel.\" A young brother and sister go into the woods, they find a house made of delicious treats, they eat from the house, get captured by a witch who fattens them up to eat them except they escape and kill her.The story has been retold, remixed, and redone several times both literarily and cinematically. The last cinematic version I saw was with Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton in \"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters\" (2013). That was more of a Hansel & Gretel the adult years where they hunt other witches to prevent other kids from getting eaten or worse.This version tries to go the scary route. It was dark and ominous the majority of the movie. They also wanted to give it a new age spin by making Gretel the main focus as you can probably gather by the title: \"Gretel & Hansel.\" They have followed the Hollywood trend of other movies that have taken known and established stories or franchises and remade them to have a feminine focus. Look no further than \"Star Wars,\" \"Terminator,\" \"Ghostbusters,\" \"Ocean\\'s 11,\" and others. It\\'s lazy and it\\'s a disservice. The movies are trash--not because they are feminine centric, but because writers are just rehashing something that has made goo gobs of money and gave them heroines as though that is somehow fresh, radical, or unique. It\\'s none of those. It\\'s tired, lazy, and lame. Do something new and original and maybe, just maybe, it will be good.In \"Gretel & Hansel\" Gretel was the older sister and, for the most part, caretaker of Hansel. While wandering the woods in a state of near starvation they found the witch\\'s house. The witch was a child eater, but she only wanted to eat Hansel and not Gretel. In Gretel she saw power and wanted to help her cultivate that power. Hansel, as the witch explained, was only weighing Gretel down. If she would only let him go, then she would be free. Read: if women would only discard the shackles known as men then they could realize their true potential. That same message was intimated elsewhere in the movie when Gretel called the witch \"misses\" and the witch said, \"I\\'m not married. Do you see a ball and chain on me.\"If the message wasn\\'t clear enough from the two aforementioned examples, then there were three men in the movie to make the \"male bad, female good\" message stronger. Of the three men, one was morally reprehensible, one was some sort of animal, and one was chivalrous. So, two of the three men were dangerous while one was good. If that was analogous to real life then that\\'s sad. I only hope that I\\'m of the 1/3rd that are good.Gretel finds the strength to save her brother from being eaten, but she also lets him go. The boy was all of nine years old at the oldest and yet he is a male so she had to cut him loose to be the goddess she was meant to be. It\\'s a pathetic retelling of a classic in which neither Hansel nor Gretel was the dominant character. Maybe one day Hollywood writers will be creative for a change. And maybe pigs will fly. There\\'s so much they could have done in this movie, but they just... didn\\'t. Very boring. This movie isn\\'t for everybody. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It\\'s beautifully shot and very well acted. The music by ROB is pure fire. This is an art piece for sure. If you\\'re into artsy films with heavy synth soundtracks and gorgeous witches, you\\'ll love this movie. The goth in my black heart loved every minute. 🖤 The trailer was the best part of the movie. They had the opportunity to do more with it and missed the mark. Definitely should have gone straight to DVD or Netflix. I can\\'t believe I actually paid to see this nothing movie. No action, horror or real story. I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. People were asleep in the theater and I was debating if. I only have 3 words for this movie. Boring, Confusing, and Plain In this movie it starts off with the mother of the children angry and wanting the kids out of the house. It starts off kind of how women are better than men, weird but ok I can ignore that. But through out the film the witches also want gretel to learn more because men will resent a powerful woman and end up hating her. At one point during the film Gretel gets her period for no reason at all, it\\'s such a weird symbolic movie against men and pro women that kind of isolates the audience. It would\\'ve been a .ore interesting film had they left that narrative out.Apparently witches have feminist values This movie was somewhat disappointing. I did, however, liked the cinematography in this film. The acting was great as well. The problem with the movie is that, it didnt have much going for this movie. I did not connect with the characters in this film and it seemed very plain as far as the story went. I wont spoil anything here but it felt like this could have been much more in my opinion. But, i guess i shouldnt of expected too much from a horror movie in January. I find myself becoming very disillusioned with Hollywood\\'s trend of marketing films as horror films, regardless of whether or not they actually hit the mark as horror.The plot was underdeveloped yet had so much potential. I\\'ve seen the actress who plays Gretel in other films before (It, It Chapter 2, Sharp Objects) and she\\'s always impressed. However in this film, I feel she wasn\\'t given material that could\\'ve been transformed into something more engaging and interesting. The film seemed to want to be artistic, edgy, mysterious, however it failed to really allow for the characters to develop in any real or measurable way.There are so many unanswered questions but they don\\'t make the film mysterious as much as it makes the film seem unfinished and showcase the lack of effort put into the script.Why did the mother lose her mind and throw out her children?\\nWhy was Gretel fine with sending her brother back home alone to this clearly unstable woman and stay at the witch\\'s house?Just another very disappointing film. This movie falls into the niche category of horror movies that throw everything out the window (plot, dialogue, acting...) in an effort to be artistic and cerebral. Undoubtedly the cinematography is beautiful, but that\\'s the only positive. The plot is thin, the acting is okay but theres nothing there, and the overall movie was a bit boring. A definite creep factor, but not scary at all, which was a real let down. If I could put zero out of ten. I would. I does not deserve a review. Boring movie, totally different from the original story. Do not waste your money in this disaster of a movie. I took a nap! We decided to go see Grettel and Hansel after reading a review that it was the \"scariest of 2020\" whoever wrote that review needs to be schooled in what a horror movie entails. This movie had no plot, eluded to certain gory aspects but, never showed them. I found myself falling asleep waiting for it to be over! Don\\'t waste your money or your time on this one, I wouldn\\'t even waste a redbox rental. Just a typical January movie, but this one is just sooooo boring. It just fails to gain your attention, you\\'re just waiting for something to happen but it does not. First time i almost walked out of the theater but i didn\\'t just so i can tell that the whole movie sucked. The film starten good for me: An intriguing background story of a twisted evil child. The techno music (which some find inappropriate for a film like this) gave the beginning of the film a eerie atmosphere. As time went on, I found that this scary atmosphere was abandoned for an incoherent story that itself did not know where it wanted to go. Nevertheless, I thought the film was definitely worth seeing, thanks to the eerie begin and the horrific performance of the witch. Gretel and Hansel is a film that the mainstream horror fan will not completely reject but that will not be able to appeal to them. Maybe we missed something, me and my friend walked out rather disappointed after watching this movie. No clue, no suspense, no horror and well there was absolutely nothing fun about this movie. Such a waste of money. IT truly is the scariest movie of all time... If you\\'re 10 years old or younger, maybe.I honestly am shocked by all the positive reviews and high rotten tomatoes score. Did I see a completely different movie? IT starts off very well with a genuinely good opening scene. Great cinematography, atmosphere, lighting, a likable child whom you connect with easily, and an interesting encounter takes place between this kid and a very creepy clown. The dialogue is good, there is an eerie sense of dread, and a moment where IT aka Pennywise goes from being a friendly-ish clown to a terrifying villain in an instant through a very well placed awkward stare. It was a moment I wasn\\'t expecting and gave me hope for the rest of the film, then... It\\'s all downhill from there, after an almost laughable use of CG. This movie has big issues. IT isn\\'t scary. IT\\'s story is weak, if you can even call it a story. IT has too many underdeveloped characters. And IT is a counterproductive villain with no concrete rules for what IT can or can not do.The overuse of CG ruined any sense of tension or fear and Pennywise\\'s tactics didn\\'t make sense. If he feeds off fear, why reveal himself to each of the kids within a close time period? Why not concentrate on each child individually, causing far more mental torment and making them an easier kill? Pennywise also just randomly manifests himself anywhere at anytime, and disappears randomly. I don\\'t find it scary when the antagonist manifests itself, attacks a character and right before doing damage IT vanishes..The story is a mess and there are far too many characters. I swear the first 40 minutes is the longest montage in film history. A montage of each child\\'s development and exposure to Pennywise. It was predictable and monotonous. As for the story, I don\\'t know what to say, besides there really isn\\'t one. Character motivations are weak, Bill is the only one who makes sense. Where were the parents at? Not a single parent seemed to care about their missing children. The few on screen parents there were, came off as caricatures. And there were a few scenes that felt completely pointless within context of the story. The school bully and his dad, being the oddest.So in closing, IT is an uneven movie or more accurately a collection of scenes that don\\'t flow well in a tangible story. There are some good laughs, and a few entertaining scenes. But all in all it\\'s just an average movie. Which should\\'ve been an evident sign, when the original attached director Cary Fukunaga jumped ship. The opening scene is good. From there on...not as much.I guess this movie will please those not familiar with the book much more than those who are. That being said, I don\\'t think it is possible to make a satisfying adaption of \"It\" without doing it the Game of Thrones way. More time is needed to dwell on each of the novel\\'s parts to create the feel the book gave us. To tell the story as it was told on paper. So I guess I\\'ll forgive the filmmakers for that.The kids are okay. They\\'ve managed to portray the losers and the relationship between them decently enough- considering the running time. Again: more time is needed for better development. Much of what actually happened between the kids and It has been cut, but again - running time. They had to.That they\\'ve changed the setting from the 1958 to the 80s was a bad choice, and so are the other changes. They\\'re creating scenes that aren\\'t in the book. They\\'re changing things that are there. The biggest problem I have with the film is the execution of the horror. Constant jump scares, way too much CGI, and a complete lack of understanding of the fact that less is more. Waiting for a scare is the scary part of horror, and this movie just throws everything at you constantly. It just isn\\'t terrifying. At all.I didn\\'t find myself bored, though. Besides the poor performance when it came to being scary, it is an okay movie. It just isn\\'t a good adaptation. I think the film was good, but didn\\'t really live up to expectations. I didn\\'t find it that scary. Admittedly, one of the jump scares worked on me but otherwise I never felt any dread looming in the pit of my stomach. The film is gorier than the mini series. That\\'s for sure. And I liked that updated aspect, but nothing particularly shocked me. There was quite a bit of special effects that just were not very good. And I think that\\'s a big reason why I just wasn\\'t very scared.The other dumb thing I want to mention is that sometimes the characters fell into predictable horror movie tropes. Its just kind of silly when they\\'ve already been scared by Pennywise many times. Knows this all \"isn\\'t real\" and yet will wander off by one of the missing kids going \"Come here\". I mean, really? You\\'re going to fall for that? I think what does save this film are the performances. Bill does a good job with Pennywise. However, he does lack the charm that Tim Curry had. But those were always going to be big shoes to fill. (Clown pun not intended). The kids though were amazing. In particular Jaeden Lieberher (who played Bill) and Sophia Lillis (who played Bev) were the standouts. I also want to give a shoutout to Nicholas Hamilton (who played Henry) for managing to make me feel empathy for a bully. Finn Wolfhard (from Stranger Things) plays Richie who is meant to be the jokester of the group. And Finn does well with that character. I just wish the writers had laid off from the jokes some of the times. You\\'re supposed to be building tension and it kind of gets ruined when he opens his mouth to make a joke about period blood or whatever.I see the potential in this film. And I think it could have been really good. I just think they spent too much focus on \"shock value\" rather than building on an atmosphere. I don\\'t even know what to say. There was so much wasted potential here. I will say that the cinematography, the location, and the children (The Losers Club) hold up really well for this film. Yet, I\\'m still sitting here after seeing this premiere and I\\'m still shaking my head. Here is the one thing for me, that ruined the movie. If you don\\'t want any spoilers I suggest you stop reading. Here goes..What is going on with all the CGI in this film? Computer animated graphics have never scared me and this movie is littered with seemingly terrible and unimpressive visual effects. I had a feeling this was going to happen after watching the directors previous film \"Mama\" Anytime something was seemingly scary, or anytime I thought \"Hey, this movie might redeem itself\" it was almost instantaneously followed by some cheap jump scare with a villain who was computer animated to look scary. The human eye is easy to detect how fake CGI can be and folks, let me tell you, this movie relies INCREDIBLY HEAVILY on computer animated effects. No incredible monster movie effects from the 80s here. The sad part about it is that the movie takes place in the 80s (instead of the 50s like the book). What better way to write a beautiful love letter to the time period than to get some natural, realistic, and horrifying movie effects? The 70s had The Exorcist. Top notch REAL effects. Do you remember The Thing from the 1980s? ThHOSE PRACTICAL EFFECTS STILL HOLD UP TO THIS DAY. Its truly sad to see computer programs taking the forefront to create scares. Anyway, I\\'m rambling...For all of you fans of the book out there.. Spoiler alert again..You WILL be disappointed. It only uses the book as a small guideline for the story they decided to craft here. There is no Ritual of Chud. There is no Mummy, Werewolf, or drowned children in the Standpipe. Everything is rushed. This film is just a complete mess and it pains me to say so. If you haven\\'t read the book, maybe you\\'ll have a decent time if you can handle CGI. I for one thought IT was extremely disappointing, confusing, and ultimately boring and cliché. God, I wish this could have gone a different way.If you are truly interested in seeing IT... Please...please.... Save your money and go see something else. Or at the very least, wait to rent it. What persuaded me to watch this movie was the blessing bestowed upon it by the stories original creator, Stephen King, who claimed: \"I wasn\\'t prepared for how good it really was\".He\\'s not wrong.\"IT\" is quite extraordinary. The attention to detail, the subtle but effective comedic undertone and the exquisite cinematography not only do the original title proud, they make this re-imagining of the original classic even better than its predecessor. It\\'s a very scary film but what impressed me was how true the film sticks to the original\\'s tricks; it isn\\'t filled with loud in-your-face jump scares, in fact, a lot of what makes this film scary is the slick cinematography and intricate shadow play. The use of lighting and creation of atmosphere is what makes this film so tense, which is why it\\'s perfectly suited for those who like Horror movies but without the obnoxious gore.Watched the pre-release as a critic - August 28th. I already had low expectations of this movie because of the immense CGI in the trailers. I felt super conflicted with this movie because the acting was amazing by the entire cast, however there was way too much \\'comic relief\\'. This is a horror movie. I wanted to feel terrified because I was stuck in terror just about the whole movie. I should have left the theater sore because of being too tense. This did not happen at all. There was only one scene in the entire movie that felt like this and it was the bathroom scene with Beverly. That was literally it (no pun intended). The clown was so cliché when it comes to cheap horror movie antics of the 2,000\\'s. It has the retractable teeth like every new zombie movie since the Umbrella Corporation and It moves all jumpy like every ghost movie that has been out since The Ring. Absolutely NOTHING scary about the clown. If Tim Curry weren\\'t in a wheel chair I would have rather had him come back and take the place of Penny Wise without ANY CGI. All of the CGI made this movie pure CRAP. The script writing was ridiculous and felt like it had been pushed through the works entirely too fast. Each kids fear was super cheesy and AGAIN, nothing but CGI on the tackiest scale they could have ever done. It felt like this movie had SO much potential but it was all thrown away because they were too afraid to make it \\'actually scary\\'. Those of you who are REAL horror movie fans, you WILL be disappointed. This should have been a \\'straight to Netflix\\' movie as far as I\\'m concerned and I wish I could have gotten at least 1/2 of my money back It has become ritual for me to read the novel \"It\" once a year every year since it was released in 1986. The story is more than a gore-fest, it\\'s a story about love and hope and friendship that is still meaningful to me to this day.The only thing this movie has in common with the beloved book, is its name and the characters names. IT is a literal disaster and a slap in the face to anyone who actually read and cherishes the book. There are NO character backstories, nor character development at all. You are literally thrust into the movie expecting to know everything about everyone and why they are the way they are. IE: Henry Bowers and why he hates the \"Losers Club\" - He LITERALLY starts the movie trying to kill them. This is sad, because a large portion of the novel was meticulously spent doing quite the opposite and made you relate to and fall in love with the characters.Editing? What editing? This is the worst edited movie I\\'ve ever seen in my life and I\\'ve seen a lot in 41 years. It was literally like the film makers shot 100 scenes, put the film in a hat, and took out said scenes and spliced them together at total random. I can\\'t describe it any other way than saying, at one point, one of the characters (I can\\'t tell who, because they all share the EXACT same personality) says, \"I banged your mom last night\", or something similar, and before the audience can even react, the scene changes to a jump scare happening in ANOTHER PART OF TOWN INSTANTLY and with no rhyme or reason. You don\\'t have time to laugh at jokes, because they aren\\'t funny (unlike Stephen King\\'s jokes in the book) - and you don\\'t have time to be scared, because you\\'re still trying to process the dick joke that was still being told when the scene abruptly ended.While the filming location for the town of Derry was suitable, having the movie take place in the 1980\\'s instead of the 1950\\'s JUST TO APPEASE the \"Stranger Things\" crowd was simply a terrible decision. The 1950\\'s were a totally different time, and much of the characters\\' reasoning and mannerisms that you need to make this movie work are lost to a time and cultural difference. These guys call themselves \"THE LOSERS SQUAD\" in this movie for god\\'s sake! Kids didn\\'t start calling themselves a \"squad\" until the 1980\\'s (IE \"The Monster Squad) So, you love the book like me and are still reading? Thank you! Now let me list just SOME things that we both LOVE about the book that you will NOT find anywhere in this movie: The Deadlights, The Ritual of CHUD, The Mummy and the bridge, The Loser\\'s Club Dam in the Barrens, the moving picture book (now its a slide machine), The Smokehouse, \"This is battery acid\", The Werewolf, Making the silver bullet after a game of monopoly, The stand pipe, Bower\\'s hair turning white, \"beep beep Richie\", the giant bird, the 50\\'s racism against Mike (actually Mike Hanlon himself is missing. The writers just made arguably the most important character an afterthought in this movie), character backstories, \"Hi Ho Silver-AWAY!\", Haystack... I could go on and on and on.With god awful editing, absolutely no character backstories, cheap teen jump scares, not being faithful to the book, and too much CGI usage: Simply put - if you want to know how this movie is like the book, read the first 10 pages of \"IT\", and burn the other 1077 pages because that is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortion. I\\'m a huge fan of the 1990\\'s TV film of \"It\", especially for its aesthetics and soundtrack, but it left out a lot of content from the original novel, leaving me confused when I first saw it at the age of 12. This remake, or perhaps actually a \"re-adaptation\", is certainly very timely, what with \"Stranger Things\" becoming so huge with pretentious hipsters everywhere. I\\'m still not sure it hits the \"scary\" factor very well, especially without Tim Curry\\'s tremendous acting, but it\\'s certainly creepy. It\\'s not nostalgic though, nor does it retain much of the original novel, including the 50\\'s setting, changed to the 80\\'s to obviously market itself with \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Goonies\".My problem with this new adaptation of \"It\" is that it\\'s addled with CGI and jump scares, neither of which add to its nostalgic appeal. At the risk of sounding like a film snob, if you\\'re trying to make a film set decades before this era, you don\\'t use CGI at all if you can avoid it, unless you really know how to camouflage it. The constant profanity did nothing for the story either, it only gave the false illusion of being edgy. Yes, the book had profanity, but King knew where to draw the line and keep the perfect balance of immature vulgarity and true friendship. The sheer level of nerdiness here made me cringe, unlike the TV movie which had genuine friendships and sweet moments of love and joy amidst the horror, just like King\\'s novel. Did one of those boys seriously just say \"Get me my bifocals, I hid them in my second fanny pack\"? What the hell kind of child wears bifocals? Why not just rename him Poindexter while they\\'re at it? The kids in the book and the miniseries were never this obnoxiously dorky. And what\\'s with all this New Kids on the Block stuff? There was a scene in which for no apparent reason all these close-ups of NKOTB posters pop up on-screen. Why? Just because earlier in the film a kid had been listening to that music? It made no sense! We get loads of terrible one liners from Richie comparing the blood in the sewers to \"period blood\" (lovely, eh?) and trust me, no way does any thirteen-year-old talk like this. All kids at that age swear and tell fart jokes and stuff, but even they have their limits.Mike is only added as an afterthought, which seems borderline offensive, as if they only added him as a token minority whereas in the book and film he was such a complex, central character. He had a strong bond with his father that\\'s totally absent from this film. Stan is unlikable, and the newly revamped Pennywise the Clown has teeth that could rival the most inbred hillbilly, and the most scary thing he seems to be able to do is hop around like some kind of wino. Uh yeah, real \"spooky\", I\\'m shaking in my boots. Then we have the film\\'s complete disregard for the friendship, the glue that holds the story together. Killing and gore and sex and violence and swearing is not what horror is about, it\\'s about the darker side of life, and this film only portrays it in a cheesy slasher film type of way. I\\'m not trying to sound preachy, but where\\'s the love and friendship between the characters? When it is there (which isn\\'t very often) it feels forced. In the old miniseries, it felt authentic and true, and the kids were actually portrayed as kids, not young adults. This new film is completely void of the book\\'s special qualities such as the \"hi-ho Silver!\" thing and Eddie\\'s \"battery acid\" line. The film just doesn\\'t have the stunning scenery that the miniseries had, either. The miniseries had an actual gothic revival pump house as the sewer building (the Buntzen Hydroelectric Station of British Columbia), and it was creepy and nostalgic and absolutely the perfect choice. It had nailed down the industrial small town in an economic slump kind of look perfectly, too. This film looks too clean for that, with CGI used in all the wrong places to create what looks like fake looking stage sets.This film isn\\'t completely terrible. It passes the time, but the only thing it has going for it is that the director thinks he has hit some 80\\'s vibe gold mine when in reality it just looked like a bad video game full of childish jump scares. I was hoping it might be more like the 2012 film Sinister, a genuinely frightening and timeless boogeyman that leaves a subtle unsettling presence wherever it goes, but no, it just looked cheap and lazy, an obvious cash grab that\\'s being WAY overhyped. A 7.5/10 rating, are you kidding me? Even King\\'s 1995 notoriously bad film The Mangler was better than this! It\\'s like with good marketing, this new film was able to pull the wool over everybody\\'s eyes and fool them into thinking it was a classic masterpiece. The opening scene of IT is so promising - well directed, atmospheric, and Skarsgard\\'s clown is compelling to watch. There is a brief moment where while laughing mutually with the kid, the clown suddenly goes quiet and stares menacingly. Its brilliantly unsettling. But sadly, that\\'s it as far as unsettling clown performances go - the rest of the film is typical CGI scares, and the clown throwing out taunts like the deriative satire of Scary Terry in Rick and Morty. The cinematography and acting is great. Its watchable in an afternoon Netflix kind of way. But there is no real gist, goal or drive to the story, it all just sort of unfolds scene after scene, goalless and drifty like the string-along nature of a Police Academy film. Its OK - but it really isn\\'t the classic that people are making out to be. Its been incredibly over-hyped. I personally found Insidious to be a far more effective supernatural chiller. I managed to win a preview screening to \\'IT\\' on the 30th of August, in Sydney. I had high expectations for this film - and IT exceeded them. The acting. Great performances all round. The kids had great chemistry, and you really believe that they were all great friends. It reminded me of Stand By Me and The Goonies. Out of the child actors, Richie (played by Finn Wolfhard) was my favourite and his jokes cracked the whole cinema up. Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is scary and really creeped me out, but for me there was just something missing about his character and I think he wasn\\'t given enough dialogue.A minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed, in terms with the development of Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs), but for an adaption from a book, they managed to condense the original material very well.Overall, it (no pun intended) was a great thriller film that kept me on the edge of my seat, with strong performances. Dare I say it, the cheesy 1990 mini-series is far superior. Despite the hype, this adaptation was a real letdown. The kids were great, however the the CGI was awful and the jump scares were cheap.Bill Skarsgard? Hard to tell between him and the CGI.This adaptation was lacking in both exposition and soul. All we have here is a CGI clown terrorising some kids. There is no depth to the story of his origins. There is no proper backstory regarding the kids.There is absolutely none of the feeling of dread that both the book and the original mini-series encapsulated. No atmosphere whatsoever.Its not a bad film, but highly lacking. There just isn\\'t the heart that was there in the mini series. In my opinion. The actors were fine, but the story wasn\\'t there. I believe there is to be a next installment covering the (now) grown ups. I\\'ll probably watch it - if I\\'ve nothing better to do. It\\'s simply not Steven King\\'s \"IT\\'. ALso,they appear to have recycled the CGI lady from \\' Mama\\' at one point : can\\'t find it now, but look out for it. \"Beep,beep, Richie\" appears once, so far as I can tell - a long way into the film. Against all odds, I looked forward to this. But it\\'s another turkey. Steven King tells great stories - why do the Hollywood mob insist on killing them? I truly think this was dreadful and not a patch on the original. I hope to goodness they don\\'t remake The Stand.\\' What is this? Horror for kids? This movie convinces me that the world has gone mad. This is entertainment for what age groups exactly? If its for adults, why is there so much childish humour and dialogue appealing to the sensibilities of an age group that should not be watching this level of blood, guts and graphic murder? The story line is directed towards a certain mentality, which is not of appeal to adults, at least not mature adults. Why on earth is this so popular? It failed to scare me on so many levels that I found myself imagining better scenes. How is it acceptable that kids of 12 years old were in the audience, looking at images of even younger children in the movie having their arm torn from their body, a man with a knife right in his throat? What the hell?! As soon as it was revealed that all the horrors were their imaginations, it was a pointless exercise. What happened to all the kids that were floating down at the end? Where was the main characters brother at the end? Wait for the next episode? No thanks. I would have enjoyed a psychological horror, but gore is not what I was expecting. Shows a lack of imagination by the director that he had to resort to this level of candy coated perversity. What a shame. Wow, I honestly can\\'t believe these reviews. I made an IMDb account just to write a review. I love the original and have seen it many times. This movie was horrible! I feel insulted by the directors. It wasn\\'t scary at all. Any potential \"scary\" scene was downplayed by jokes so forcefully inserted into the script. There are multiple, major holes in the story line as well. Hole 1: the group of bullies never once said anything about their buddy missing.Hole 2: the girl is pulled down from \"floating\" and brought back to life. Doesn\\'t that mean that the hundreds of kids that come down from floating at the end come back to life too? Or do their rotting corpses fill up the sewers for 27 years? Does Georgie come back to life too?Hole 3: the girl can\\'t decide which boy she loves. She took the poem from the pudgy kids room (I have to assume because she randomly ends up with it in her bedroom) but then she thinks that Bill wrote the poem somehow. The pudgy kid kisses her, bringing her back to life (true love brings back the dead girl like Princess & the Frog or something) but she winds up with Bill. Every cheesy, horror film jump scene was witnessed in this film. The acting was good, but I can\\'t see how this is touted as a horror film. I felt like I was watching a Disney movie by the end of it. *Spoliers*Honestly I was really excited about this movie, like really excited. I watched the original IT this morning to get ready for it and have some reference. And it was absolutely terrible. Seriously, TERRIBLE. Not only did I want to walk out the second Pennywise was shown in the beginning but the rest was torture. I was with other people so I couldn\\'t walk out. Here\\'s the thing, this is the first time I\\'ve ever been so disappointed with a movie that I went out of my way to write a review about it. The clown was not scary in the slightest. The teeth were stupid. The acting was a joke. The kids made a ton of terrible and sexual jokes. It didn\\'t stick to the original movie whatsoever. They took the \"you\\'ll float too\" a little too seriously. It just plain sucked. In the original, the kids were innocent and actually dorks but this was pathetic the way the kids were talking. And why the hell did we watch them in their underwear?!? I still keep wondering how the hell this movie is rated above an 8 when it should be a disappointment for anyone who knows what a good movie is. This was so much CGI that it took away from the whole movie. I could keep going but I think I\\'ve made my point. I wouldn\\'t waste your time or money. Watch the trailer and that\\'s as good as it gets. Ugh. I\\'ll start this review by addressing that I had no expectation for the movie. I am not a fan of the horror genre as it usually lacks the thought provoking aspects I look forward to in film, but the reviews were great and I thought I\\'d give it a shot.The films antagonist is a demon-clown, who can shape-shift and move through space in an instant as demonstrated during the film. IT abducts, kills and eats children, but can only do so if they are experiencing fear. In the finale fight scene of the movie Pennywise is unable to kill and eat Beverly because she is not afraid of IT but at the start of the movie he kills Georgie after having a 5 minutes conversation with him where they laugh and mingle, Georgie even reaches towards IT to grab his boat - Would he really be so scared of IT at that point or was Beverly so not scared of an actual demon holding her up by the neck?The films plot surrounds around a bunch of disasters that the kids find out seem to happen every 27 years. this information is found out by a 13 year old kid named Ben, and he figured this out by reading some articles in a library. So this entire town of people has not been able to figure this out? And he informs the rest of the gang that in Derry there are substantially more children going missing than anywhere else in the US - If that is the case who is doing the abducting of children when Pennywise is on ITs break?All of the disasters have happened near sewage drains, that\\'s how the kids are able to figure out where IT lives, but at one point of the movie how was Pennywise able to appear in places that have no actual relation to the sewage? Pennywise appears and disappears in Bills garage and basement, Beverlys bathroom, in a building where Mikes parents died and in Stanleys dads office. If IT can appear anywhere why does he choose to murder and abduct near the drain if ITs only purpose is to feed upon the children as demonstrated in the final act of the film, he is willing to make a deal with the gang to keep Bill and let the rest of the children go as after eating Bill he would start his 27 year break again. Why would a killer demon clown not be willing to let these kids go anyways and just hunt the other kids in town to feed as these kids are obviously trying to kill him?Pennywise seems to have unfathomable power as in a scene IT is using hair from Beverlys sink to grab and pull her but in the final scene IT is having a fist fight with a bunch of children, couldn\\'t IT control some sort of object found in the sewer instead to do the same? Why is IT choosing to not use ITs full power against people who are fighting back but use such powerful methods when just trying to scare somebody?The movie is riddled with cliche\\'s about the bully having a really strict father, the plot point that the only way they can defeat the evil all-powerful shape-shifting demigod of a clown is to stick together and get over their fears! and of course the scene where the boys find Beverly levitating in mid-air while she is in a complete state of trance - a coma, and what brings her out of this is a kiss on the lips from one of the boys. before the movie ends Beverly is talking about this moment saying \"It was like being dead\" but when she comes out of her coma she without taking a breath starts quoting the poem one of the boys had sent her.The movie takes place during the three months of summer and ends with the start of September where the kids still look bruised and battered from their fight. So it\\'s safe to assume it must have been like a week since it happened. What were the kids doing the rest of the summer as they started seeing the clown as soon as school was out? Were they just having terrifying hallucinations of a killer clown and then enjoying the rest of their summer at the beach before going out and hunting it down? The times-pan of events in the movie don\\'t seem to reflect the time it actually took to accomplish them.This is the first time I have ever considered walking out of the cinema during a movie. Nothing. This was a staggeringly ham-fisted approach to either King\\'s novel or the miniseries based on it. It missed the point utterly... You will not see a group of children whose shared bond enables them to overcome a monster. You will see a load of bickering kids who seem to barely tolerate each other come together briefly to rescue the kidnapped object of their pre-teen lust. You will not see an intelligently-written story. You will see a dumbed-down, by-the-numbers screenplay, complete with the usual beats, Crisis of Faith, Catharsis, and all. You will not see belief overpowering evil. You will see a ten-minute fight scene where every kid tries to out-cool every other kid and get off a Schwarzeneggerian one-liner.This movie is garbage. I can\\'t express it more eloquently than that. I had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of IT in Brisbane. The film is absolutely brilliant. Bill Skarsgård has taken Pennywise and made the role his own. Creepy, disturbing, humorous, IT really possess the creep factor, giving audiences a new reason to fear clowns. The entire casting choices were sensational. All actors really held their own, creating a sense of comradery between the characters. Like most people, I do hold the miniseries with Tim Curry close to my heart, but after seeing this adaptation, I was beyond pleasantly surprised. So much so that upon IT being released into cinemas, I\\'ll be back in line to see it again. It really is ridiculous how this movie is being praised like crazy.  This movie is so fvcking generic. It wasn\\'t scary nor was it funny.  Just stupid.  This movie is FULL of jump scares. That\\'s literally all the movie does  in attempt to \"scare\" the audience. It\\'s the cheapest and laziest way  to \"scare\" people. Many times the kids in this movie try to be funny  but come off really stupid instead.  The scene where the two groups of kids are throwing rocks at each other  and the movie is playing some rock music is so cringy. What the Hell  was the point of that scene? Ridiculous.  And what was up with that zombie homeless looking dude? That zombie guy  talks like a death metal singer and I felt like I was watching The  Walking Dead.  I did not give a fat fvck about ANY of the kids in this movie. I was  not interested nor was I rooting for the kids. There was nothing  special about any of the kid characters. NONE of the kids of the  \"Losers Club\" gets killed in this film. All that tension and none of  the kids get killed. Not one.   Close to the end of the film, Pennywise gets his ass beat by a group of  kids with baseball bats and chains. LOL! He couldn\\'t fight them back.  Stupid movie. First I wanna say great family movie, bring the kids... So they can laugh along with you, I don\\'t want to spoil the immense amount of nothing that happens in this movie, or how you\\'ll grow bored of waiting for \"it\" to get scary, but I do want to know how much they were paying people walking into the screenings giving this movie a 10 star rating, or how large is the pr team? I laugh when I see red balloons now. Thought I was going to see a horror movie, got a comedy.. Talk about a let down. Having not seen the original movie and only tidbits of the trailer, I didn\\'t really know what to expect when walking into the cinema this evening. Someone described the movie as \\'The Goonies\\' meets \\'A Nightmare on Elm Street\\' - this turned out to be an extremely accurate description!The opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark, yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercut by comedy. This happens repeatedly throughout the film: and it works. My friends and I (as well as the entire packed cinema) found ourselves gasping at scenes of sheer terror, then only moments later laughing hysterically at the banter between the main characters.I would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart, yet I think even those individuals would find themselves enjoying \\'It\\'. If not for the horror, then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie. It\\'s as if this is a movie within a movie: a mix of a high-school-problems/coming-of-age movie and a horror. A brilliant two-for-one if you ask me!Great acting from all of the cast as well as excellent writing make this movie a must watch! I am very surprised that this film got such a high ranking. I enjoy the books, films and TV shows of Stephen King but found that this film fell way too short. The trailer looks great and Pennywise the clown looks terrifying so I was really looking forward to seeing this, but after watching this film which is over 2 hours long I could not wait for it to finish,I was waiting for it to get better but it does not - there was no scare factor whatsoever I just found it a bit boring and such a let down. I really feel this should have just gone straight to DVD - way over hyped. If you liked The Goonies, you\\'ll love this. A shockingly poor attempt at producing a horror. Terrifying, it is not. Scary, it is not. I\\'ve seen more horror at at child\\'s party. The tea-cup ride at your local fair ground will give you more of a thrill.Talk about the cliché central. A slow, plot holed, far fetched, continuity riddled farce. CGI was cheap and out of place. This is NOT a horror, or even a b-movie horror. This is more akin to a comedy at best. Of course you\\'ll get the odd \\'jump factor\\' thrown in for good measure - even these are predictable and poorly scripted. Sad to say, Scary Movie would deserve an Oscar pitted against this mess.The only saving grace was the make-up department did a great job and the acting wasn\\'t completely off.The hype surrounding this film was very well done - I congratulate the marketing and PR companies spin for a complete piece of trash. Please, please please - do not franchise this. No more!It\\'s not worthy of the big screen cinema. Save your money, wait for the DVD/Bluray release to turn up in your local penny shop. I had high hopes for this movie. In fact, you could say this was one of the most anticipated movies of my lifetime. I was psychologically tormented by Tim Curry at the age of 10, and it took several years to get over the weekly nightmares. Although aspects of the trailers made me concerned this was going to turn into a jump scare film that you stop taking seriously by the midpoint, the overwhelmingly positive reviews that were coming out after the initial screenings had me optimistic and excited to be the first one telling everyone to go see it. Unfortunately, I can\\'t do that after seeing IT.The first 10 minutes of the film were perfect. Ultimately what I was most looking forward to from IT was a new take on Pennywise. I wanted to see what a different actor could do with him, particularly his ability to be psychologically creepy and disturbing. And I felt like I got that in the first scene, and that was pretty much it. After the Georgie scene it seemed like anything Skarsgård did was masked by CGI, overblown audio, and distracting cinematography in 80-90% of his remaining screen time. What\\'s sad is I think the mainstream audience will still eat this style up. The same people who will call this Pennywise scarier than the last are the people who said the Star Wars prequels were better because they had more LIGHT SABERS in them. OK.Sure, I enjoyed the crude Richie and Eddie humor, and thought it was well-cast for the most part. But by the end I was almost yawning through the Pennywise scenes. I just got out of the film and am alone in a dark basement right now and am not scared in the slightest. There is something wrong with that. As someone who had high hopes for this movie, I can honestly say I am monumentally disappointed. In an attempt to make a more visually stimulating remake of the classic It, this movie ending up looking more like a Salvador Dali painting, if Dali were extremely tacky. The fear factor was taken out and replaced with jump scares and unnecessary gore. And I LOVE gore. Bill Skarsgard\\'s Pennywise seemed more like a mentally incapacitated pedophile than an embodiment of fear. The only salvageable parts of this movie were due to the outstanding child actors and Finn Wolfhard\\'s admittedly immature, yet hilarious wise cracks. I had hoped that because of this the relationship between the 7 friends would be properly represented, however, the introduction of certain characters and their back stories were extremely rushed or completely skipped over despite the fact that this movie was about 2.5 hours long and focused only on the childhood of the It characters. The only new thing introduced to this movie, that was actually worth watching was the scene with Bill and Georgie near the end. It might be a fun movie to watch with your friends and laugh at, but don\\'t pay money to watch it. It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve read the book or seen the first movie; so I apologize if I get some things wrong.TLDR; The film drags on in the middle by splitting up the crew and subjecting them to meaningless jump scares. This means little character interaction (which is part of what the first movie had going for it). By the time you get to the final confrontation with Pennywise, you\\'re just tired of the jump scares and want it to be over because you\\'re not really rooting for the losers. And if you are, it\\'s mostly because of what was established in the first film.Pros:\\nThe film starts off great. Somehow the scene at the bridge manages to match the iconic opening scene of the first.Skarsgård is an amazing Pennywise and is creepy as hell.Stan\\'s speech in Richie\\'s second flashback is great and actually funny.Casting is, for the most part, really good. I think it was hard for some of the adult actors to find a balance between being recognizable while still showing how they\\'ve matured over time. Adult Richie is too kid-like while Bev is too mature to the point of being unrecognizable.Cons:\\nBowers is half-assed. Literally just used for three jump scares and nothing else. Either imply that he died and leave him out or fully use him like he is in the book as the epitome of the corruption in Derry.The final form of Pennywise is unsatisfying. It\\'s literally a clown torso on some sort of arachnid body. They needed to go full arachnid alien like it is in the book. I think this part is just difficult to translate from the book though.Stan\\'s letter at the end cheapens his death. Instead of him literally being unable to handle his fear of IT, his suicide is portrayed as a sacrifice to save the others.There\\'s next to no character development and very little meaningful interaction between characters. I blame this mostly on the middle 90 minutes where they all split up. It\\'s totally different from the first film where they are actually a team.Speaking of which, this part where they all go their separate ways to find their \"tokens\" is so contrived. The story literally loses all its steam due to this and makes it feel way too long.All of the monster scenes except the ones with Pennywise have terrible CGI. They might be gross and/or startling but you can see them coming and they don\\'t contribute much.About 1/3 to 1/2 of the jokes just kinda fell flat.The constant jump scenes and long running time just make this movie exhausting to watch. It was just a constant cycle of \"pan to character, give a little backstory, jump scare, repeat\". I really, realllly wanted to like this film. As a huge fan of the original mini-series (and EVERYTHING Tim Curry), I knew I\\'d have a challenge going into both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 with an open mind. I had to separate. I didn\\'t have as high of expectations as I did for Chapter 1 as Part 2 of the mini series was much weaker than the Part 1 anyway as well as Stephen King\\'s It (Book).The actors were great. Even the first few jump scares were decent, and then it just became overkill. And not scary whatsoever. All of the CGI monsters look ridiculous and completely take you out of the moment. I grew up watching 80s/90s horror (AND LOVING IT). The baddies were REAL and TERRIFYING. For example, Mrs. Massey, the bloated bathtub corpse in The Shining. That was a real, completely horrifying image that has stayed with me 30 years after I First saw the movie. I don\\'t understand the obsession with CGI when there\\'s no need for it.Sadly, this movie was just a drawn out bore. Why they tried to add so much humor is beyond me. It ruined the entire movie.Now the guy that plays Pennywise did a great job. Except for the CGI Pennywise (that was out of his hands).When he played the character with no CGI I was blown away. I\\'m a big baby when it comes to scary movies and even I can say I wasn\\'t scared. The jump scares were alright but the CGI monsters just made the movie feel immature. Also....Pennywise is a flesh eating clown with hypnotic powers.....and they bullied him to death to defeat him. It was just such a corny scene watching pennywise shrink as they say mean things to him lmao Firstly, those people giving this a 9 and 10....what did they put in your popcorn?! Did you see a different movie?! Should you be allowed to leave reviews if your taste in movies is that bad?! Some poor sod might read your review and go see this movie...do you not feel any guilt!This was AWFUL! Its not even worth constructing proper sentences for so I\\'ll leave these points here:1. The terrible acting. It was awful. The actors were either bored or overacting (Bill, Mike, Richie). Seriously terrible.2. What on earth was the need to make this a 3 hour movie?! It was so unnecessarily dragged out and incredibly boring3. The story had no story. Mike tells them there\\'s an Indian ritual they must collect artefacts for which separates them all for 2 hours of the movie but then it turns out there was no ritual...WHAT?! What was the point of that?! Ben threw into the fire something he\\'d held dear in his wallet for 27 years for...no.....reason??4. Seperating the characters like that and filling the scenes with flashbacks made sure there was no character development5. Erm what happened to Bills wife? Bev is kissing all the guys but is still married. They turned Bev\\'s character into a gold digging floozy by having her kiss Bill then choose the wealthy and better looking Ben for his boat?!6. What in the name of all that is Mike Myers was that terrible CGI about?! The old granny scene in the original was scary as she was a creepy old lady not a 15 foot naked zombie like monster7. Speaking of zombies...Bowers zombie friend drives cars and breaks him out of an asylum? If zombies can do that, why did Pennywise need Bowers?8. Speaking of Bowers...what was the point of him in all his over acting melodrama? He did nothing. Except to prove you can be stabbed in the heart and walk away absolutely fine9. Stanley\\'s suicide notes to each and every one of them that he wrote and posted before killing himself?! The act was supposed to have been done out of pure fear...not as a human sacrifice10. The grand finale. After spending 2 hours looking for tokens and Mike carrying around a badly built dustbin made in a beginner\\'s pottery class, turns out all you had to do was hurt Pennywises feelings by calling him a clown and he will turn into a baby? I have no words....reallyPeople do yourselves a favour, avoid this at all costs Agh.. WOAH! agh.. WOAH! agh.. WOAH! agh.. WOAH!\\nThe beginning 30-40 mins was a decent setup, well shot and the dinner scene was somewhat funny. Then it all goes down hill from there. Only \"God\" knows how I wanted to love this film.As a big fan of the (masterpiece) book, I was eager for part II. I liked the first part. I didnt LOVE IT, but it was a good adaption.In the other hand, the second part is... Slow. I didnt feel the \"chemistry\" between the adult version of the Losers Club. Dont get me wrong, the acting is good, but... Something\\'s off.I didnt get the insinuations about Ritchie\\'s sexual orientation (why? And it wasnt in the book either), and the way they chose to kill Pennywise. That was SHAMEFUL. Ultra-simple solution and it made me feel dumb... SIGH.Oh! Last but not least: THE CGI FEST. I really dont like CGI in horror flicks. I dont think it is IMPOSSIBLE to use it, not at all, but God... What a CGI MONSTER FEST... I think Muschietti has a great future and a director, but there\\'s a lot to learn...IT Part II is a let down. Sadly. ...it is a disgrace because it is a gross betrayal of the original book. IT - the book - is a psychological thriller about friendship, about relationships, it is about the deep fears we have as kids and which grow with us until we are adults; it is about how we learn fighting and ultimately defeating these fears.\\nIT - the movie, this movie - is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and CGI with the sole purpose of jump-scaring the audience. There is no narrative, no storytelling, nothing more than a random - and awfully long - sequence of third league horror vignettes.\\nShame on this movie! \"For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you. I\\'ve missed you!\"Pros:The casting director very much shines in the spotlight here. If there is a category for Best Casting Director in the Academy Award, I am all in to bet that It: Chapter Two\\'s will not just get nominated, but win very big. The casting director deserves a standing ovation for choosing the right actors for the right characters that resemble a lot with the younger-selves from the predecessor.You will feel the emotional impact of The Losers\\' Club as a whole. The fear that feeds their souls, the memories that hunt them & the hopeless feeling that manipulates their strength all leave a strong impression to wonder within & about.The various & disparate forms of IT should give a blast of excitement to the audience. This is the most entertaining part of the movie where you get to watch new other-worldly creatures lingering within the shadows or the old monsters are back to haunt them with a peek-a-boo! It is gross, weird and definitely strange.The heartwarming story of The Losers\\' Club friendship is the beautiful gem you will find in no other horror movies this year. The connection they have is so strong and palpable,An excellent set of transition techniques that jump from one place to another, giving that ominous vibe and at the same time feels like an adventure.Cons:Albeit the creatures are entertaining to watch, however it lacks the manifestation of the scary rituals that should follow. This is the main problem with the IT movies, it is not terrifying nor scary enough to make you have a nightmare. Even sometimes it is laughable due to its unprecedented nature of the creatures\\' features.The real form of IT is upsetting and disappointing. I can strongly say that the majority will love IT\\'s true form from the 1990 Television Mini-Series in comparison to the remake because that looks scarier, deadlier & more realistic.It is super slow and draggy that it doesn\\'t need to be at almost 3 hours mark. 2 hours should be the best run time for this movie like IT Chapter One. It has nothing much to talk about especially during the first hour. Reunion, get together, a few jumpscare parts. That\\'s all there is to it.The second act of the movie (halfway) feels as if you are watching 5 to 6 different short films instead. Because it has that slow-burning nature, the scenes feel disjointed from one another. It spends around 45 minutes to an hour to look at every members of The Losers\\' Club being haunted by Pennywise.Verdict: IT CHAPTER TWO is certainly fresh and enjoyable. Hopes up not, its extremely slow-going story may make the audience bore enough to put you into sleep mode. IT CHAPTER TWO walks you into a journey of the insidious Derry town albeit its lack of formidable creatures. Okay so saw the first remake of the movie, was absolutely in love. I went and saw the second one today and didn\\'t feel any where near close to what I felt for the first one. It was super long but that isn\\'t even what upset me. It was just lacking in delivery! Pennywise was hardly in the movie. He was in it but they spent so much time soul searching the past of the characters that the real present stuff went lacking. Needless to say the first remake is an all time favorite. This one, I definitely should\\'ve waited until it came out on DVD. Just being honest. The first one was way to good for this to be part 2. It didn\\'t deliver the expectation that the first one set. Well, this was a waste..\\nThis movie is just a long run of jumpscares (all the f\\'ing time), not at all scary CGI monsters and reusing of the same jokes and \"scares\". I don\\'t think the director has used a single practical effect in this picture.There is no tension or character-investing in this movie, and the director manages to make the cast (who works with What they have been giving) look terrible in their acting. It is not scary, just very, very annoying and does not live up to either the book, the mini-tv series or part 1 of the reboot from 2017 (even though it also was an CGI orgy).If you like a horror movie, where you don\\'t need a build of tension or the director sticking to a plot or giving the audience a decent payout, but just adds a lot of jumpscares for almost 3 hours - You will love this..\\nBut hey, it\\'s just my opinion.. Returning to their home-town, the now-adult group of friends finds they\\'ve been gathered to fulfill the childhood promise that the killer clown Pennywise has returned and is on the loose in the town, forcing them to put aside their past traumas to defeat the malevolent being once and for all.This was a woefully underwhelming and overblown effort. Among its many flaws is the most obvious issue in that there\\'s just no reason for the running time to last this long at all. So much of this one could\\'ve been cut down or outright removed, from the introduction of the gang one-by-one to see where their lives are like now that goes into plenty of detail that could\\'ve been accomplished easier, to the incidents in the asylum tormenting the residents inside or just the seemingly endless scenes depicting the escaped inmate under the clown\\'s influence. That these are done in conjunction with utterly boring flashbacks and storytelling that shows how they used to be as kids that just go on forever, serve no purpose to the storyline at all and just seem to focus on seemingly random incidents that just plain dull to get through. It highlights the fact that the main clown does absolutely nothing here with so little screen-time as we\\'re focusing on the kids\\' flashbacks interacting with the clown or building the romance angle instead of in modern times. The other factor to lower this one are the entirely overblown scare attempts that fall completely flat. The CGI here manages to undo so much of the attempts that the scenes of the food coming to life in the Chinese restaurant is laughably inept with the black pool looking like a deformed blob-like mess that\\'s incredibly cheesy looking and makes no sense in the storyline how that works, much less comes off like any other expected outcome from the very start. Likewise, flashbacks to show the kids interacting with Pennywise, featuring the confrontation in the apartment, the statue coming to life in the park or the appearance from the sewer grate are all laughably bad and underwhelming with how crude they are. It\\'s pretty disheartening to see so much wasted time in a film this long feature so little chances for something to happen and then showcase such underwhelming and laughably bad work when they do appear, really undermining this one and making for a troublesome effort. There are only a few select aspects that work here. Despite generally being underwhelming, the encounter with the kid in the hall-of-mirrors at the carnival stands out as a wholly enjoyable and solid enough effort that works off the darkness of the setting, the overall creepiness of the concept in general and stellar practical effects that are usually missing from these other scenes. As well, the spirit of unity and brotherhood that they display in the finale when they band together to take on the true form of the creature in the underground sewer lair of Pennywise which is not only a great idea to see play out but has some energetic albeit comically over-the-top action that at least puts some life into things. Combined with the creepiness of the main clown and the ability to kill off kids with graphic results, these are all that work for this one.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, underage smoking and continuous violence against children. I personally didn\\'t enjoy IT 2017 so I didn\\'t have much hope for part 2 but I was expecting them to at least tone down the CGI instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy CGI effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more Stephen King books are going to get remakes and it won\\'t be long before we get an all CGI Maximum Overdrive movie remake.There are more scenes with Pennywise transforming and creating twisted ways to mess with the returning losers club members but sadly they are all done with CGI and are all standard copy and paste scenes from the original mini series and when the movie finally gets to it\\'s climax the makers of this \"Horror Movie\" think by simply making Pennywise bigger it instills more fear into the audience when really all it does is scream CGI and all the suspence is watered down to bigger pixels on screen than there where before \"Terrifying\"The only and I do mean only saving grace this movie has is the cast they all do a great job on screen especially considering they have to pretend to be scared and flee in terror from a green screen it\\'s not the actors fault this movie was a big let down.I recommend watching the original IT mini series if you haven\\'t already seen it Tim Curry\\'s performance as Pennywise is the reason why people who grew up in the 90s have a fear of clowns because a great actor in the right role can make all the difference in a movie Tim Curry will always be Pennywise no matter how many remakes are made just like Judy Garland will always be Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ there performance makes the movie so memorable and it can\\'t be re-created no matter how much CGI you use. After seeing Chapter One I expected so much more, unfortunately IT didn\\'t deliver. The film starts out with an overly graphic bashing scene that tries hard to be topical but instead seems to be there just to dare you to criticize it\\'s honesty. And things just go downhill from there. The Loser\\'s Club of the first film reunites 27 years later to have another go at defeating Pennywise, but where the kids were charming and you wanted to root for them, the adults all go separate ways to have their own jump scene moments through an overly long two hour middle section of the film. The film bogs because it keeps showing flashbacks to when they were kids instead of building the characters as adults. The effect is that you never really care about them as adults, they\\'re just an excuse to show CGI monsters that never really scare you on any level. The pacing of the film is so roughshod that it never lets any suspense build as it jumps from one scene to the next, while you keep checking your watch wondering how much more of this you\\'ll have to endure. The middle becomes a bit of a horror film mish mash with an homage to John Carpenter\\'s The Thing (verbatim quote and all) a little bit of Toy Story erector spider, a dash of Poltergeist\\'s Native American mumbo jumbo added in with a couple of million years old space entity tossed in in case you needed something to understand what they\\'re up against. James McAvoy\\'s character is jokingly referred to as an author whose book endings suck (a nod to the book) and unfortunately this film doesn\\'t improve on the novel. It\\'s just an overly long series of vignettes that tie to Chapter One in an unsatisfying way. \\'IT chapter 2\\' is a film based on the Steven King\\'s novels, that was released on screen in order to express the horror that the evil clown exposed in the old town of Derry. The direction is poor, seems like they didn\\'t even try to make it scary or post the image that this story was supposed to show. I remember a scene in the theater where I would laugh to those small babyheaded spiders. The cast looked like they were bored every minute of it, being there just for the title of the film and the publicity it had gained. They did not make any try to act, just reading words and acting accordingly like anybody could do it. The story had some interest but it was all sunk with the terrible acting and directing and at some point took the downroad for good as it seemed like they made it something up to fill it up as they were running out of time. There were many points during the film where I was annoyed, even bored, ready to sleep on my chair, the duration of the film was inexcusable like there were added extra nonsense minutes to it. To sum it up, \\'IT chapter 2\\' is a movie for young kids aged 10 - 14 because they would be the only ones to appreciate it. I would not recommend it for anyone over that age plus I would not pay to watch it again. It was a really bad try, I would add, pathetic at least. Rating 5.6/10\\nI honestly can\\'t believe these reviews. This movie truly disappointed me. To director Andy Muschietti you should put more scenes about the clown, because i seen the scenes is just little bit. That is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortain. This is not horror film. Terrifying, it is not. Scary it is not. There is nothing scary about this movie. There was so much wasted potential here. Consequently i found the movie too long and lost me some part of it. It just doesn\\'t feel like anything great or memorable. Good bye clown and good bye Eddie. Everything special from chapter one an both of the originals completely removed for cheap not scary cgi effects, lost it\\'s way for the all mighty Hollywood blockbuster dollar I couldn\\'t wait for it to end.CGI was horrible at times.Wait for it to come out on video. At least you can pause it and take a break. Very early on in \\'It Chapter Two\\' there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book, but messing up the ending. Anyone who is familiar with the \\'It\\' book or original mini-series will know the ending was not well liked. Here now though they had a chance to rectify things, and I can assure you they did. Not just in terms of the ending, but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one.The film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours. The thing is though I can\\'t see it having the same impact if it were much shorter. There was a lot of layers to fit in. This isn\\'t your average \"fast-food\" horror like the \\'Conjuring\\' universe films. This is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror. The first half of the film especially. A long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters, showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again. Then in the second half of the film (and yes I\\'m talking about almost an entire 90 minutes) the film kicks into hyper-drive with non-stop, in your face horror - and it is a sight to behold.The cast were again all perfectly selected. Bill Hader in particular steals the show. He is given some great one-liners to work with, much the same as Finn Wolfhard was, and he nails every one of them. There is also a great Stephen King cameo. This isn\\'t just a case of blink and you\\'ll miss him, he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue. I wasn\\'t sure whether \\'It Chapter Two\\' would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves, but it certainly did. I had a great time with this movie and I think any lover of the genre will as well. The first IT movie scared the bejeepers out of me. I mean what is scarier than a psychotic clown? Unfortunately in Chapter 2 unless you have Arachnophobia this movie will do nothing for you in terms of thrills. I feel that one of the reasons the first movie was so good is because of Skarsgaard\\'s amazing acting as Pennywise. This movie is just CG heavy and very little acting.**Spoiler**\\nAlso on an unrelated note the homophobic hate crime at the beginning did absolutely nothing to add to the film and left my thinking \"why was that necessary?\" IT chapter 2 isn\\'t a very good movie, but itisn\\'t terrible either. I am a big fan of both the book and the mini-series, so I may have gone in a bit biased. But where I really liked chapter 1, I just didn\\'t feel it for chapter 2.The acting is great, but somehow I wasn\\'t invested in any of the characters. They were just that: characters.I was pleasantly surprised the movie opened with the Adrian Melon scene. This scene is one that makes the story of IT (and many other stories of mr. King) so great: besides the obvious evil of Pennywise, there are also \"real\" threats, like homophobic villagers.I was very disappointed in the fact the storyline of Beverly\\'s husband was completely cut, and the storyline of Henry Bowers was butchered. The fact that the Losers weren\\'t only fighting Pennywise, but also had to dodge attacks from real people (so more rational fears if you will) was what made the book and the mini-series better than this flick.All in all, it was an \"okay\" movie. Not great, not terrible, just \"meh\". Well, what can I say. I didn\\'t expect too much,it\\'s difficult to transform a Stephen King book into a good Movie. But it\\'s possible (the Shawshank redemption, Dolores Claiborne, stand by me....)but there is more bad than good. This is one of the bad ones. Lots of jumpscares, all so predictable, I was so bored, I thought: oh please, not another one. And why do they always feel the need to change the plot? For instance the one about Bill not being really sick? Why do filmmakers think they know it better than Stephen King? Or steal from other movies (the Thing) And the end, the end, that was the last straw for me. If you read the book you know what IT really looks like. I was sooo hoping for a fantastic monster (they used enough CGI, didn\\'t they) maybe a little like the Queen in Alien?(the one in the miniseries made me laugh). But no, what a mess. Make the clown small? Really!?\\nStay at home and spend the money on the book. I was very excited to see this film, have been since 2017, when I saw the first one. Unfortunately, this one was a huge mess.I love the way the first IT didn\\'t want to be JUST a horror movie, but rather took time to build up a story, emotional connection. That is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays. HOWEVER, this was completely thrown out the window in the second one. Considering how incredibly long this movie is, 90% of it was just buildup for jumpscares, jumpscares themselves and weird CGI.The worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on, jumping all over the place. And most of it was just for shock value, nothing important to the story.What I did love was the casting, it was absolutely brilliant, especially Eddie.I guess this is once again a classic case of - bigger budget does not mean better movie, as well as more CGI does not mean better movie. Look, I don\\'t mind being entertained at the movies, but there does come the expectation with such an adaptation of one of the best and most beloved horror novels ever written that it accord some respect while remaining true to the source material.My main problem with this film lies in its tonal inconsistency. I could never tell if it was attempting to set a somber, foreboding, menacing feeling, or if it was trying to create an atmosphere conducive towards a lighthearted, hilarious jump-scare filled marathon. In one moment it hangs heavy in emotional gravitas (the opening scene is especially brutal and difficult to watch, and Stanley\\'s suicide is also fairly dark), and the next, it\\'s so ludicrously over the top and in your face in its execution of its \"horror\" elements that it produces a jarring sense of tonal discord. What exactly is this film attempting to be? The horror was so absurdly explicitly comedic in its execution (not helped by questionable effects work) that I must assume that was the intent. Yet in taking such a directorial approach, it effectively nullified the entire foundation that the movie required to establish and help foment the dreadful tension, atmosphere, and tone necessitated by the narrative (and of which made the book so stellar), and further relegated all the work by the actors and all other aspects of the film that had helped establish it up to that point void. If it wasn\\'t intentional, then it does nothing so well as to exemplify how the filmmakers hold a fundamental misunderstanding of what actual horror really entails.\"IT Chapter Two\" spends much of its runtime plodding through a mindless, rote, predictable checklist of the characters recovering their artifacts from their youths, to the same tired, mindless, rote, predictable jump scares thrown at you one after the other which you can see coming from a million miles off which further robbed them of all their potency. How am I supposed to care at all about the protagonists\\' emotional plights (which are portrayed in a serious light) when their antagonist and its supposedly evil forms who are responsible for them are utterly stripped of their malevolence and are portrayed in such a formulaic, repetitive, explicit, and laughably juvenile manner? Yes, I know \"IT\" manifests itself also as a Pennywise who does utilize a childlike humor to lure his prey in, but that doesn\\'t mean it wasn\\'t the only way nor that the entity wasn\\'t terrifying in all the revelations of its truest forms. They were terrifying in the novel, and here they\\'re a downright riot. A little subtlety, suggestion, imagination, minimalism and unpredictability goes a long way and would\\'ve done this film wonders, as that\\'s where the real core of any effective horror resides. It would\\'ve not only have helped maintain tonal consistency, it would\\'ve made it genuinely unsettling. My theatre was howling at every turn, and I\\'m completely left at a loss as to whether that was what the director intended.As is, this film suffers an identity crisis. It is inconsistent, predictable, ludicrously (and unintentionally?) hilarious, redundant, overly drawn out to the point of boredom, and worst of all, a downright insult to King, who I\\'m shocked made the cameo he did in tacit approval of this screen adaptation abomination of his finest work. The glaring tonal juxtaposition and abysmal execution robbed me of all interest in witnessing The Losers\\' Club finally confront this ultimate evil terrorizing a small Maine town every 27 years, because in the end, it wasn\\'t an ultimate evil at all......it was a goddamn mockery of one.And due to that, I walked out. Truly, truly awful. In 1913, Henry Ford introduced the assembly line to the Ford Motor Company. He made a ton of money and was hailed as a leading innovator. Now just a hundred years later, director Andy Musciehtti brings that same assembly line principle to It Chapter Two as he serves up his scary products in the exact fashion as the one before.This sequel to the highest-grossing horror movie of all time (unadjusted) takes place 27 years later in the same town of Derry, Maine. The rambunctious kids are all adults now and have gone on their separate paths to some form of success. Unfortunately, the good fortune for each is put to an end by the return of Pennywise, who seeks more victims for his twisted games. Being the only ones that have stopped the evil force, the adults must come together again to put an end to this bloody mess.Director Andy Muschietti returns behind the camera after the record-breaking success he earned from 2017\\'s \"It\". For the second time around, Muschietti goes even bigger and bolder than before, both in terms of the horror set pieces and the length.When it comes to giving audiences what they came to see, Muschietti delivers on adding even more blood, gore, and creepiness. Pennywise\\'s indescribable powers get even more creative as his prey are stalked and slaughtered with unnerving brutality.The biggest fault that plagued the previous film was its recycling of cheap jump scares that were meant to artificially hold your attention. That same problem is even more glaring in the sequel as any scary moments are just startling moments where something pops out at the screen. The more they happen, the more predictable and boring they are to watch.A runtime is never indicative of quality by itself, every movie should earn its length through skill and craftsmanship. And at 170 minutes, \"It Chapter Two\" falls way short of earning its record-breaking runtime. Instead of the horror being a slow burn, it\\'s more of a slow churn as the recycled jump scares quickly lose their minuscule luster and make this already long film feel even longer.Screenwriter Gary Dauberman takes up the impossible task of adapting Stephen King, a challenge that has killed the careers of countless adapters before him.Dauberman tries his best to break away from the ridiculousness within King\\'s novel, but his efforts end up backfiring on him and make the film even more awkward as some elements are left in and some left out. The story wants you to take it pretty seriously, but keeping in the weird elements make that almost an impossible task.Muschietti didn\\'t do much to justify the excessive length, but Dauberman should shoulder more of the blame with his uneven pacing. The film starts great with the together and playing off each other with a fun and brisk pace. Then, against all logic, Dauberman has them split up for ninety minutes, severely slowing things to a crawl and forcing the jump scares to keep you awake.The highest regards should go to casting director Rich Delia as he has brilliantly put together a group of adult actors that uncannily look like their younger counterparts. Unfortunately, good looks are the only quality some actors possess here.James McAvoy does fine as Bill. The most evident acting trait he shows off is his struggle to hide his Scottish accent with a less than convincing New England one.Having a rocky 2019, to say the least, Jessica Chastain follows up the bomb that was \"Dark Phoenix\" with another subpar performance. She doesn\\'t shine as brightly as Sophia Lillis\\' younger Beverly despite being the more acclaimed actress with a lot more screen time.The standout performances come from the two Bills in the cast, Hader and Skarsgård. Hader plays adult Richie and fairs the best in the cast at toeing the line between drama and comedy.Skarsgård as Pennywise is a sight to see but unfortunately doesn\\'t get seen for long stretches. Between him and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker, future performances for clowns now have an insanely high bar to reach.With over five hours of material between two films, the \"It\" series has come to a less than satisfying close with \"It Chapter Two\". There are some things to admire Muschietti and co. for doing or trying to do. But for every great Bill Skarsgård moment (which is all of them), there were just as many moments of wasted potential due to unoriginal filmmaking. Overall, between its highs and lows, \"It Chapter Two\" makes for a semi-enjoyable time. Just make sure to bring a seat cushion. Camille, who was drunk almost every hour of the day from the moment she arrived in town, tries to repress the traumas she has experienced but she is not very successful in that regard. We understand with instant flashback scenes how emotions that Camille suppressed suddenly surfaced and she can\\'t cope with her past. The town\\'s suc-cessful drowning atmosphere, combined with masterful work of fiction and image management and with the convincing performance of Amy Adams, turns the series into a complete mood, so to speak. With the hypnotizing music that plays in the background while watching to the series we seem to be drunk in the Wind Gap with Camille. There are great soundtracks from Led Zeppelin to The Doors, from Bob Dylan to Johnny Cash.The scene transitions between past memories and the present are very successful. It\\'s like the scenes are intertwined. You\\'re not leaving the general story of the series as you watch the past memories scenes. It\\'s very well tuned. We see that the series doesn\\'t go on a straight timeline. The scene at the beginning of the episodes is actually the final scene. Although not in each episode, some episodes have these time shifts.In the background of the series, the words shown for 3-4 seconds may give hints about the series. At least when you watch it carefully, it makes you think. Who knows, maybe a subliminal message. You\\'re unlikely to guess who the killer is. Because in each section you focus on different people. Ideas may change as new details emerge. So it\\'s a little hard to guess. Something I like about this series. Because an unpredictable series is more attractive to me.I found the acting very good. I think Amy Adams deserves the Golden Globe award with this performance. She conveys her character\\'s mood very well to the audience. You feel deeply the feelings of Camille. Amy Adams and Patricia Clarkson are really good. I found the tension between them very good. Unfortunately, it is not possible to escape from the parents we are attached to. Camille also lives this situation deeply. I guess one of the most complicated things in life is the child-parent relationship. Eliza Scanlen who plays the character Amma is very successful. Like two separate characters in the morning and night. It\\'s like there\\'s someone else in Amma when it\\'s night. Of course it is necessary to open a separate parentheses to Sophia Lillis. She performed very well.Although the first episode starts with a slow pace, the next episodes are moving well. And it reflects thriller very well. The entire town, including the police, seems to be looking for the killer from a single perspective. It\\'s like the killer is the whole town. I love watching horror movies but I can\\'t say I\\'m scared most of the time. But in this series, there were a lot of scenes that creeped and disturbed me.In the series the mystery of the killer is preserved until the last moment, but in the final, the series shoots the audience in the heart with a single sentences. The series manages to leave a shocking effect on viewers with its final. Sharp Objects gave the message that it wanted to give in eight episodes. I can recommend it for those who love the psychological thriller and killer themed. 9/10 Absolutely brilliant. If your looking for a happy story, look somewhere else. Very dark, very depressing, if you have it in you to watch, you get a masterfully spun story of true pain, true guilt and loss. Also a very good depiction of mental health. With a final act that is JAW dropping. I\\'ve never written a review on here, but this is a masterpiece. The reviews that rate this series poorly, (or comment on how slow it is) likely thought this was going to be a murder mystery. It is about murder, but the \"who-dun-it\" is secondary. This is a character study in damaged human beings, how they got to that point, and the different ways it manifests in their lives. It is dark and unflinching in some places, and it is fascinating. It is also incredibly well acted. The \"slow burn\" pace is a dramatic marinade, allowing us to really soak in the character and absorb the experience. It makes the finale that much more impactful, and what a twisty finale it was! If you like character driven stories wrapped in a murder mystery, this will not disappoint. Is it slow? Yes, it is! But it\\'s also beautifully made. The characters are amazing, the acting is even better and the story is catchy. It\\'s a mystery-drama series...it supposed to be slow, to give you time to grow with the characters, to understand every detail. It\\'s not advertised as being the avengers...it\\'s not an action movie... Absolutely amazing mini series. There were times that I was confused by quick cuts to flashbacks and flashes of gruesome scenes and wondered if they\\'d ever make sense, but all the while I knew they would come together in the end. This was absolutely true. By the end of the series, all these loose ends were neatly tied into a present with a bow on top, and then the very last scene of the finale blew my mind. 100% would recommend watching! Haunting first episode of a show that had me and my wife entranced for the full hour. The editing, cinematography (particularly the framing), mixture of original score and Led Zep songs, casting and performances were all 10/10. It\\'s interesting that Amy Adams, the best working actress without an Oscar, might win an Emmy first if the rest of the series is any indication. I\\'ve never posted a review before but just HAD to for this. I\\'ve also never binged watched 7 hours of tv straight before. This was brilliant from the beginning to the very last credit. This series has the nerve of season 1 of True Detective, the cinematography of Inception, the clipping of the Blade Runner, the grit of The Wire and the family dysfunction of Six Feet Under. It\\'s all the good things of cinematography in one series. Great acting, suspense in every episode and a loss for it only being a miniseries. If you\\'ve seen any of Adam\\'s earlier works, this one will shock you. Her character is not charming, glowing, sweet and innocent. Her Camille is broken, confused, and in deep pain.She has to return to her home town to cover a murder for her newspaper. In doing so, she must confront her own past, which is full of abuse, neglect, addiction, murder.... Camille has never properly confronted her past. She has drowned it through work, alcohol, and sexual obsession. Adam\\'s performance is so nuanced, so perfect. She conveys with a glance what most actors cannot with a soliloquy.The production is spot-on - especially the editing. Camille\\'s past and present collide in quite breathtaking turns - moments sometimes so brief as to seem fleeting.You\\'ll want to give this multiple viewings... it will take you time to decipher the story, but you will love every minute of it. Dear Filmmakers:I\\'ve noticed a trend in television shows lately: The stories are being dragged out. I\\'ll get to the end of episode 3 or 4 and start to feel frustrated because nothing much has happened since the 1st episode. I\\'ll check the episode list and groan that a good story is being stretched across 8-10 episodes. However I\\'m hooked, I need to know what happens, so I continue to watch. But I respectfully request that they be told more concisely. My family has developed a game of sorts to each give our opinion as to how many episodes the story could have actually been told in and inevitably, it is at least half. Sharp Objects is one of these shows that could have been told in half the episodes. Easily. The acting was superb, the story interesting, but the pace was slower than a Sunday afternoon. These are good shows, i.e., Goliath (2nd season), The Sinner, The OA, Mindhunter, Lost in Space, and now Sharp Objects, just to name a few. They are worth watching, but I find them frustrating for plot points to be piecemealed out over so many hours. I\\'m not asking the stories be told like the fast-talking legal disclaimers at the end of an AM radio ad, but just be tightened up a bit.Take the first season of Stranger Things, for instance. It was like an 8 hour movie where each episode advanced the story line at a very satisfying pace. I couldn\\'t stop watching and gobbled it all up in one day. (I LOVE when all the episodes drop at once!) The first and second season of Bosch were like this as well. Bingeing at its best. Now I know this is my opinion and others will disagree with me, but it is a trend I have noticed over the past couple of years and maybe there are others out there who have noticed it too. This is my little two cents worth.I find it strange to ask for less of a good thing, but that\\'s what I\\'m asking. I want to watch shows that make me put down my laptop and phone, to make me stop playing games or surf the internet while the show is on. I wanna have to pause to discuss what just happened and look forward to watching more. Instead, my reaction to last night\\'s Sharp Objects was \"yay, it\\'s the last episode and we can finally get some answers\". The paint has finally dried!I sound ungrateful, I know. This show and the others I mentioned are good TV. I thank you for the excellent programming. I just want it to be a little less....stretched.Thank you. A hats off to Jean Marce Vallee. This is a masterpiece. I still didn\\'t get over from the finale. Especially from the post credits scenes. This is far better than the brilliant Big Little Lies by the same director, which was really good too. We can\\'t really decide who did their roles best. Amy Adams or Patricia Clarkson or Eliza Scanlen. They were absolutely stunning. A must watch for all. The love scene between John K and Camille should be the clincher for award season! Poignant, tender, and shows two humans connecting on a primal basis sharing and understanding each other\\'s painCamille writes her pain on her body then hides it from everyone but John can see thru her guards since he has the same pain. This allows them to connect in a way she never could with Detective.Powerful scene that deserves recognition! Masterful in every single frame. If you liked True Detective this might appeal to you as well. If you are looking for something to restore your faith in humanity you might want to watch something else. Although this eight-part HBO limited series has been advertised as a murder-mystery, it\\'s really a character study, with the murder plot functioning primarily as an impetus to facilitate engagement with the characters surrounding it. Nothing wrong with that, of course; the first season of True Detective (2014) (still one of the finest seasons of TV ever made) worked as well as it did not because of the ostensible whodunnit, but because of the psychological deep-dive into its two central characters. Sharp Objects is similarly interested not in who\\'s behind a pair of murders in a small Missouri town, but in how those murders affect a trio of women caught up in the investigation. Feminine in design rather than inherently feminist, the show is a portrait of tainted motherhood and corrupted sisterhood, and focuses on internecine inter-generational conflict, matrilineal dysfunction, and how difficult it can be to escape from past trauma. But whilst the acting is exceptional, and the show is well directed and edited, much like the first season of Big Little Lies (2017), it left me wholly unengaged, completely uninterested in any of the characters, and fighting interminable boredom for much of its eight hours (it\\'s yet another example of one of the worst elements of Prestige TV; series which are far, far longer than they need to be).Sharp Objects tells the story of Camille Preaker (an exceptional Amy Adams), a reporter for the St. Louis Chronicle, who is sent back to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri to report on the murder of two young girls. A barely-functioning alcoholic prone to carving words into her flesh, Camille is ill-prepared for the effect Wind Gap has on her psyche. Central amongst her demons is her mother, Adora (a spectacular Patricia Clarkson), who looks down on Camille with barely-concealed disappointment. Camille is especially haunted by the memory of her younger sister Marian, who died when they were still children, but in the years since Camille moved away, Adora re-married and had another child, Amma (Eliza Scanlen, in a breakout role), who fascinates Camille with her dual personality - dutiful daughter from another era who wears elaborate dresses and plays with a doll\\'s house, and roller-blading lollypop sucking teenage temptress.Based on the 2006 Gillian Flynn novel, Sharp Objects was written primarily by showrunner Marti Noxon and Flynn herself, with directorial duties handled by Jean-Marc Vallée, who also helmed the aforementioned first season of Big Little Lies. Vallée was also lead editor, and this is important insofar as the editing is the show\\'s calling card, as he attempts to draw us into Camille\\'s psyche via fleeting snippets of childhood memories. The editing rhythms will definitely throw some people off initially, with the frequent one second (or less) cutaways recalling Oliver Stone\\'s \"horizontal editing\". However, a more apt comparison would be the free-associative editing style of films such as Hiroshima mon amour (1959), Zerkalo (1975), and probably the best evocation of memory ever put on screen, Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988). Indeed, the technique is not entirely unlike Marcel Proust\\'s use of \"involuntary memory\" in À la recherche du temps perdu - so, for example, adult Camille lies in bed and stares at a crack on the ceiling and when we cut back to the bed, she\\'s a child looking at that same crack; adult Camille is shown opening a door, and we cut to child Camille entering a room; adult Camille hears a song and closes her eyes, and when she opens them, she\\'s a child listening to the song on the radio.This editing style inculcates us into Camille\\'s fractured mind, whilst also hinting at the nature of her trauma, without ever being too explicitly revealing. As will be discussed in a moment, Vallée grossly overuses the technique, neutering it of its potency, but that notwithstanding, it\\'s a good example of the importance of \"show, don\\'t tell\", as well as a great example of content generating form and form simultaneously giving rise to content; the memories are always tied to Camille\\'s fragmented psychology, with the brief snippets of recollection acting like splinters impinging on her adult existence.Another interesting aesthetic aspect of the show is its sense of place. Taking place during a hot summer in which the entire cast are permanently sweating, one can practically feel the humidity rising from the screen and smell the pig farm on which so many of the town\\'s people work. But it\\'s not just the sense of tangibility; at times, Wind Gap comes across as surreal enough to be the location of a David Lynch film. The introduction to the town, for example, is a series of long tracking shots which show next-to-no people, as if the place has been abandoned. Later we see Amma and two of her friends perpetually roller-blading around town like the 21st century equivalent of the Moirai, we also meet a little boy who lives with his meth-addicted mother and who carries a gun to ensure their safety.Thematically, the show covers a lot of ground, almost all of it tied to female experience, specifically motherhood/daughterhood. Adora is a woefully bad mother who made little secret of the fact that she preferred Marian to Camille; when Camille arrives at the house upon her return to Wind Gap, rather than be happy to see her, Adora icily tells her, \"I\\'m afraid the house is not up to par for visitors\". In a rare moment of openness, as Camille struggles to understand why Adora treats her the way she does, Adora tells her, \"you can\\'t get close. That\\'s your father. And it\\'s why I think I never loved you. You were born to it, that cold nature. I hope that\\'s of some comfort to you\". Later she admits that what she wanted from Camille more than anything was the one thing Camille couldn\\'t give her - she wanted Camille to need her.In a more general sense, the show deals with how women respond to familial trauma. It doesn\\'t engage with feminism at a political or cultural level, but it certainly does so at a personal level, arguing that the pain experienced by abused women is just as valid as that experienced by abused men, that the manifestations of trauma can be just as catastrophic, and that the anger engendered can be just as self-destructive. We\\'re very used to seeing stories focused on angry, damaged, hard-drinking male characters with dark backgrounds who must fight to control the violence within them, but Sharp Objects is a story focused on the female equivalent of that trope. Indeed, Wind Gap is a town where women are locked into the virtuous virgin/rampant harlot binary, a binary created by men. It\\'s a place where a woman\\'s worth correlates directly with her femininity, her maternal instincts, and her obedient acceptance of her place in androcentric societal structures - everything Camille is not.However, for all that, I couldn\\'t get into Sharp Objects, and by no means did I enjoy it. The biggest problem is the pace. Yes, I understand it\\'s a character drama, not a plot-heavy murder-mystery, but so too was the first season of True Detective and never once did I feel that show was moving too slow. With Sharp Objects, as episode after episode after episode ended flatly, eventually I just stopped caring. Aside from a major incident in the first episode, and a couple of big reveals in the penultimate and last episodes, almost nothing happens. And that\\'s not hyperbole, I mean it very literally. Tied to this is that the show is far, far too long. The novel is 254 pages, and could easily have been adapted in a four-episode run, but trying to stretch it out over eight (it runs 385 minutes) means that there are long periods were the narrative stops dead, with the characters not interesting enough to take up the slack. Elsewhere, the flashback editing is used so often that it loses its potency and ends up feeling like filler designed only to artificially prolong the runtime. It also starts to feel like Vallée is so in love with the technique that he\\'s using it arbitrarily rather than in the service of character or plot. Additionally, the show abounds in clichés - from the alcoholic hard-as-nails journalist to the incompetent local police chief to the out of town detective to whom nobody listens to the gossiping women to the various suspects who are obviously red herrings. Vallée also has a tendency to overuse certain images, thus robbing them of their effectiveness - Amma and her friends roller-blading around town, Amma playing silently with her giant dollhouse, shots of the child Camille being chased through the woods by a group of jocks, shots of Camille filling a water bottle with vodka.There\\'s a lot to admire in Sharp Objects, but precious little to like. Although not exactly a work of post-MeToo fempowerment, it certainly has a female-centric perspective, and its examination of issues usually associated with men is interesting, saying some fascinating things about female trauma. The performances are top-notch and the editing is decent (albeit overused), but all in all, the show did little for me. I understand that it\\'s designed holistically rather than cumulatively, and I have no problem with that. But the pace is enervating and the characters just aren\\'t interesting enough to fill such a lengthy runtime. I love Gillian Flynn because she writes about real women. Fully fleshed out, gritty, strong, good bad and ugly, real women. I love Amy Adams and Patricia Clarkson because they convey that beautifully. \\nI was really looking forward to the start of this miniseries because I so loved the book, and so far I am not disappointed. The cinematography and score are fantastic, and the acting is superb. It is a slow burn, as it should be, and it is in equal measure tense, taught, and hauntingly beautiful. I cannot wait to watch the rest of this story unfold. I do not read for pleasure very often, but after seeing the series I bought the book. And devoured it.Admittedly, the series feels to move slow, but at the end of every episode you are left thinking \"what the...?\" in the best possible way. And the pacing of the show just makes the ending that much sweeter and satisfying. Great cast, and phenomenal performances from everyone. Amy is incredible as usual! The best series I\\'ve seen in years! Masterpiece!!! See until the last second. Even in the final credits. Wow, never felt so many awful feelings after seeing such an amazing show. Wow It is raw and real in every sense. The script is finely performed by all the ensemble, and never insults the intelligence of the viewer. It always ends with me wanting to see more. I love everything about it. Great atmosphere and soundtrack, very similar in tone and style to Big Little Lies - also by director Jean-Marc Vallée. Amy Adams brings class and subtlety to what is not an especially original storyline (Camille, a journalist haunted by ghosts of her past returns to home town to solve murder). But excellence of execution makes this shine. Patricia Clarkson\\'s portrayal of Camille\\'s narcissistic, self-absorbed mother is equally effective: you\\'ll find yourself wanting to choke her in every episode. Also so refreshing to see women\\'s lives and stories portrayed in a non-exploitative way. Camille\\'s struggle with alcoholism and self-harm is depicted with unblinking realism and is something many women can unfortunately relate to. Looking forward to the rest of this series, which is shaping up to be as good as season 1 of True Detective. Highly recommend this. This is the type of show I want and need in my life.\\nBrilliant acting. LOVE Patricia Clark she is such a dear friend in my head. So talented and beautiful.\\nCant forget about the lovely Eliza Scanlen so skilled. This must have been such a great part to play.\\nAnd, come on AMY ADAMS I wanted to scoop you up and take care of you myself. The show proceeds with its own pace, and yet succeeds to keep us hooked. Amy Adams as Camille Preaker has displayed remarkable depiction of a girl who has battled self-injuries all her life. Her troubles feel real, which the actor portrays in a very convincing manner.What makes the show successful and a quality watch is how well and deep it is textured. Every conversation or scene, ordinary at the surface has a lot going on beneath. One begins to genuinely feel for Camille and wonder why she faces the heat of her own mother, who appears to completely despise her.The town, the townsfolk, the chitter-chatter of the women - feels like a documentary on an American town, something for the international audience to experience.And the final reveal on Adora definitely comes unexpected and as a shock. There are scenes that are just difficult to watch, events difficult to believe.The story ends and one begins to feel the makers are moving towards a patient finish, just like their show\\'s style. But then comes the final twist - something few could\\'ve ever imagined. This series addresses the emotional and psychological trauma that can happen when you\\'re dealing with an emotional over protective mother, a complacent father and multiple unsolved murders in small town Missouri.\\nIt keeps you on the edge of your seat until all is revealed and you never know what hit you.\\nAMAZING acting by all main characters and no spoilers here.\\nGreat series!!! Hard to assign this series a number of stars, some aspects 10, others 1. The acting was stellar, making the characters believable in their almost unprecedentedly dysfunctional family crucible. And kudos to the way cinematography and editing created the most vivid \\'inside\\' view of the mental tortures of PTSD that I know of on film, paralleling the way that A Beautiful Mind put us inside the mental labyrinths of paranoid schizophrenia. (For those commenters who have complained here about the erratic and incessant flashbacks, literally \"flash\" backs, and found them inexplicable, this would be my response: you were seeing a depiction of the manifestation of PTSD. Imagine how anguishing then it is for an actual PTSD sufferer plagued by all such \\'cuts\\' and slices of trauma bombarding their mental visions, unrelentingly.)But the artistry which achieved that depiction of PTSD is also a disjunct with the series ending where even more frenetic, barely visible cutting and slicing of flashes of violence -- seeming to be in the same vein as Camille\\'s PTSD that we\\'ve been immersed into, racheted up in the splicings into the final credits as if on steroids, cannot serve the same purpose (in terms of the medium being the message) and thus left me with a sour end note as to director\\'s choices. Those mid-closing- credits scenes were not illustrations of the workings of PTSD; they struck me (and my husband) instead as kind of cheap shortcut twists to stab us, the viewer with, so as to shake us up regarding what had seemed to be the series\\' final verdict on its crimes and punishments. Those cinematic/editing choices rode in on the backs of Camille\\'s PTSD depictions, so to speak, but they violated the exclusive use of those choices up to that point for illustrating PTSD. These could not plausibly (story perspective wise) be Amma\\'s PTSD, they were instead a break away into some \"omniscient narrator\" visuals. And while the series did put us into the POV of multiple characters, including Amma, that never included entering into anyone else\\'s but Camille\\'s PTSD-flashback experience/sensations.So that attempted conflating of a use of a film-editing \\'device\\' to illustrate PTSD and then in the last frames of the whole film to use that same \\'device\\' for some wholly other purpose was, for me, a sort of sabotage. And perhaps also a degree of disrespect for the story and/or the viewer to relegate such a story twist to a barely recognizable insertion mid-final-credits. Other films have deftly left us with final twists that \\'owned\\' themselves, for one thing by coming before final credits - films for example that leave us with some micro last-minute filmed focus on a detail that changes everything, such as making us know that we\\'d been watching someone\\'s dream rather than \\'reality\\' - \"Mulholland Drive\" and \"Take Shelter\" come to mind. Their endings then became controversial fare for folks like us to debate as to what their ramifications and implications were for reframing the entire film\\'s plotline, but that works. Sharp Object\\'s post-ending ending just felt shortchanged and inappropriate to the film\\'s chosen form-function schema.(It also felt a bit cheap storytelling-wise to have Adora, in her very last extended scene with Camille, segue into a bit of her own backstory to telegraph to the viewer that she came by her dysfunctions \"legitimately\" i.e., handed down by her own mother to her. I would suspect that the novel did not wait until the last minute to weave that message into the telling.)As an aside, viscerally, the hardest thing in the film for me was getting my mind around Camille\\'s cutting. Most specifically, was she supposed to have engaged, at least sometimes in \\'collaborative cutting\\' à la tattooing? How could she have \\'achieved\\' those cuttings into her back? Unlike tattooing, which is inherently social, cutting is a very isolationist dis-ease; it felt disrespectful of the viewer not to give any kind of accounting for how those backside word-cuts could have happened, thus leaving it in the realm of implausibility. The acting is best thing about this. The story is very slow and boring. Constant flashbacks with no context are hard to interpret, make no sense. The camera is constantly shaking which gets more and more noticeable as the episode progresses. At the time of writing this has an 8.8 score, which simply cannot be true. I gave it a try but I definitely will not waste any more time on this.'],\n",
       " 'LindseyM': ['First off, I enjoyed Season 1 of The 100. Season 3 was inferior compared to other seasons.The 100 is an American post-apocalyptic drama television series. I love The 100 because it has a unique story line. 97 years after a nuclear apocalypse, 100 prisoners sent down to the earth to see if it is survivable for the ark and it\\'s lacking resources. This show is another amazing and intriguing apocalyptic show that has caught my attention. I was sceptical at first as I am not a huge fan of the CW\\'s channel however I realised that this is an exception to that thought. I have so far really enjoyed watching it and am hooked. If you like The Walking Dead, Revolution or Lost then you will love this show! If you like apocalytic, intense, thrilling, quality dramas, this is your show. It has a nuclear and isolated feel to it and it has yet to disappoint me. If you like the show too, please spread the word as much as possible, the show can\\'t survive without support and good ratings so encourage those around you.There are so many cool sci fi themes and issues in the show that it really keeps you interested in watching. Characters are also very interesting and bring you in. I would highly recommend this show to any sci fi fan! You won\\'t be disappointed. 8/10 The 100 does something not many series can do, it gets better with every season, the character development is great and realistic. Honestly I don\\'t know exactly what to say other than that this is a great series with an actually good story and writing that makes sense. There aren\\'t huge plotholes which is extremely important for a sci-fi show. Seriously stick with this show. I watch a lot of TV and when I first started watching the 100 I found the dialogue/accuracy questionable and it seemed like just another CW show. I stayed with it mostly for the interesting concept.And wow, the second season develops into one of the most exciting programs out there right now. The storyline moves around like lightening, the characters go on believable arcs which deliver amazing transformations in some cases, it\\'s highly original and creates some fascinating dynamics between characters which you don\\'t see anywhere else. OK it\\'s not perfect (sometimes the science makes me frown) but it does so much right I barely pay attention to the increasingly rare blips now.Heading towards the end of season 2, every scene is compelling and feels important and you care about what happens because they have built it in the right way. Don\\'t expect the fluffy love stories CW is famous for, this is in no way a show just for teenagers, it\\'s not afraid to kill people, and deaths are permanent (thank goodness). The way they bring up questions of morality and strategy, the ambiguity of the characters, the head on approach to the subject matter, all are fascinating. It\\'s gritty and edgy with excellent production value and the only other program I\\'m getting the same level of epic from right now is Game of Thrones.I\\'ve never written a review before but I just had to support this show and want it to get past any stigma it created in the initial episodes. Check out the ratings in season 2, those are earned and well-deserved. Binge watch it people! You won\\'t regret it. Watched seasons 1-5 three times love this show. I learn something new every time I watch it. Love the characters, can\\'t wait for the season I started watching this because had nothing to do. First impression, low budget acting and mediocre scripters. But surprisingly, I got hooked. This show is actually good!Now we do need to warn the nerdy, let\\'s hang bugs Bunny for being historically inaccurate type of listener. A TV show is supposed to give you a break from reality so everything in it doesn\\'t have to be perfect. This is a show, a make believe world made to entertain people. It does not have to be scientifically accurate to be good! Television shows are stories, not the real world, get over it for Pete\\'s sake!First couple of episodes will leave you with a weird feeling of watching a teen drama poorly written. But trust me, it gets better and becomes quickly interesting. Gives me the impression that the whole getting to earth episodes were not written by the same person. As soon as that passage is behind you, the show gets really interesting. Got me hooked! Before watching the 100 you have to accept the obvious: it is a drama put on by the CW (the same folks that brought you 90210) about a group of 100 teens left stranded on earth by a society that has been living in space for a century. It is needless to say that the show is going to ask viewers to suspend their disbelief for the 40 minutes it takes to watch an episode. A lot of people tend to criticize the show for being unrealistic scientifically. The problem with this being that of course the show is going to be unrealistic. You have to accept that the premise of the show is that 100 teens get stranded on earth by their race of space people 100 years after a nuclear disaster.Sometimes television programs don\\'t abide by standard rules of physics, or any kind of science for that matter. Sometimes that\\'s what television is there for - to give you a break from the believable. If you are a stickler for scientific accuracy or a big fan of classic sci-fi the reality is that this might not be the show for you. If, however, you are someone looking for something exciting and (honestly) addicting to watch you might be in luck.In regards to the script I can honestly say that I suffered through 90210 cringing all the way and while some of The 100\\'s script might be a little cringe-worthy to start, it is certainly much better than most (if not all) of the teen dramas on television. This is a good show! You just have to accept what you\\'re getting yourself into. The series was off to a slow start, but it is getting better and better. The premise is original and fun, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is no doubt about it that this show is one to keep an eye on, it seems it gets darker each episode, but with that said that could also end up killing the show as a lot of viewers have accepted its violence so far because it has been done tastefully, without too much gore. Most of the bloodier scenes take place in a dark place or is carefully done by camera angles to get the point across but to not upset the CW\\'s typical viewers, and this is great in a world of The Walking Death and Game of Thrones, etc. It\\'s a welcome method of delivering the same intensity without being overly grotesque. There are too many negative comments on this website regarding this show, it\\'s getting good! I expect to see this series renewed soon. I\\'ve read a couple of these reviews, both negative and positive. I agree with both. Yes, there are definitely holes and I too believe it has a slow start. That being said, it wasn\\'t slow enough to make me not watch the second episode, or the one after that. You have to appreciate it for what it is. It has an allure, the concept is what makes it interesting. I can poke holes in every well liked show, as i\\'m sure many others can. I kept watching because I felt the show had potential, no matter what route it took. There are still things that irk me about this show, but the things i enjoy outweigh the things I don\\'t. I rated it a 10 because I went in watching it without huge expectations, and became hooked. I watched episode after episode and finished the first season in 3 days (this is watching back to back episodes after 10 hour work days). I love this show because it left me wanting more and I enjoyed watching it. They made some bold choices by deciding to show certain things as well which made it more realistic (regarding human behavior). I can definitely say it gets more exciting. I felt myself predicting things that might happen, but expecting them not too because it seemed too daring for TV, but I was pleasantly surprised. My overall advice is that you don\\'t go in watching it with this grand idea of it (not to say it isn\\'t grand, but romanticizing it in your head can easily turn into disappointment), and just give it the chance it deserves. Personally, really annoyed with Clark\\'s character. No expertise what so ever except medical and constantly making excuse for every overly stupid decision and still be accepted and obeyed from others.Ps. The show is good fun though, may be with some annoyed characters. Firstly, I ticked the spoilers box as, while my whingeing is not specific, it may give away some ideas to those that are yet to watch this.The concept of this series was great, the premise a little \\'dodgy- but-we\\'ll-live-with-it\\' and the execution was well-attempted by all.The writing, however, drove me nuts. The show could have easily been called \"The 100 Bad and ill-timed Decisions\". In attempting to heighten/prolong the drama, characters would make such stupid game-changing decisions, forcing me to smack my forehead in frustration throughout the series.Someone in charge set this show to 90% conflict and 8% angst (not to mention 2% female-on-female action), and all manner of shenanigans ensued to maintain that level.Loyalty-switching was all the rage. (I can\\'t say, \"Like they changed their underwear\", because Grounders probably go commando).There were various timely yet ill-advised massacres to ensure that peace existed only during the ad-breaks.There were several cliff-hanger countdown moments that were missed due to lengthy hand-wringing and \"Hey, we know that time is running out but let\\'s pull dramatic faces and talk about it some more\".A sprinkling of common-sense decisions would have made this so much more enjoyable.I should mention the good stuff before I run out of puff. Ricky Whittle as Lincoln gets top marks for the Grounder torn between two cultures. Alycia Debnam-Carey nailed the role of Lexa. All that violence in such a cute package. In conclusion, this is a very watchable drama but viewers will understand my frustrations as it unfolds. (A science-fiction series about teenagers sent on Earth to examine if it\\'s finally livable again after a nuclear apocalypse that happened almost 100 years ago and forced the survivors to live in space stations.)In the beginning of season 1, the 100 was basically a cheesy teen show, but then at some point the tone changed. And season 2 was what it could have been as its best: a show that explores what is morally right and wrong when you are desperate to survive. How far can you go and still be deserving of surviving? There was still unintended melodramatic tackiness in it, but it was going to the right direction.But instead of continuing with this tone and enhancing and deepening the morality aspect, they decided in season 3 to go for a shock value road. Traumatic things just happen now to characters but they are never really explored. They build up tension, then there\\'s the shocking moment, and then it\\'s ignored. Viewers don\\'t get a satisfying emotional payoff for the suspense.It\\'s like the writers are fixated serving \"unexpected\" shock value moments after another. I write \"unexpected\", because in reality they are just repeating story lines and doing do overs from a slightly different ankle. Unexpected deaths become expected deaths. Especially if you are a love interest for one of the main characters...The writers don\\'t seem to care that much, what these traumatic moments and hardships would actually do to a person and how that should affect the writing of these characters in the long run. It\\'s forgotten or it\\'s explained away with an off screen development. Or you can just write that chip in the character\\'s head made the character do it, so does it even matter what they did, said etc.?Things just happen because they happen. Because it\\'s \"shocking\", because \"you don\\'t see it coming\", because it\\'s \"surprising\"... The morality aspect and the emotional effects are wiped away. Basically whatever the characters do, they just write them to parrot: \"it\\'s us against them, I had to do it, you had to do it, my people, my people, my people, for our people\".No deeper push or a meaning is needed for a genocide. No deeper meaning is needed for wanting your sibling suddenly to die, no deeper meaning is needed to torture someone etc. Even child abuse is presented simply as a way to protect that child, because the child is \"my people, us against them, I torture my child, so no one else can use her etc.\". And then it\\'s ignored. Everything is fine again. It\\'s very cheap writing. Characters become just soulless plot devices who never stop to think or feel or reflect what\\'s happening and what are they doing. They just do whatever they have to while repeating those same old catchphrases like brain-dead robots.There is also no reason to trust any character development you think you see on the screen, because the writers seem to get fed up easily with previously written character arcs. So the characters and relationships are basically rewritten in every season. It\\'s really odd that also the relationships form \"as a surprise\". The writers seem to think that it would be boring, if there\\'s actual on screen development and the viewers would see the relationships evolving. It has to be a shock and a surprise too.But anyways, by season 5 you don\\'t even recognize the characters anymore. I guess it\\'s fun for the writers and the actors, as they get to do something new and play a different character every season, but this leads viewers to feel detached. There is no continuation or coherence in the storytelling. The characters don\\'t learn anything. It\\'s like they forget what they have experienced. They repeat the same things or are continuously unable to see the other side, even though they have self experienced that other side! And when viewers become more and more detached because of this poor and lazy writing, it leads to a realization that you don\\'t even care who survives anymore. Which is pretty bad if you are watching a survival show.The choice to mix up relationships, dynamics and even personalities and writing the characters to betray someone just because suddenly \"my people\" is different than previously, makes all their bonds seem meaningless. One moment they are friends and the next moment they torture each other, betray each other, leave each other to die etc. And again these things are ignored. They just write a fast and easy fix to start a new plot with new dynamics. Viewers don\\'t get to see the effects of betrayals on their relationships.Characters don\\'t really discuss about these things either. The dialogue becomes more and more shallow and by season 5 characters basically just repeat already used catchphrases. It\\'s very hard to sell these relationships as something true and deep, when characters don\\'t ever really seem to talk honestly and directly with each other. How can you claim that your main characters are soul mates and best friends, when you don\\'t write them to talk to each other?It\\'s so odd it becomes extremely funny when the characters have their most \"meaningful\" discussions through middle hands. They use for example the other one\\'s child or the other one\\'s significant other as messengers. Or even a dead girlfriend who talks through the head of the other one\\'s child! Whatever it takes to avoid an actual direct conversation, I guess. For some reason the writers just don\\'t want to let their own main characters, who are supposed to be best friends, to talk to each other. Weir, weird, weird.So it\\'s a very, very plot driven show. Which is kind of ironic, bc there\\'s also a lot of plot holes in it. And because the writers have such an urge to invent something new all the time (it\\'s predictable nonsense most of the time) and reinvent the characters, all the twists and turns and shocks feel very forced if you pay closer attention to them. So even a plot driven viewer needs to ignore quite a lot of stuff to enjoy it. When the pace is quick enough, I guess ignoring is possible. But when there\\'s time to reflect what actually was shown, you probably start to feel like someone thinks you are a very stupid viewer to write something like this and thinking it\\'s good enough.For a viewer who enjoys watching the development of the characters, it becomes a very frustrating show. If you like to understand the characters, get to know how they think and feel, and how situations effect them, this is definitely not a show for you. It may need a few episodes for you to get hooked, but afterwards, you´ll just want more!\\nEntwined in a scifi environment, love affairs, betrayal, loyalty, politics, science, religion, action... all come to this wonderful mix.\\nSure some parts are a little far fetched, but hey, its pure entertainment TV!\\nHave fun! It started out ok, got interesting and then every season is the same thing... over and over again.... Simply put: it is like watching 2 different shows. Approximately 3 seasons each.\\nSeasons (1, 2, 3) quiet a nice show. Full of action, drama, surprises, and unpredictability.\\nSeasons (4, 5, 6) as you go further in the series it becomes total opposite. Full of dumb fiction that is only fitted to make the main characters (Clarke & Bellamy) who by the way happen to be the top 2 annoying characters in this show ever.\\nMy Advice: Either watch until end of season 3 or Don\\'t watch it all.\\n*Spoiler Alert* ( in case you plan on watching passed season 3 )\\nTo the point that towards the end of it you\\'ll be rooting and hoping that they die especially when Clarke was so close to. However as boring and predictable it is the writer saved Clarke over and over with so many ridiculous ways including surviving a brain wipe, death by root plants while hidden in a secret hatch, and a magical CPR by Bellamy that revives her \"brain\" haha.\\nWhat is very clear, is that the worse thing about this show was the writers.\\nWhat is not clear, is why depressing characters that had so much potential and were fan favorite like Octavia, and even killing off characters earlier on that could have had much better role and added much better story in the series such as Lincoln, Finn.\\nOf course in the end, the go to another planet, kill an entire civilization and win every obstacle against all odds, by any means without losing any of the main characters (unless you count Abby as main character) and yet Clarke, Bellamy, Madi. All alive and well. Only characters that we were happy to see alive were Octavia (who was killed in last scene) and Murphy even though they turned both of them into puppies in the last season to help Clarke and Bellamy.\\nBottom line; one of those series that started well the writers started to run out of good idea so kept going with crappy ideas. A total waste to watch past 3 seasons I have to say it started a bit weak, but now I am completely addicted! Yes there are some cringe worth moments, but give it a go... the last episode was a complete turning point, and I personally cannot wait for the next episode.I remember how boring the vampire diaries was at the beginning and now it is one of the most addictive shows ever... who knows maybe the 100 will be the same.I was quite surprised with the fact that a show like The tomorrow people is still on the air, and also that it got distributed to the UK. I started watching it, and I literary could not take it anymore after 6 or 7 episodes... horribly acted! The acting in this show its quite good. I find the characters on this show a lot more interesting, probably because they are criminals, so you kinda want to know what each of them did.It also have that element of uncertainty that shows like the vampire diaries, teen wolf or the originals have, where even the main characters can be killed off, which makes the show even more interesting. So I hope it gets enough viewers to keep it going. If you combine almost every stereotypical post apocalyptic cliches , and then added bad acting, disappointing meaningless deaths and then add \" this is war\" or \"we\\'re at war\" a million times- then you get - the 100. \\nYou\\'ll be annoyed with high school type teen drama, and you\\'ll also be yelling at major characters especially Clarke. \\nBut you\\'ll still want to watch it though. OK, so I\\'m not going to waffle on about how bad the script is and how many plot holes there are to this show as I think from a run through of a number of reviews on this site... That bit is covered!It\\'s not great but what I am starting to see coming through is a fairly sincere interlacing storyline between what is happening on the Ark (the big space station with the last of the humans on it) and those dumped back on Earth.Bottom line is that it\\'s entertaining! And it is getting better too, there are even moments which remind me of Battlestar Galactica (the remade series, not the original) as resources on the Ark start to dwindle and decisions have to be made.I\\'m enjoying it, and I think that anyone else who likes to watch throw away TV and just be entertained will enjoy it too!If I have any concerns about this show it\\'s that it\\'s a little bit too \"high school\" to start with and I don\\'t see how this is going to last beyond a single series as the current plot (barring any miracles) pretty much means anyone left in space after a few months is dead?I\\'m just going to enjoy this for as long as it lasts and ignore the haters of which there appear to be many... The first two episodes have piqued my interest so far and are good sci-fi. It\\'s a best series out there right now, and it\\'s the only current one I\\'ve watched lately. I just hope it doesn\\'t have too many moral twists in it, but going back to watch ones that do is the norm too.I\\'m also in my late 40s so that, contrary to those negative and even fallacious reviews of the show claiming it\\'s a \"90210 remake\" or \"reviews use poor grammar,\\' even \"positive reviews are written by idiots or teenagers,\" _The 100_ has the potential to continue as good sci-fi, and good, positive reviews abound. You\\'ve got to populate your premise, and it\\'s a new twist on an Adam and Eve or Genesis along the lines _Earth 2_, and it\\'s a scenario that includes adult characters as well. Moreover, as at least one other review has said, _The 100_ even has some of the actors from _Lost_ in the cast. The premise is already bad. It\\'s post-apocalyptic SciFi getting the Young Adult treatment. The show is yet another attempt to cash in on the Twilight formula of taking what used to be nerd-fodder (fantasy, horror, sci-fi) and turning it into teenage/highschool drama nonsense.In addition to that, the show asks us to ignore massive internal contradictions that turn the whole premise into a joke pretty much. It\\'s bad writing in addition to bad acting.1. We are supposed to believe that the powers-to-be that preside over the last remnants of humanity (4000 people) would willingly send a sizable number of healthy, attractive breeding age females to almost certain death. That does not appear to be a particularly good idea if the survival of the species is the goal.2. We are supposed to believe that they would send their young and healthy to Earth, i.e. into mortal danger, because of resource constraints, rather than the old and sick or other non-essential persons.3. We are supposed to believe that, unless you\\'re a minor, even small infractions carry a death sentence, even though it would be highly likely that virtually everyone on such a space station would need to have very specific tasks requiring a very specific skill set - making such a scenario highly unlikely.4. We are supposed to believe that, after 3 generations on a resource-constrained space station, there is still plenty of shaving supplies, eyeliner, mascara and so on so that everyone can look like a perfectly groomed fashion catalog model.5. We are supposed to believe that out of a total population of 4000 there are 100 juvenile delinquents. 6. We are supposed to believe that they have the technology to monitor life signs in real-time from space but they don\\'t even have a single Geiger counter to measure radioactive radiation.7. We are supposed to believe that the \"delinquents\", after growing up in what one must assume to be a HIGHLY reglemented society, would go Lord of the Flies pretty much the very minute they touch down on Earth.I could continue this list, but it\\'s pointless. The whole thing is a complete mess. I was not at all into this genre of TV shows/movies, more into the comedies. So I was randomly browsing Netflix and started watching The 100, and what can I say...I got hooked to it.The show has a good plot to start with and now has multiple story lines (I\\'m talking about season 2 & I hope it\\'s not a spoiler), which makes me more curious to know what\\'s about to happen next.It might seem like it\\'s a teen thing...but once you realize how all the characters grow with time and how they blend with the plot it\\'s pretty entertaining. And I personally think the makers did a good casting and most of them are doing good at acting their roles. Though I feel Raven overacts at times.So in a nutshell, The 100 seems to be a on good start as they proceeded to season 2. I hope they will make their storyline more interesting and mature the characters further. Just amazing and wonderful. Could not ask for a better show This show is unimaginably stupid. The only thing that amazes me more than the fact that it was renewed for a second season is the fact that some people actually consider this science fiction. With their laughable portrayal of conditional gravity in orbit and magic radiation on the surface of the planet, the writers appear to harbor not only ignorance but an active disdain for basic science. The list of plot holes in this show is unending. The writers seem to delight in throwing them out there just to see if the audience is even paying enough attention to catch them or is too distracted by Paige Turco\\'s holographic eye mascara.The character development can best be described as \"schizophrenic\". The writers\\' idea of depth of character is turning antagonists into protagonists and back again sometimes within the span of single episodes. Half the actors appear embarrassed to be part of such an illogical piece of teen-drama crap and the other half are just excited to have a job. But what more do you expect from CW?There is nothing to like about this show. I fear for the intelligence of reviewers who advise turning a blind eye to plot holes and terrible writing. You have to be a certain type easily entertained simpleton to find The 100 a show worth watching.For your benefit (and as a response to the naive positive reviews) I\\'ve listed just a few of the most glaring holes and general problems with the plot below. Unless you\\'re particularly skilled at suspending disbelief to the point of completely shutting off your brain, this show is not for you.1) Portions of the Ark are rotating presumably to provide artificial gravity, a concept the artists at least peripherally understood but the script writers do not. One scene in S2E8 even involves turning gravity on and off like a light bulb. 2) Solar radiation in low Earth orbit is not the same as nuclear radiation from thermonuclear weapons detonations. Nuclear radiation from weapons detonations dissipates over the course of weeks (which is why Nagasaki is currently inhabited by half a million people, for example). 3) Even with exposure to the most intense radiation at Chernobyl, the type of instantaneous tissue damage and death from fallout radiation shown in the series isn\\'t even close to being realistic. It is apparent that the writers have absolutely no idea what radiation actually is. 4) Blood transfusions are not going to magically protect tissue from nuclear radiation. 5) 97 years is not long enough for natural selection to evolve a population of humans 4,000 strong which is 100% resistant to anything. 6) If there\\'s still enough magic radiation on the surface to instantly kill people, why did the Ark decide to wait almost 100 years before sending people down since it wouldn\\'t have made a difference either way? 7) They seem to do just fine consistently treating stab wounds, broken bones, concussions, etc. without any medical supplies or training to speak of and with a 100% success rate and an average recovery time of a day or so. 8) How could a nuclear war have succeeded in destroying not only all traces of technology but all traces of written language on the surface of the planet such that the majority of surviving humanity would be reverted some tens of thousands of years? That\\'s right, tens of thousands. We\\'ve had agriculture for the last 12,000 years. 9) The 100 happens upon a cache of automatic weapons after having been on the ground for what, a week? Meanwhile, the people who\\'ve been living on the ground for the last century have given up on technology and are throwing spears at one another and riding horses around. 10) Why did the \"grounders\" (stupid name) bother to invent a new Pidgin English language if they all still speak common English fluently and without even so much as an accent? The premise for the show is actually good, a great idea that could have been a great show, but \"The 100\" completely fails with the execution. It is nothing but a hormone infested high school drama masked as a Sci-fi show. 100 kids are sent to a previous radioactive unlivable Earth to determine if the planet is suitable for life again, great idea right? But what\\'s the first thing these kids do when they get there? Separate into groups of who\\'s cool and who isn\\'t, while anyone speaking reason that they need to find shelter/food/anything else required to survive, are just bullied and threatened with their life. As well as the normal pointless \"girl likes class clown guy who likes the girl that is serious and won\\'t pay attention to him.\" It\\'s a joke how silly this is, you\\'re the first people to step foot on Earth in 100 years and you just want to fight amongst yourselves about who\\'s cool and who gets the girl? Save yourself an hour and don\\'t watch it. The reason why I\\'m writing this review is because I see so many negative ones. True, the first few episodes were odd, and had their problems, but the following episodes cleared things up a lot, and also developed the whole thing. This show didn\\'t start out too well. Some concepts were odd. Like the technological inconsistencies. However, as you learn more about the Ark, it becomes obvious that the resource situation is hard. Make-up. Well, most shows suffer from everyone having make-up, when they shouldn\\'t. It\\'s a TV thing. What is important is the story. What I like about it is how the teens on Earth are still teens. They have their love life and general angst, but they are also trying to be adults. Sometimes it\\'s almost \"Lord of the Flies\", but then the characters stiffen their spine and make the hard choices. In a way, it\\'s like a study of society and people. Though times sometimes bring out the worst or the best in people. With all the hormones coursing through their young bodies, it\\'s even worse. One thing is for sure with this show. It\\'s not boring. Don\\'t understand the hate, great story, a bit of a roller coaster I have to admit that I created imdb account just to rate this show after watching it. Hello everyone! I have to say that I really really love the series! Especially, I love the couple Barney-Robin so bad! I learnt a lot from the gang and I really love them. I cried with them, I laughed with them, spend every moment with them. Really, I cried a lot when Marshall\\'s Dad died, and when Tracy died, I was broken :( and I had a quite tough day after. I used to think that the season ninth may be the season that I like the most, but turned out, I was wrong @@ The moment Robin said: \"We got divorced\" made me cry :(( I don\\'t know if I\\'m a sensitive person, but I cried a lot. And then when Ted stood under Robin\\'s apartment, holding the f**king blue French horn...I was totally speechless. I spent a whole day after cursing the directors, I really did that -.- All I can say is that I was totally disappointed by the end of the series. But after all, we can\\'t forget the contain just because of the ending. So I decided to see the episode 22 is the end, or at least the last five minutes were just pretending. Anyway, thanks for reading this! I love this show!! It\\'s one of the best sitcoms on the air and one of the best CBS shows!!! I disagree with the other comment - Barney is the best character. He\\'s the funniest person on the show. I love how the entire ensemble has chemistry together!! It actually feels like they\\'re friends in real life. And I don\\'t think they need new writers, they just need to grow a little more. This show gets better with time. I laugh so hard with the show that my sides hurt every time I watch. I recommend this show to anyone that has a great sense of humor and wants to laugh until their sides hurt. I hope that this show has a long run on the air. SPOILERS******I think too many people took the title of the show too seriously. A lot of people wondered why Ted decided to sit down and tell his kids a story about meeting their mother which included his ex-girlfriends. Well without some of the girlfriends, he would not have grown and become the man he did. He also would not have lucked into the opportunity of meeting their mother. And without those stories we would have not had a TV show. The show has a great combination of funny and heartfelt moments going on that I\\'ve only seen matched with Friends and Scrubs. There were some episodes along the way in season 7-9 that were forgettable but a lot of shows get like that when they\\'re on past their prime. Now that I know the full story and that Ted ends up with Robin, I want to watch the entire series over. To me it makes perfect sense to end the show the way they did, because Robin was a main character to the story and not necessarily so with Tracy. It was clear through most of the series that Robin was the one that got away from Ted and the one that had the biggest impact on him. Robin helped make Ted into the man that the kids saw and helped shape him into the man that would fall in love with their mother. Barney\\'s story was also very interesting. A lot of people felt that the writers undid all of his development in one show. The thing I like about what they did, was that it felt real. Barney\\'s character was complex. He had been let down throughout his life and had his own very deep seeded psychological problems. Those were not necessarily gone by the time he married Robin. I think they were still within him, hence the jokes that he was still able to make about other women\\'s boobs and so on. The thing Barney gained from his relationship with Robin was that she helped him love someone. She helped him see that he was capable of doing so. Little by little, Nora, then Quinn, then Robin helped Barney see that he was capable of more. I think Barney was heartbroken by his marriage with Robin. He felt that it was going to be a certain way. He was as excited if not more excited than her to be married to each other. Hence his nervousness leading up to the wedding and how perfect he wanted it to be. I just think that he couldn\\'t handle what their relationship was becoming kind of like the first go around. He loved her too much to lie to her. But he learned how to love and become a bit more stable. His 31 day spree after his divorce was more about him going to a dark place than it was about him wanting to be that guy. The other thing is that Robin never would have been able to give Barney a child. His daughter was the love of his life and I found that sweet. She changed him forever. Going back to Ted and Robin. What people might forget is that present Ted is telling the story and not past Ted. People felt like he wasn\\'t genuine in his love for the mother Tracy. I think he loved her with every ounce of his heart. Present Ted was 6 years removed from his wife\\'s death. He wanted to tell his kids the story of how he met the most incredible woman of his life. The only problem was that there was more than one woman that had that effect on him. He just didn\\'t realize the effect Robin still had on him and how important she was to him. His kids helped him realize that. He wasn\\'t the only person in the story who loved multiple people. Robin fell in love with two different men and Tracy had fallen in love with Max before Ted. The show was very real in that sense. So to sum it up, the mother was a Macguffin but a very beautiful one and one that helped the story have a direction. The last scene b/w the mother and Ted where they finally met was beautifully written and acted. And the final scene to me has not stopped running through my head. The music hit, and Robin brought out the romantic side of Ted again. No words needed to be spoken there and I\\'m happy for that. We all knew and in the end I was happy b/c these fantastic characters that I\\'ve come to love were all in a better place. I\\'ve enjoyed the first few episodes of this post \"Friends\" comedy. It really captures some of the humorous albeit awkward situations that late twenty-somethings are finding themselves in these days.Alyson Hannigan once again presents her hilarious, quirky sense of style and humor. Along with her boyfriend, Marshall, they are an excellent representation of the couple who are trying to figure out an identity in the \"not still partying like college kids, but trying not to be all grown up\" stage of life.The lead character, Ted, provides great entertainment. Audiences will be drawn in by his sensitivity and likability. He\\'s not desperate to get married, but merely ready to find the One, tired of game playing.Overall, I think this is a half-hour well spent. The humor is edgy, unpredictable, and you will find yourself reminiscing about those first few years after you graduated from college and struggled to find yourself out in the \"Real World.\" I don\\'t know if I have enough to say to fill up ten lines. I basically wanted to say that I think this is a funny show, and I hope the network keeps it. I especially like the twists and sense of mystery.I\\'ve liked Alyson Hannigan for quite a while, and I think she\\'s doing a great job in the first adult role I\\'ve seen her in (I can\\'t believe she\\'s already 31). I also think Doogie, I mean Neil Patrick Harris, plays his character really well. If you haven\\'t seen him in \"Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle\", you should. Josh Radnor also does a very good job in his first leading role.I agree that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but I think this show has a lot of elements that make a good series: good plot, good writing, good acting, and attractive cast). I think previous series like \"Friends\" have raised the bar very high for new sitcoms, but I hope that even if a series isn\\'t destined to become the next \"Friends,\" it can still be recognized as a good and worthwhile sitcom. Watched the show, thought \"Hm, I haven\\'t decided if it\\'ll stay or not\". But then the next day, my husband and I are quoting it and want to watch it again. We try again the next week, again with the quoting. I haven\\'t watched a show where there are lines that stick with me like this for a very long time. The show wouldn\\'t be anywhere without \"Barney\", but somehow none of its faults matter because I enjoy it just too darn much. Every episode there\\'s a new line, haven\\'t been disappointed so far, hoping it continues and gets even better.I mean come on, with lines like: \"Suit up!\" \"Phone Five!\" \"Not awkward guys, its only awkward if we make it awkward\"And the numerous variations of \"suit up\" are a hoot \"Snow suit up!\" \"Flight suit up\" I gotta say, I just enjoy it. There isn\\'t great philosophy, it has a laugh track, but I don\\'t miss it and end up watching the episode a couple times because its the only things worth watching sometimes. How I Met Your Mother is so worth watching! What great characters and amazing writing! This show is a Hit! Finally something to tune in to on Monday nights. Not since Friends have the characters on a sit com bonded like this. I love that there are 3 guys and 2 girls..The writing is fresh and in control and productive.....I particularly enjoy the Ted with the shirt episode - what a unique story line and all the characters just seem to work so well together. I love the added suspense of \"who is Ted going to end up with\". The character of Ted does an amazing job! He has such a cuteness and innocence about him that makes the whole premise of \"How I Met Your Mother\" really work and keeps the audience so tuned in to find out what is going to happen next! You have accumulated such a great staff of writers!!! Amazing new show! Our office is taking turns staging Monday night soirees to watch! This premise really works! Keep us the good work! Keep Monday night TV rolling along! Yeah!! Hilarious! First of all, to everyone raging how they hated the ending: Come on people, it is a TV show, for crying out loud! Get over it!For me the ending was brilliant! At least it explains Ted\\'s twisted story-telling and why it took 8 seasons before we actually got to meet the mother. And true, it was sad that she dies, but Marshall\\'s dad also passed away, which i found way more depressing. Having Ted show up at Robins apartment with the blue horn was bittersweet and basically brought it to a full circle. Barney finally committed to a female who will turn out awesome, when she grows up. Marshall and Lily are the perfect couple as you always knew they would be.I congratulate Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for having the courage to not end HIMYM like any mediocre sitcom would and want to thank them for almost a decade filled with laughter and sometimes tears (sometimes both at the same time) because the characters they created felt multi-layered and so real at times you wished they were actual friends you could hang out with at MacLaren\\'s pub. It never got boring to watch, even if Ted seems a bit whiny sometimes and when re-watching the show you finally notice that Lily is a bitch. Having said that I\\'d like to send a virtual high five to everyone involved in making this show. It was legen-... wait for it...-dary. What can I say about this show? The cast is awesome. The writers rock. The show is great. My favorite character is Barney. He is probably the main person I watch the show for. He is funny and brings a certain \"something\\' to TV that it needs. It is totally the best new comedy in awhile. While it does have a laugh track - it isn\\'t needed. Bob Sagget is right at home on this show playing the Dad. I think it is very fitting for him to be playing that role. The rest of the cast is great also. The guy who plays Ted is great at being the \\'every day\\' guy and Marshall and his soon to be wife, Lilly are perfect together. As for Robin, well she is Robin and there is nothing wrong with her. I think everyone on this show including the regular cab driver are great. This show has everything and I hope everyone gives it a chance. I love it. It is legendary. Till next week Barney. Greetings,I know it\\'s weird, but I have to confess it. Maybe I\\'m not the first guy who confess his thoughts about HIMYM.First of all, I want to thank for everything it\\'s taught me. First time I watched How I Met Your Mother TV Show, some thoughts are started to appear in my mind. It\\'s very strange to tell, I don\\'t really know how to start or how to describe it. It\\'s like panic attack, you can\\'t describe it too, you know. But these thoughts are good. I started watching in 2005. As you know start day is September 19, 2005. If I remember true, I started on October. Anyway, I have no idea what will happen in this show in the future. I have never expecting to watch it for the last episode. This show is different then others, it\\'s teaching many things to it\\'s followers; friendship, love, kindness, sacrifice, generosity et cetera and et cetera.To tell you the truth, I did not establish a deep friendship until now. I tried too much, but why is it not work, really I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. Ted, Barney, Marshall, Robin and Lily taught me too much things about friendship, love, kindness, sacrifice, generosity. I learned more. Until now, I learned that there are too many things that I must learn. You look like you have too much free time in my country. But in the end, there is a free time they seen but you have not, and they are steal your free time for nothing... Instead of this, I can travel to more country, and learn more. I can work more, more and more for me and my family, friends... It\\'s started eat my mind.Anyway, as I said, I have watched How I Met Your Mother too many times. And this show, these cast and the team, who are stayed background, taught me too many things. I\\'m still continuing to watch this show on TV. Even I realized that, I have to own bundle box of this show. I found a site, and I will buy this bundle.Maybe you said, \"I don\\'t understand why you are yelling?\" Believe me, there are some things that can hurt. HIMYM helped recognize myself. I believe that, all of these main cast is reflects an idea. Ted is ambitious for his dreams. If you believe, you can do anything. Barney is looks like lecher, but he is not. Just like Ted, he is looking for a door to happiness. Lily. Ah she is adorable and interesting person (but she is very professional to hide her thoughts). Robin is unperturbed, but she is very professional just like Lily. She is hiding her good feelings during some situations. Marshall is childish, and this is a virtue too.As you see, I discovered these emotions in these characters. All of them was a very good lesson for me; Always be an ambitious, and release your emotions while reaching to these dreams. But at the same time, be lecher for your dreams. Do interesting things and do not listen/see what people talking about yourself about these situations. And of course, don\\'t forget to do some childish things. This will make you happy.Thanks for reading. And best regards to How I Met Your Mother TV Show cast and the team, of course! Excellent series to waste some time. Perfect for the romantic souls! The story is about five friends and their love adventures, mixed up with tons of funny stories. Ted is a lonely guy, who wants to make a family, but the girl he loves does not want a serious relationship and keeps cutting off his attempts to win her heart. Marshal and Lilly are Ted\\'s best friends they are together for 9 years and are planning a wedding with all the consequences coming from that. Barny is the Casanova of the company. He\\'s funny and arrogant in a very humouristic way. The director\\'s method\\'s are different and will keep your attention in these cute series. When \"How I Met Your Mother\" first appeared on the small screen, I refused to watch it. But then I watched an episode (I think it was Episode 5 when they went to a club) and a thought it was pretty funny. I must admit that the new show isn\\'t laugh-out-loud, slap-your-knee HILARIOUS...but it has potential to be great! Every character in the CBS show (5 in total) are likable but I must give extra kudos to the characters played by Alyson Hannigan (Lily), and Neil Patrick Harris (Barney). I may be biased towards my liking of Alyson Hannigan\\'s Lily (due to her previous comedic roles: American Pie Series, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but she brings a charm and charismatic flair to the show. Also Neil Patrick Harris\\' Barney is GREAT!!! He basically plays a creep which I\\'m sure everyone is familiar with (because I know I sure am!). I find Barney hilarious!!! He IS that creepy guy at the club but that\\'s what makes him lovable.All in all this show has potential! As long as the stories, acting and writing keep up then I am definitely going to tune in! I think once people start getting to know the characters better, they\\'ll start tuning in as well. Everyone always compares this show to \"Friends\" which didn\\'t really get popular until after the first season. Hopefully, this show will continue to be funny and exceed our expectations. But WATCH IT! well. if you just look at the title, its most likely you would think its some crappy show that will probably be cancelled the first season for being extremely lame and incredibly boring. honestly, i felt this way about this show when i saw what it was going to be called..\"How I Met Your Mother\". Come on. thats what most people would expect.well, if people gave it a chance, its actually a really cute and hilarious sitcom about the main character Ted pondering on his love life and looking for \"the one\". Josh Radnor I\\'ve never heard of before, but i really do like his humor in the show. it\\'s a strange kind of humor to me though, almost dry humor. The supporting characters give great comedy to the show, esp. Neil Patrick Harris\\' character Barney. (who\\'s my favorite character in the show). Man, his character cracked me up in the pilot. I laughed continuously when everyone kept on dismissing his ideal of them all wearing suits. Its great that Doogie finally comes back to television in a great new series. Their are other great characters i feel give great comedy to the show such as the couple Lily (Alyson Hannigan) and Marshall (Jason Segal) who make a great team. They have those romantic, but hilarious scenes together where you have those laugh out loud moments. Then you finally have Robin (Cobie Smulders) who is seen as \"the one\" at first, but turns out to not actually be Ted\\'s future wife. She has her funny moments, but i don\\'t really see her as funny as the rest of the characters.Thats basically what people need to know about this show. Most of the actors we have never heard of and haven\\'t seen in movies or shows in awhile, but this is great stardom for them. It\\'s a great show for everyone to watch for it has great comedy and writing to it. It\\'s nothing really what i expected though when i saw the previews for the pilot. Just give this show a chance, you won\\'t be disappointed. It def. has a potential to last some more seasons. I don\\'t have much in the way of a review other than to say that based on the pilot, I think this show has a lot of potential to be a really good show. The cast is funny and endearing and the premise is fun. It might not be the most original idea for the show (think Wonder Years) but it has it\\'s own little twist that should make for some interesting episodes. Hopefully next weeks episode will be just as watchable and entertaining. If you haven\\'t checked it out, I recommend that you do. Alyson Hannigan and Neil Patrick Harris are the perfect complements to the show. The rest of the cast is somewhat unfamiliar to me though I must admit. I recall seeing Jason Segel in Freaks and Geeks, but I haven\\'t really seen him in anything as impressive since so hopefully he\\'ll bring the same originality he showed as Nick to his new character, Marshall. Josh Radnor is the newcomer in the bunch and he is just perfect for the part. He\\'s cute yet dorky, with a lovable charm that will certainly endear him to many female viewers. I see only good things on the horizon for this show and I hope it finds a permanent home at CBS. The perfect amount of drama and comedy.\\nEvery character is perfectly developed and very rarely go outside of their core personality. I have seen every single episode and can say that our of 208 of them I might not have liked maybe 8. All the other episodes are captivating, unexpected, funny, accurate, realistic, full of positivity, and after you\\'ve seen all of them in the end you\\'ll be a little bit better as a person. At least that\\'s what it did for me. This review will fall into two pieces, inspired by the latest 2 episodes ( seriously guys, what the f... is going on with the musical bits and ridiculous rhyming).Until season 5, somewhere mid-season 6: some of the best comedy I have ever seen. Hilarious, right on the spot, with great one-liners and characters. Absolutely wonderful.Anything after that: what the f... went wrong? Lame jokes, terrible musical bits, awful dialogue, just plain awful TV. And yet somehow, I am still watching, just to see the last episode. Com\\' on guys, this should have finished 3-4 seasons ago: on your epic legendary peakness.Thanks for all the wonderful laughs, but wow, you really overstayed your stay!! I loved this show. Unfortunately, the ninth series is increasingly putting the past tense into that statement. The whole nonsense of having Marshall travelling rather than present is tedious. And he really is important to the group chemistry, which is increasingly unbalanced. The flashbacks are getting contradictory. Dragging out 3 days into a whole series is just stupid.It is still watchable, but there is none of the magic or the emotional investment that has been present in the first 8 series. And now we have seen the Mother and having her as a permanent recurring cast member, why can\\'t we just write her in properly and get on with having Ted meet her?! How I met your mother is definitely one of the best American sitcom. It is the funniest dramas with eccentric humor I have ever seen. The producers of this comedy, Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, created an entertaining romantic story full of awkward and amusing moments, so I have not one bad word to say about it. This comedy, with interesting plot and irresistible characters, is certainly my favorite.The story is about the adventures of architect Ted Mosby and his friends, and how he met the mother of his children. However, the comedy is not similar to a traditional love-story, which begins from the moment when the romantic leads first meet each other. The structure of this drama is absolutely unique, Ted Mosby does not introduce his wife until the final season. Additionally, the series start with Ted retelling to his children in 2030 the story about how he was so close to meet their mother. He had been seeking his love for 8 years. Ted failed a lot, but his crazy friends every time provided him social and emotional support. With a lovely couple Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin, womanizer Barney Sticnson with a secret job (you also will find out it only in the final season) and funny anchor Robin Sharbatsky, Ted has unforgettable adventures and a number of ridiculous stories.How I met your mother is suitable for everyone. It\\'s a really positive, humorous and amazing comedy, which you can watch with your friends and with your family as well. However, parents need to know that this comedy focuses on flirting, love and relationships, includes sexual jokes and some vulgar language. On the other hand, some obscene things are substituted with interesting activities, and it makes stories more comical. At the same time this drama has controversial ending, which suggests that sometimes life has no happy endings. Overall It\\'s easy watching sitcom with different funny story lines, so you will never be bored. I love that they gave Aly a new show, she is so great and she deserves one. They stuck with the \"kinky girl\" persona the movie American Pie gave her, but I still like it. The show is funny and the characters are great. I can\\'t wait to see who Ted ends up with. The TV show may be a little silly at times, but I like it a lot, and I intend to watch it every Monday night. I don\\'t know if the show can have multiple seasons since it\\'s a one story type of thing, but if they can figure out how to do it, then I hope they do it. Anyways, I give high praises to the show, and I hope it sticks around longer than some of these other TV series, like Head Cases. Kandis How can I say it respectfully? hmm.... It\\'s disgustingly boring and insultingly illogical.I admit that season 1 and 2 were extremely well made. Maybe it is the reason why I am now extremely disappointed. The writers only uses tricks of \"sudden turns of events\" to generate funny moments. Having watched many episodes of this show, all I see is that characters constantly changing their beliefs, decisions, and actions back and forth without any logical reasons: we two must break up, no, we must get back together, no, that\\'s just impulse, we should still break up, no, that\\'s true love, we must get back together, no, it\\'s true love because we wanted it to be, we should break up...... The show is not making too much sense now. The five figures in the show don\\'t have consistent characters any more. You can not ask such questions: \"how could this person possibly do such a thing?\" Because you won\\'t have any logical answers. Maybe this is exactly what American shows are about: like fast food, you don\\'t need to enjoy it, just swallow what is given to you. Sometimes, you stop and think \"wait a minute, this doesn\\'t make sense, doesn\\'t XX just did something exactly the opposite a minute ago?\" No, you can\\'t. The writers just throw to you another contradictory joke and you are moving on.I feel deeply insulted watching the show. I feel that the writers assume that audience never think deeper than the superficial meaning of the jokes while watching shows, which is not true.Deeply disappointed. One of the greatest mysteries of this universe is How this show got sooo popular. People who love this show act as if F.R.I.E.N.D.S never existed. This show is a terrible rip-off of \\'FRIENDS\\' and I am insulting FRIENDS by comparing HIMYM with it. I mean c\\'mon.... the jokes are predictable and lame, the situations are kiddish, the characters live in a world of their own,the story NEVER seems to move on, they give stupid names to each and everything, the way 7-year olds do... (eg. Lets pull out the \\'mosby\\', I\\'ve won the \\'three way belt\\' etc. etc.) I\\'ve watched each and every episode of the show till date and have not laughed even once, smiled maybe but never laughed... whereas in shows like there Big Bang Theory, Friends, Seinfeld... I fall off my chair laughing at least once even if it is the nth time i am watching the episode....The only good thing about the show is Barney aka Neil Patrick Harris, probably the only reason I did watch every episode... otherwise the show is totally LAME....I give it 1/10 only because of him. When i first heard of this show i was like \"hmm, this could be interesting\" , but no, it sucks. I first saw it in my girlfriends house, and thought \"wow, this is actually pretty entertaining\" but then i began to think about the jokes, the characters... and the only thing that came into my mind was \"Friends\". \"OMG, this is a copy of friends!!!\" i thought, and i was right, it\\'s the exact same thing, the jokes the scenario the characters attitude and their friendship, it\\'s all there!! Now tell me, why would they make a reboot of the 90\\'s show? Because it sells, so why watch it? Just to prove my point i made a list of things that we have seen in \"Friends\" and that are similar in \"How i met your mother\" :MacLaren\\'s Pub / Central Perk.Monica & Chandler/Lily & MarshallRachel & Ross date / Robin & Ted dateRachel & Joey date / Robin&Barney dateJoey\\'s a womanizer / Barney is a womanizer.Barney and Phoebe don\\'t know who their dad is. Both have been lied by their mother/grandmother respectively.Ross & Ted both end up as professors.Emily didn\\'t want Rachel to be around Ross / Stella with Robin..And the list goes on...So that\\'s that, \"How i met you\\'re mother\" is like a show made for kids, it has stupid/childish jokes, it has loving/clichéd characters, and it has a moral in the end of every episode, to give us that worm feeling that everything is going to be alright... Man this show is the basic form of a US comedy, it always has been this way, and it will stay this way until people realize that sh*t like this is boring, repetitive and simple has hell, kinda like pop music these days, but that\\'s another story... This really is the most awful show. Clichéd writing and amateurish performances makes this a decidedly disappointing viewing experience. Time to bring it all to an end and move on to something watchable.The situations are poor and the execution of them is laboured. It is almost as though a team of writers have come together to think up the most obvious, in your face, situations and have then proceeded script them. One of the disadvantages of teams of scriptwriters on a show is that the ideas pass through a committee stage and most of the good ones don\\'t get through.If it were not for the US The Office I would award this the worst comedy ever. I had heard from several people that this show was \"amazing,\" \"funny,\" and any number of other wonderful adjectives. So, why had I never heard of it? It has been running since 2005 after all, and this is 7 years later. Well, Netflix supplied the answer with 5 episodes of the most recycled, predictable garbage I have ever seen on television. I didn\\'t laugh a single time, accurately predicting almost every encounter in the first few seconds and staring at the screen in baffled wonderment. How is this show popular?! This show is essentially THE prime example of our American pursuit of laziness. We don\\'t dare watch a show that challenges our thinking or is interesting in any way, we just want to watch the same crap that has been on TV since the first fart joke debuted.I digress... This show was trashy, boring, insulting to the intelligence of a kindergartner, and poorly executed at that. In short, an epic piece of utter trash that I will avoid at all costs in the future. Others are of course entitled to their opinions, but for those unsure if they\\'d like to take a chance on it, don\\'t! I would sincerely rather watch an infomercial; it would be funnier. In 1980, Gloria Monty along with other General Hospital writers decided to make a couple out of two actors that had amazing chemistry.  Genie Francis and Tony Geary who have become the phenomenal Luke and Laura.  Luke and Laura made General Hospital the unforgettable soap opera it is, and still today, Luke and Laura\\'s though painful relationship, keeps viewers going through their fascinating characterization and never ending passion between them.Alan and Monica, played by Leslie Charleson and Stuart Damon, Frisco and Felicia, played by Jack and Kristina Wagner, Robert and Holly, played by Tristan Rogers and Emma Samms, Sonny and Brenda, played by Maurice Bernard and Vanessa Marcil, and Luke and Laura have showed every other soap opera the definition of a \"love story\".  Though never simple, always intense, always unforgettable.General Hospital has also shown amazing technique in storylines that are not love stories.  Such as Monica Quartermaine\\'s heartwrenching breast cancer storyline in 1994, or the amazing storyline of two little girls dying, yet only one miracle came out of it.  I could only be talking about Bobbie Spencer\\'s and Tony Jones\\'s daughter BJ giving her heart to Frisco and Felicia\\'s daughter Maxie, in the last moments to save her life.  These stories touched many viewers and there are so many more.Some of the most precious moments on daytime television have occurred on General Hospital, and the highest rated moment on daytime television was Luke and Laura\\'s wedding in 1981.  It was said to be the only wedding ever to rival Princess Diana\\'s.  General Hospital has created feelings, storylines, and characters that go beyond words.  I thank Genie and Tony who play Luke and Laura for bringing out the fantasy we all have about how love should be.  Though they are General Hospital\\'s greatest achievement, I don\\'t think General Hospital\\'s done with them yet!  And we know that Luke and Laura are not the only life changing storyline they\\'ve come up with!  Thank you General Hospital! I am not one for soap operas, however, General Hospital is different. However dramatic this show gets, I can never get enough of it! It is actually kind of funny how I got started watching it. One time when I was little, my mom was mad at me as I wouldn\\'t calm down or sit still so she made me sit down and read while she watched general hospital. I remember half watching over my book when the show ended, and for some reason, I cared about what happened to Jason, so I made a point to watch it the next day and I have never missed an episode since! This is by far the best show on TV and it comes highly recommended. Hope this helps, Fletcher General Hospital is a long running soap opera that had wonderful leadership with Gloria Monty and Wendy Riche and amazing writers like Claire Labine. Also great performances by John Beradino,Rachel Ames, Tony Geary,Genie Francis,Tristan Rogers,Finola Hughes,Kimberly Mccullough,Vanessa Marcil,Alicia Leigh Willis and Billy Warlock.Tristan Rogers and Finola Hughes were incredible as Robert and Anna in the 80s and 90s where GH was filled with action,adventure and romance.\\nThe highlight of the 1990s included storylines of the family. BJ Jones\\'s death, Monica Quartermaine fighting breast cancer, Stone and Robin\\'s love story and their AIDS storyline. Plus the amazing chemistry and connection that made Sonny&Brenda soulmates.GH hit a rough patch in 2000-2001 with many backstage changes but it is improving in 2002. One of the most promising current storylines is the AJ Quartermaine and Courtney Matthews relationship. Billy Warlock and Alicia Leigh Willis have phenomenal chemistry that makes watching in 2002 a must. After Santa Barbara, Guiding Light, Another World, and One Life to Live, the Soap Butcher Jill Farren Phelps has placed her friends in high position often ruining such high quality shows. When I was watching Guiding Light, it was at its peak in 1991. They fired the producer and replaced them with Butcher Phelps. She drove Beverlee McKinsey away by overworking her to death. She killed off beloved Ellen Parker\\'s character Maureen. So Parker won an Emmy but the loss was much worse for the audience. On Another World, she killed off Alice Barrett Mitchell\\'s beloved Mary Frances Frame Winthrop in a ridiculous storyline. On One Life to Live, I could only imagine what she did to that show which took years recover. Now she is ruining General Hospital by driving the great John Ingle away to Days Of Our Lives where he received a contract role. I feel sorry and sympathy for Jed Allan because he has a tough act to follow. The Quartermaines used to be the funnest family on television completely. She drove the great Dame Anna Lee away right before her death. Now Kristina Malandro Wagner refuses to return unless she gets a contract for playing Felicia Jones. Why aren\\'t the veterans of this getting the short end of the stick? I bet Gloria Monty is livid over the show getting Best Drama Emmy under Phelps. I know Monty\\'s heart was always in the right place with this show and her last time around wasn\\'t successful as the Luke & Laura days but still, I know Butcher Phelps track record with soaps. Nobody in the real workplace would allow somebody whose cost so much damage to so many people. I am glad that Robin Strasser is speaking against Phelps\\' known favoritism for certain actors. I am going to single them out now on General Hospital because it would be unfair. But I know after 25 years of watching soaps, I could do a better job to satisfy both fans and the cast and crew. I am sorry but Phelps is just a Soap Opera Butcher to me. I know Guiding Light was great at the time but she made terrible decisions which cost fans. Now Guiding Light might be up for cancellation! the cast and crew took a pay cut to keep the show afloat. Remember Another World! Phelps was there before she jumped ship to One Life To Live. What goes on behind the scenes must be more fascinating than on screen. Guiding Light and Another World were creations of another daytime diva or queen Irna Phillips who would be turning over in her grave if she knew what this woman has done to her children.Now Phelps is killing off Alan Quartermaine who has been played faithfully by Stuart Damon for 30 years. I\\'m concerned that she is going to lose one of the show\\'s best attributes, the Quartermaine Family. She and the network practically drove Anna Lee out over a contract dispute. Even with John Ingle\\'s welcome return, the shadow over the show is still different. I don\\'t blame cast members like Leslie Charleson and others for being so vocal about Damon\\'s departure. It\\'s as shocking as it comes. This is what you get when you have somebody like Phelps at the helm. i have been a viewer since 1963, watched in black and white, was 13, and still watching. i have seen them come and go on this show and it\\'s still the best one on TV. it has had it\\'s ups and downs and always manages to come out on top. remember Jesse? Audrey and he sister Lucille? that was back in the day! i do so miss the Luke and laura thing. Luke just isn\\'t Luke without laura. Anthony Geary has only improved with age. Luke is all that and more. GH also has the best looking guys and the sexiest, is Jax gorgeous or what? Jason is sooooooooo smooth, and all that too. it will always be hard for the writers to top the original Luke and Laura storyline,it dosen\\'t get any better then that, but they have kept me watching all these years. to every one that is associated with the show, keep up the good work The show has really hit a stride when it had Luke and Laura saga and how thirty million for a TV audience in the daytime at the time watch their wedding. As it was a big thing. This was also the year where Diana and Charles married along the way. Couples like them, Frisco and Felicia in the past to Dante and Lulu in the present. Make the soap as the super couples. Be why the soap has been popular.Also the hospital thing known as scrubs as the daily scoop of the inner workings of the hospital. Hence the title! In upper NY! Like doctors, nurses, cops etc.Set the star thing for future superstars like Demi Moore, Rick Springfield, John Stamos among them. A treasure! I\\'m so tired of people saying that General Hospital is just a stale old soap opera.  GH has been a staple of ABC\\'s daytime lineup for 39 years.  It\\'s 3rd in the ratings and I think that ain\\'t half bad considering it\\'s age.  The Alexis, Sonny, Carly triangle is a masterpiece destined to go down in GH\\'s extremly long history.  The actors and actresses who portray the characters on the show are fantastic and so are the writers.  I get very upset when people say that it\\'s a stale soap.  So when GH tries to do something exciting and fun people say that it is not true soap storytelling. Just like the revival of the Cassidines (Helena, Stavros).  I thought that that was a great storyline.  In closing I would just like to say that General Hospital is on the track to taking back the ratings crown from The Young and the Restless.  Your the greatest GH!!!! When I was a kid in the 70s, I watched soaps with my mother. It was all the ABC ones. All My Children, One Life to Live and General Hospital. When I was about 12 or 13. Luke and Laura got married, I wanted to see it so bad, I told my mother I was sick and stayed home from school. Over the years I stopped watching the other two and stuck with GH. It\\'s still the best soap I\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s not as good as it used to be but it\\'s good. I would love to see less Sonny and Carly and more Luke and (whoever). When Luke was the hero, the show as truly great. Since now it\\'s all about Sonny, it\\'s getting really boring. The same old mobster stuff, Sonny isn\\'t heroic he\\'s a crook.Maybe in the future GH will regain it\\'s backbone. Maybe draw clear lines between good and evil like it did in it\\'s hey day.Rayvyn General Hospital used to be a great show. Back in the late-70\\'s and early 80\\'s..it was THE SOAP to watch.In the early 90\\'s, when Claire and Matthew Labine took over head writing duties, General Hospital spotlighted so many fantastic, heartwrenching, and honest stories. I mean, what fan of this show will EVER forget Stone and Robin\\'s love story. Stone, dying of AIDS-blind due to it...takes his last glimpse of his love, Robin by a window and hapilly says \"I can see you\"...then passes away. Or will the forget the Breast Cancer storyline, when Monica cuts her bandages off to see that she has no breast, and she just begins to cry uncontrollably. Or, the revolutionary and GUTSY storyline when young Maxie is dying from a heart condition, and is need of a transplant. At the same time...her cousin Barbara Jean (B.J.) is rendered brain dead in a school bus accident. Tony and Bobbie decide to donate her organs. Meanwhile Felicia (Maxie\\'s mom), gets the news that a donor heart has been found. So she goes to Bobbie happy that they have found a heart for her daughter. Her happiness turns to horror when she finds Bobbie crying. Instantly, Felicia knows...\"Noooo. Not Barbara Jean. Not Barbara Jean\\'s heart.\"And she collapses to the floor, crying. I cry now as I think about it, and this was ten years ago. And then the scene where Tony hovers over Maxie, as she recovers from the transplant. And he leans down and places his ear over her chest to hear the beating heart that belonged to his deceased daughter. Oh man...This was OUTSTANDING TELEVISION!Sadly, GH has regressed so much under the watch of Bob Guza, Jr. I don\\'t care what anyone says....it\\'s BLASPHEMY to put a Spencer with a Cassadine!!! To me...this show is long gone. With the loss of some of my favorite actors (Johnathan Jackson, Amber Tamblyn, Kimberly McCullough, Sarah Brown), and some truly horiffic writing, storylines and pairings....I can never watch this show with the same enthusiasm as I did ten and twenty years ago. For me though...there are few saving graces for this show. The Quartermaines\\': John Ingle...whom not only has filled the shoes of David Lewis\\' \"Edward Quartermaine\" character...but has greatly improved on the original (and this is saying A LOT, as David Lewis was FANTASTIC as Edward), Leslie Charleson, Stuart Damon, Anna Lee, Jane Eliot (always a good watch when she returns from time to time), and Robin Christopher (GREAT). Maurice Benard as \"Sonny\" still delivers the goods. And of course, Tony Geary as \"Luke Spenser\". I just wish the material was better. Sadly, unless the Labines come back, or someone can be the second coming of Gloria Monty...I\\'ll just be a viewer on occasion. I don\\'t watch soap opera shows any more because I just don\\'t have the time to watch a show that you have to watch every day but when I did watch soap operas, I watched General Hospital which I started watching when I was in high school when a class mate told me about the show and got me interested. I started watching General Hospital sometime in the 1980\\'s shortly after Luke and Laura got married and I watched it on and off again for several years and though I don\\'t really watch it anymore I still keep up on what is going on by reading about it in the soap opera guide in the newspaper. The only other soap operas I also sometimes liked watching were, One Life To Live, All My Children, and Santa Barbara but I much preferred General Hospital and only watched those other soaps for a short while. Once upon a time there was a \"story\" that brought the kids home from school just to see it. It was called \"DARK SHADOWS\", but then later another soap did the same thing, it was called GENERAL HOSPITAL. In the early 80\\'s this show managed to rise above it\\'s soapiness with sharp writing and novel concepts that attracted the younger viewers female AND male. Throughout the 80\\'s and early 90\\'s GH managed to ride on that loyal fan base. But during the last 7-8 years GH has struggled mainly due to LOUSY WRITING. The current scribes seem to think the audience wants to watch heroic crime-lords break the law and beloved characters die horribly. It\\'s a shame that this once cutting edge show has devolved into a show about a mobster, his moll and his cardboard cut-out henchman. ABC should either fire the current writers and producers or PULL THE PLUG on this terminal soap. Back in September, I thought GH was finally starting to improve but sadly that was a brief improvement and it is now downhill. Soap Operas have similar storylines sometimes but General Hospital only has the same recycled storylines. The show is predictable and boring. General Hospital has a large and wonderful cast including Robin Christopher, Nancy Lee Grahn, Tony Geary, Rebecca Herbst, Leslie Charleson, Billy Warlock, Stuart Damon, Chad Brannon and so many others. Yet General Hospital seems to waste this large ensemble cast and only use them to prop up four characters, known as the drab four (Sonny,Carly,Jason and Courtney) by some fans. General Hospital has turned into a wanna be Sopranos. They hardly ever showcase the hospital or the families. They have backburned older characters or gotten rid of them, like original cast member Rachel Ames (Audrey Hardy). The show now puts down the police and strong women like Alexis, Elizabeth, Monica and Carly. The writing is god awful and the pairings lack chemistry and are forced, especially the pairing of Jason and Courtney. Alicia Leigh Willis\\'s Courtney showed promise in the beginning but without Billy Warlock\\'s AJ the character and actress is a disaster. Nancy Lee Grahn\\'s Alexis was once a strong independent lawyer who is now reduced to dressing like a man to see her daughter. General Hospital is now the worst show. It is appalling.General Hospital needs to write better for it\\'s women, for the police and for all it\\'s characters. They need storylines about family, love, adventure and storylines that are not about the mob. They need couples with actual chemistry that sizzle like Steve Burton and Rebecca Herbst\\'s Jason and Liz, Zander and Emily or Alexis with either Luke, Ned, or Cameron. Ted King\\'s return as Lorenzo Alcazar is a great move but GH does not need more characters. It needs balance, and great writing. I watch General Hospital all the time, and i must say, it is the best the ever! It is a SoapOpera, but, i think even men will enjoy it. (I say that because men do watch it, but mostly women) There is just enough action to keep the men interested, and enough passion to keep the women. The show is just a good show, point blank! Its plots are amazing, you never know what will happen next. Also, the characters are written to a Tee, so you fall inlove with them, and end up picking favorites, and picking those you don\\'t like! Some people say the show is not good anymore, but i disagree. If you were to of watched back in the day, it had a much different feeling, now, mob families rule Port Charles (where General Hospital is located) But, story lines don\\'t just center around that. If you decide to give GH a try, some characters you should look for are Edward, Monica, Alan, Luke, Tracy, Bobbie, Leslie and Audry. They are have been on the show for a long time. This show is my opinion, out of a 1-worst, 10-Best, id give it a 9. It is always keeps me entertained, but, nothing is perfect, even General Hospital! I began watching in the fall of 1996.It was the time when the Spencer/Cassadine feud was reignited.This, in my opinion, was the show\\'s peak.The best characters/actors in daytime were front and center.Sonny Corinthos/Maurice Benard,Jason Morgan/Steve Burton,Luke Spencer/Tony Geary,Lucky Spencer/Jonathon Jackson,Carly Roberts/Sarah Brown.They made the show worth watching.Now,9 years later,only 3 of them remain.Long past his prime,Luke has been reduced to a series of boring plots involving the always annoying Skye.The only reason i still watch is for Sonny and Jason\\'s scene\\'s,but the writers insist on saddling them up with depth-less arm candy(Reese and Sam).Also,the formidable Jonathon Jackson had great chemistry with his costars,Tyler Christopher,Amber Tamblyn,Becky Herbst,Genie Francis and especially Tony Geary.All subsequent Luckys have paled.(Although I do like Jacob Young on All My Children) I have been watching this show since 1996. I started watching it when Carly and sonny were just getting together. So thats who i fell in love with. To this day still love them. And for all of the people who think that they should take sonny of because he\\'s just a gangster and a crook well there wrong. Sonny has brought a sexy danger to port Charles. he is the one man who you want to kiss and the man who you want to save you. The whole mobster thing is great. He loves his family and he would never hurt them. He does what he has to, to take care of them. To this day there is never a dull moment in Port Charles. I wish Sonny and Carly would get together again and that Jason and Elizabeth would get with each other. I started watching this soap 10 years ago. I loved watching Jonathan Jackson as Lucky. He is the reason I started watching. Now I wish that I\\'d stopped when he left. If someone asked me to pick my favorite storyline I\\'d have to tell them that there\\'s no way I can pick just one.Sadly I can\\'t say that I\\'m enjoying what I\\'m seeing on my TV now. This show used to have characters that were worth rooting for and that you loved to hate. Now all it has is pathetic wannabe mobsters and characters you just hate. You\\'re forced fed basically 4 characters Sonny, Carly, Jason and Courtney. The writing on the show is horrible and some of (if not all) the acting is horrible. Couples with no chemistry are on every single day (Jason & Courtney) while others who used to be great (Sonny & Carly) have become boring and props for other couples. I want the General Hospital that I used to love. I want the GH was more then just boring mob stuff, the GH that actually had a hospital in it not just Sonny\\'s place, the GH that actually cared what fans thought not just what a certain fan base wants. For the first 15 years or so, General Hospital was a basic medical show on daytime TV. Nobody watched.Enter Gloria Monty, who turned the show into a ratings winner. She created the Luke and Laura phenomenon, and expanded on that with far-fetched stories and international intrigue. Eventually, it became stale, as did the Luke and Laura story.Enter the 90s. New producers and writers completely changed the image of the show, from romance and intrigue to a show that set out to inform the world about diseases such as AIDS and breast cancer (something that numerous soaps had done before). Although it is good to be socially aware of the world around them, General Hospital was not like that before.Nowadays, General Hospital resembles every other soap on the air. There is no way someone can distinguish General Hospital from another show. The stories you see on this show are just like the ones you can see on any other show. And that\\'s a shame.Side note: the show rarely even takes place in the hospital anymore! What\\'s the point of calling it \"General Hospital\" when no story takes place there? And I think there are only 3 characters who are even connected to the hospital. Hello! Don\\'t be fooled by the title.  While back in the golden ages this soap may have been centered around a hospital but now it\\'s main focus really centers around the mob.  I can\\'t say that I know it was better years ago because GH had been on many years before I was born.  The storylines of today are really lacking.  Golden couple Luke and Laura aren\\'t on the screen and we are forced fed pathetic excuses of chemistry such as the Jason and Courtney storyline.Like most soaps General Hospital gets caught up trying to make a steamy romance build up for May to try to gain teenage viewers.  This means that we usually get some 19 to 20 something airhead with a past blow into town and start what the writer\\'s think is a romance with a favored regular.  I am a teenager and I can tell you now that I could care less how old some of the cast members are, I want to see real romance!  Although I may not have been around to see some of the blossomings of past couples that doesn\\'t mean I don\\'t care!The one good actress that GH has is Robin Christopher who has played Skye Chandler on three daytime soaps and very well!General Hospital was once the most graced and respected shows on daytime TV but like most all other soaps bad writing has lost a lot of loyale viewers and failed to gain new ones.  If you\\'re already a soap watcher then it may be worth your time to try it but if not then there isn\\'t much for you. General Hospital struggled for awhile with bad writing but it is improving each and every day. It has once again become a tv show that you can\\'t miss.The pairing of Billy Warlock\\'s AJ and Alicia Leigh Willis\\'s Courtney is a breath of fresh air and they shine in an \"us against the world\", \"making him a better man\" love story.The true love story of Steve Burton\\'s Jason Morgan and Rebecca Herbst\\'s Elizabeth Webber is amazing. It\\'s full of friendship, loyalty, trust,passion,angst and love. Jason and Elizabeth are soulmates They are the best since the early days of Luke and Laura and Sonny&Brenda.\\nThe return of Vanessa Marcil as Brenda and Ted King as Alcazar is adding much excitement. All GH needs to do is reunite soulmates Sonny and Brenda and it will be all set.Also needed is storylines for Brad Maule, John J York, Stuart Damon and Leslie Charleson, Rachel Ames, Real Andrews and a good new romance or the return of Emily for Zander.These characters,couples and actors leave you wanting more and put their hearts in to their work. With improved writing General Hospital is the best soap opera to watch. I have watched this show for as long as I can remember. I was born in 77 and watched as a little kid. My parents were fans and I got into it (they both watched all ABC soaps). I was also a fan of AMC/OLTL/Loving/Port Charles. I knew people felt it was weird for a guy to like soaps but I didn\\'t care... I was hooked. I remember VCR days and taping every show so I could watch after school and rushing home to catch GH in time LOL! I have fond memories of characters staring out on the show that are still on today. Luke and Laura, Frisco and Felicia, Robert and Anna, The Q\\'s and all the bickering and backstabbing, Robin being there since she was a kid... etc. The show has changed a lot over the years but I would like to think I am as much a an today as I was back in the day. Get Rid of Nell this is ridiculous no one after all this waiting for Micheal to get his baby back wants to watch this O.K., so I didn\\'t start watching \"GH\" in April of 1963 (I was only a month old), but found this as a teen in late spring 1979 just as Heather was about to take the L.S.D., Monica announced she was pregnant with a baby (now A.J.) and Laura and Scotty were dealing with issues in their young marriage. 34 years later, Heather is in a mental institution, occasionally springing back up to make some L.S.D. caused psychotic rant, the widowed Monica is supporting A.J. in his bid for ELQ president, and Laura and Scotty are arguing over the man who initially broke them up. Thousands of episodes later with so much having happened in the meantime, I find this enjoyably ironic and can\\'t wait until Monday to see what happens...My joke today is \"Guess where GH was today! The hospital!\" Yes, the hospital still hasn\\'t disappeared, but psychotic royal families and mobsters have taken over the majority of the episodes. Steve Hardy, the late patriarch of the hospital, is occasionally mentioned and honored, and his still beautiful widow Audrey may yet pop up again as she did recently for a dedication to him. His granddaughter Elizabeth is a nurse there, her brother (and his namesake) Steven recently was forced to resign when sent to prison for an out of state crime, and those who were around during his time share his dedication. The show\\'s veteran character, Dr. Monica Quartermain, is now chief of staff, unfortunately rarely seen (except for the occasional family squabble), and is a waste of talent for the still beautiful Leslie Charleson. Her recent reunion with former rival Lesley Webber (the exquisite Denise Alexander) shows how much \"GH\" needs its roots back as opposed to the darkened ones of the many blonde\\'s who dominate the screen.As talented an actor as Maurice Benard is, this show is \"GH\", not \"GM\" (General Mob-sital) and after years of mob-focused story lines, \"GH\" has divided the show\\'s focus between multi-generational characters. The writing is sometimes strong and the use of history amazing. Fortunately, vintage \"GH\" episodes have become available for viewing so young fans can research the show to see why \"GH\" in the late 70\\'s and 80\\'s was a true phenomenon. That brings me to the show\\'s leading man, Anthony Geary\\'s Luke Spencer, a character I found overrated years ago during the Ice Princess storyline, yet came to like as his older version of Luke was revealed to be truly flawed and not the super-hero the old regime under Gloria Monty made him out to be. I also like the fact that the 2013 version of Genie Francis\\'s Laura is much stronger, still kind but nobody\\'s patsy, even the sardonic Tracy Quartermain\\'s. Jane Elliott is a riot, stealing every scene with her presence, and in spite of their bitchy repartee, you can tell that Tracy and Monica have come to love each other in spite of old wounds often being brought up.The younger generation of Q\\'s, Corinthos, Webbers, Spencers and Cassadines are all taking on the reign of focus, and in spite of the fact that many veterans have been written off (Bobbie, Alan) or made recurring (Felicia, Monica), there are always glimpses of the glory days. Mentions of brothers Rick and Jeff Webber, original head nurse Jessie Brewer, Lee and Gail Baldwin and the late Edward and Lila are nostalgic. Seeing pictures of Anna Lee and John Ingle on the Quartermain mantle give hope for the show\\'s continuance. The show also supplies some delicious comedy whether it be Stuart Damon\\'s ghost of Alan showing up to play referee between Tracy and Monica, batty Heather going ballistic over a vampire\\'s look-alike brother, or the delightful \"dominator\" Alice displaying girl-like innocence as supporting young love. The return of long-ago veterans like Finola Hughes, Robin Mattson, Kin Shriner, Lynn Herring and Denise Alexander reminds us of the glorious \"GH\" past, which included such wonderful favorites of mine like Susan Pratt, David Lewis (the original Edward), Frank Maxwell, Judith Chapman, Tonja Walker, Matthew Ashford, Constance Towers (replacing Elizabeth Taylor as the evil Helena) and even short-term roles whose memories haven\\'t gone away played by Melinda Cordell (spy \"Natasha\"), Adrienne Barbeau, Janis Paige (an Auntie Mame like forger), and Michael Learned, so sweet to Elizabeth as a dying patient.I was never a Felicia/Frisco fan, never interested in Sonny/Brenda, and tuned out for a while regularly after Lesley Webber was \"killed off\" in 1984. But every so often, if I caught the Q\\'s on screen, I\\'d tune in for their witty \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" like conflicts, wanted to jump through my screen to hug Aunt Ruby (we should all have one!), and finally cheered for joy when Tracy made her 1989 comeback. So while \"GH\" hasn\\'t had my loyalty all the way since 1979, I\\'m like the prodigal son who can occasionally leave for greener pastures, but always ends up home. Bradford Anderson and Jason Cook are working on a new project called Genreful. Had a friend send me this link. Looks really interesting! Looks like Jason Cook with be directing and Bradford Anderson is acting. What a great combo. There\\'s a neat little video on the Genreful link with Jason Cook talking about the project. But if you are a supporter of the projects there are some awesome giveaways and incentive to get involved. It\\'s pretty interesting the way they set it up. Plus Stephen Hanson is involved as a producer in the project. I\\'ve heard some great things about him as well and has some cool films in the works. I\\'m looking forward to getting involved in it myself and maybe meet them! http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1197586098/genreful?ref=search So am I deeply concerned about the future of GH\\'s wonderful and exciting plots! I\\'ve been watching this soap opera for nearly one month! General Hospital had its own recommendation in my case and I had it described in the best possible quality. I was considering me joining the show and start belonging to this world,world of GH and its fans. As you can guess,I made up my mind to become a part of GH! And I still do not dare to use any bad or negative word for describing it!First of all,I would like to mention,that this soap opera really makes my every day. It is still alive and active in my dreams, it is inside me, it\\'s a living soul in my heart. Never before have I been so obsessed about any soap opera. General Hospital can boast about its remarkable climate,atmosphere. Every episode starts with jumping from one scene to another. It\\'s really gorgeous. It is some kind of quick skin. You can take pleasure from enjoying 5 or 6 various scenes of sometimes different stories. It makes this soap opera look versatile. It is my impression,my constant impression. What is more, General Hospital has a very fresh stories. It is linked to the world of drama, sensation...it\\'s also stocked with joke,fun,here I have this entire story with Kate Howard and Sonny Corinthos on my mind. Their quarrels,fights and \\'arguments presentations\\' have this power to make viewers laugh loudly in front of their TV\\'s or computers... Furthermore,GH shows totally different characters. We watch characters,that are absolutely opposite to each other. Jerry Jacks/Jax Jacks - Jerry,who was named Craig was torturing 15 people in a hotel,treating them with a little bit of cruelty,with no honour and goodness. Jax is his younger brother,capable of sacrificing his own private life for his bad brother! Jax is the ideal brother,husband,son... Jason - Lucky. Jason is this type of man,who is supportive for women,calm,who usually respects others. Lucky is a volcano! Lucky was abandoned by his own father,Luke Spencer,that\\'s why his behaviour makes others feel very bad for him. Disappearing of Jake let this whole amount of Lucky\\'s anger appear and start making trouble in his life. Lucky,instead of comforting his wife Elizabeth, accused her of turning back on Jake! It made me furious! There are a lot more opposities,but I would like to leave this aspect now.Last events in GH are remarkable! Disappearing of Jake,Sam\\'s secrets,that are coming out,Jax,who is searching for his brother,Luke taking Laura etc.! I\\'m just after the episode from the 27th of June and I...I am only about to say,that I\\'m dying to watch the next episode!Cheerz! Just awful, I don\\'t recommend, don\\'t waste your time, just one word can describe and the word is awful, pure garbage. This is my first review ever, so please bear with me.Happy Endings was a terribly underrated and under-watched show that deserves very high praise. It blows both Friends and How I Met Your Mother completely out of the water (and trust me, I love both of those shows too). Each character was unique, well-developed, and hilarious! The show has a really distinct feeling to it. It was modern in the best kind of way. Penny, Max, Brad, and Jane were definitely standout characters for me. Alex and Dave were great too, but I have to admit they were not quite as interesting as the other four. Nevertheless, this show really let us get to know each character both individually and in the group setting. Plenty of memorable guest stars helped to round out the cast.The writing is smart and funny. There are inside jokes that are recurring throughout the series. I keep finding great jokes upon multiple viewings. It\\'s both laugh-out-loud funny and make-you-think-a- little funny. This is the one show that I would pick if I could pick any show to come back onto the air. I would even give back season 4 of Arrested Development and the Veronica Mars movie (both of which I love) for more Happy Endings*. If you haven\\'t seen this show, watch it right away and fall in love with this amazing group of friends like I did.*EDIT: Okay, I may have been a bit over-dramatic with that statement... I\\'m actually just writing this to save this show, as it might get canceled soon. I love this show, and it SO does deserve another season! As I live in Denmark I feel really powerless, because I cannot watch it and help the ratings. I love the characters and the plots of the episodes. This show and New Girl are the best new comedy shows and I really want them to continue. The cast is excellent and the writers are amazing and I simply cannot believe the ratings are that bad. So I want to ask all that can have an influence in saving this show, to spend a little time and watch the show so it can survive. It will mean a lot to me and lots of other people. Please just watch this show and help it survive! Please... This show is simply superb. The deliverance, character development, and plots of each episode are amazing. Overall the show is hilariously quick-witted (similar to 30 Rock and Community).The pilot doesn\\'t really do the show justice though. All of the characters are quirky in their own way, and they all get into antic situations. I\\'d recommend watching at least the first two episodes to get a feel for what the show is really like. Honestly, I can\\'t wait to see how the show evolves from here, I\\'m sure it will be amazing!I recommend Happy Endings if you like shows like: Modern Family, 30 Rock, and Community. Do yourself a favour and WATCH THIS SHOW! I guarantee you wont be disappointed. I\\'ve watched the first two episodes of this show this afternoon.To be honest, I gave it a try because it was Elisha Cuthbert, who I really liked since watching \\'The girl next door\\'.After the first couple of minutes I knew this might be a great show. The acting is great,each of the characters has something different and unique, the dialogs are funny and you get great moments of laugh. I hope this will not change later. Overall, I highly recommend this show if you\\'ve watched \\'The 70s show\\' or \\'How I Met Your Mother\\'. I can hardly wait for more episodes. Hopefully this will not get canceled after a few episodes like a lot of other great shows were (like Firefly or Pushing Daisies. This is the funniest sitcom since Arrested Development. It\\'s witty, sharp, and twisted. It gets compared to Friends a lot but the characters are jerks to each other in a similar setup as Seinfeld or Curb your Enthusiasm.Elisha Cuthbert who was the weakest link in season one has improved tremendously. She has great comic timing in playing the ditz Alex. Damon Wayons Jr. shines as Brad. He takes all the great comic attributes of his father and adds his own hilarious spin. I also love how Adam Pally as Max breaks the homosexual stereotype. He thinks just like a straight man and is rude, obnoxious, and hilarious.Every member of the cast is great and the pop culture references are as Penny would say \"Ahmazing\" When you can have a sex dream about the mom on the 90\\'s comedy dinosaurs you are a pretty funny show. Season one is good but season two and three are where the cast really shines. Check the show out if you love Community, Arrested Development, Peep Show and other witty comedies. I liked Friends but I prefer Happpy Enings! I read an earlier review comparing this show to \\'Friends\\'. They couldn\\'t be more wrong. Sure, its got the typical cast of 3 main female character and 3 main male characters, some who are in relationships and some who are single, but this seems to be the norm to most new sitcoms (ie. How I Met Your Mother, Big Bang Theory etc.) This show on the other hand is quite refreshing in a way that makes it comparable to other popular past sitcoms, yet is original and different. Flashbacks during scenes remind you of Scrubs and Family Guy yet do it in a way that doesn\\'t make it seem like they\\'re stealing that idea. You\\'ve really got to see it to know what I mean.So far, while writing this review only four episodes have been shown, and quite honestly, I can\\'t wait for the next one to come out. The characters all have their own unique qualities that make them interesting and i\\'m sure that as the series goes on we\\'ll get to know more about them.In my own personal opinion I would definitely recommend Happy Ending to anyone willing to open themselves up to a new sit-com. There have been a lot of Friends knockoffs over the past few years, most of them forgettable, some regrettable, but this is one funny show.It\\'s well written, fast paced, very funny. The characters are well defined individuals, each with their own quirks without being quirky.The first five episodes have all been laugh out loud funny. The situations have been believable and relatable but go to very funny surreal places. It\\'s creative but the creativity all comes organically from the characters so it never seems forced.Also, no laugh track, no setup-punchline timing to make you feel stupid. This show is simply spectacular. I\\'ve not had any high expectations when watching comedy pilots this TV year - especially not couples comedies.I still thought I should give this a shot because I\\'m a fan of Coupe and Cuthbert. I can simply say that I loved it.The chemistry between the actors are hard to put into words, their acting skills and the writing of the show all combined together make this into such a good show.I\\'m so glad that this show has aired - and I can finally watch a new comedy that makes me really laugh hard when watching - yet enjoy the different aspects of the writing and still be humored by the quality of the episodes and their story lines. Witty, hilarious, full of fun and replay-ability on a Seinfeld or Friends level, but updated for a new generation. I felt like this was one of those shows that got canceled way too early. I loved it. Still do. I wish there were more episodes. I had my doubts about this show at the beginning. I started watching some episode because it aired right after Modern family. But after watching a couple of random episodes, I started to get interested.The characters really grew on me, I really recognize my friends and I through them. It\\'s funny, touching at times, well written and intelligent. They make lots of references to movies, TV shows, celebrities, so if you don\\'t watch a lot of movies and television, you may have some trouble understanding everything. It\\'s refreshing to see a gay character who\\'s not a drama queen, typical type of gay guy you see on TV. Adam Pally, who plays the gay character, is awesome and my favorite. It\\'s also so refreshing to see an interracial couple (black and white), that openly make jokes about their differences. The only thing I don\\'t really like about this show, is Elisha Cuthbert. Although I like her and I think she is so pretty, I don\\'t think she plays her character well. I feel like she can\\'t find her place with the others and she doesn\\'t really fit, like she\\'s missing something. A lot of times, I just find her awkward. But that\\'s just my opinion. I\\'ll still watch the show. Maybe she\\'ll get better with time. So overall, I think it\\'s a super cool show. And please do not compare this series with Friends, this has nothing to do with it. It\\'s too easy to say they are friends and do stuff together, and compare characters. It\\'s so much more than that. I never really liked Friends and I love this show. They can\\'t re-invent the wheel. We all have friends, a lot of them resemble others, it\\'s based on real life that\\'s it. I really recommend everyone to at least watch season 1 :) Then you can judge by yourself :) I have no faith in any new shows anymore, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched Happy Endings. I get concerned when a new show gets slotted in between the hottest most popular shows. But I was hooked right away. There is definitely great chemistry amongst all cast members. The jokes are well written and the timing is well done. One area of concern is what\\'s in store for the couple that fell apart at the altar - I am not sure how they will handle their relationship, but so far so good. They take risks, but they pay off. The result is sweet and funny and engaging. I think it will get even better with time. I am definitely continuing to watch it! I was recently introduced to this show by a friend and was left wondering why I\\'ve never watched it before. It\\'s AWESOME! As a Chicagoan, the setting has an authentic feel and while I do recognize the Friends-esque setting, the characters are refreshing to me.My favorites are Jane, Brad and Penny and, frankly, I could happily watch a show about those three alone. I love Jane (Eliza Coupe) and Brad\\'s (Damon Wayans, Jr.) relationship - they are hilarious individually, but there\\'s something magical about them together. They are amazingly kooky and have their own relationship shorthand, which is endearing. I can relate to Penny (Casey Wilson) on so many levels - she\\'s just trying to get it right and she\\'s so optimistic, even when everything goes wrong.Max, Alex and Dave are good, too, but they don\\'t pop for me the way the other three do. I do love that they didn\\'t go obvious and flamboyant with Max. All six together do have a wonderful rapport.Great show - I hope it\\'s around a long time! I\\'ve just read they\\'ve cancelled this which is depressing news.It\\'s funny, well acted, great timing, lots of surreal left turns. It\\'s just brilliant and *inspired* comedy. Even when it gets ridiculous, they don\\'t break character, which makes it all the funnier. It doesn\\'t MATTER that there\\'s no overriding story arc as each episode stands alone, and each is funny. I don\\'t see it at all as like a Friends rip off, it\\'s far too leftfield, the only similarity with Friends is it\\'s got a group of people who know each other in it.Yet you\\'ve poorly scripted and acted forgettable stuff with awful timing that\\'s basically a sequence of bad slapstick and double entendres (see \"two broke girls\") and that\\'s renewed? HIMYM which lost its way a while back and has another season to go? What sort of world do I live in?! :(Please some other network pick this up, it\\'s ah-ma-zing :) IF you\\'re over 30 you might not like this show. It\\'s the typical fare Hollywood is rehashing over and over, but this time it\\'s \"modernizing\" with an interracial couple (but STILL the same tired African American man with the Blonde white girl), one sided jokes and 80s sitcom no-real-story-just-people-hanging-out episodes, each pretty much like the last. What makes the shows before it click with an audience is because they are funny, non politically bent with characters that can be individual from the others. Happy Ending has none of this and feels forced and fake. BUT the teenagers think it\\'s great (but then again they think MTV is how the real world works) and it\\'s just modern-hip enough for pretend hipsters to smugly say \"Oh yes, it\\'s far beyond The Middle and Modern Family humor. It\\'s cool.\" There ya go. Hopefully, like the other shows before it this sorta rips off, this one too will vanish. I still don\\'t understand...this show is absolutely hysterical and so entertaining. Thankfully it\\'s on Hulu now so I can still watch when I want. BRING IT BACK!! Even if it\\'s just for one episode/reunion...that would be \"amahzing\". I\\'ve had high hopes for this one. I adore Elisha Cuthbert, and I was so excited that she\\'s returning to TV...But come on... It\\'s 2011, for g*d\\'s sake. Shows like \"Modern Family\", \"Cougar Town\", and \"The Middle\" are on the air on ABC, to name only the single-camera comedies that \"Happy Endings\" is joining there. Not to mention the competition - \"Community\", \"Traffic Light\" - both shockingly well written comedies. It\\'s like a rotten apple in an otherwise flawless bowl of fruit.I really don\\'t want to be the jerk here, but I honestly don\\'t understand, why this show got 8.0 points here on IMDb. Yeah, the cast is good looking (Hollywood, d\\'oh) and they are generally decent actors (Hollywood, d\\'oh, pt. 2) but the characters are... well, they almost don\\'t even exist. It\\'s just a bunch of mediocre professionals, fooling around in front of a camera, without any pronounced reason, or goal whatsoever. It\\'s not the kind of stumbling around when taking the very first steps... something\\'s very wrong, that\\'s seated deeper than that.I\\'ve watched each and every pilot in the past 6 or 7 TV seasons (network or cable, everything), and there were many occasions, when I had felt like: \\'OK this was pretty bad, but I can feel it will take off, and get much better\\'. With \"Happy Endings\", I have no such feeling at all. There are just too many things that are wrong about this one. The characters that are supposed to be funny (or funnier than the others) are just not, the lines, and plots are not funny enough or at all, the ones that come through after all, are so clichéd, that if I had a penny each time I\\'ve heard of seen them, I\\'d be rich.I have a very bad feeling about a pilot, when after watching it I can\\'t remember the characters\\' names. It\\'s a dead-on indicator, that the show is badly written. Another \\'tell\\' is when I\\'m confused about who is really the lead character, or \\'hero\\' if you will, but it\\'s quite silly to talk about heroes since it\\'s (supposedly) a comedy.James Burrows had said in an interview once, that it\\'s very easy to tell if a comedy is well written - or if it works or not: don\\'t look at the screen, only listen to the dialogue, as if it was a radio play. It has to work, even then. And damn it, it\\'s true: try it, with \"Friends\", \"Cheers\", \"That 70\\'s Show\", I could go on. It works. With \"Happy Endings\", it does not, even if you look at the screen it doesn\\'t.But at least Elisha is beautiful. That\\'s not enough to save the show, in my opinion. I watched one episode to kill time and feel in love instantly. Rarely I actually laugh out loud when I\\'m alone, every time I reply the episodes I still do. Each character you will fall in love with and is hilarious. I gave it a well deserved 10 out of 10 and will recommend it to everyone i know. The shows characters covers all demographics of the black guy the hot girl the funny football watching, beer drinking gay guy and so on. The style is great on the show with a lot of twisted humor which is awesome. And it has the hot girl from the girl next door and Damon Waynes son. Emediatly after reading this go watch it, and there\\'s a lot of hot girls on the show. I love this show. Its fresh, borderline-crazy, and its only the first season! If more people hear about this show, it will be undoubtedly a show that everyone will be watching and talking about the next morning. I currently love to watch Modern Family and this show ranks up there. Its a different setting/scenario but how it makes me laugh is the same...HARD! The characters/actors seem so individually talented that the show can probably run LIVE with ad-libs. Kudos to the writers and actors in this so far. I eagerly await each episode. I really hope that they give this show a chance to get the exposure for people to hop on board. I kinda feel good that I am an early adopter to the show, but I tell everyone that I meet, that its a must-see! It has been a long time since I found any sitcom hilarious since FRIENDS, thank God for Modern Family now I have something to watch on, but is it enough?No way! And imagine how delighted I was when I watched Happy Endings pilot. It\\'s unique, funny and you can relate to all the characters. Personally, I love all of them but if I have to choose it would be Max and Penny; Max is charming, sassy and a slacker which add more points to him, and Penny? she reminds me of Phoebe Buffay but in less weird world. I think I speak for every guy when I say that we watch this series cause of Elisha Cuthbert, though ironically her character is flat (gradually changing in second season), of course she is pretty to look at, but have you see her on-screen sister? Eliza Coupe is mamacita sexy! My favorite episode from Season 1 would be \\'Mein coming out\\' and \\'The shershow redemption\\', both brilliantly written and has its own warm that will surely bring smile to every viewers. Recommended! Same as the other\\'s really. I adore Elisha Cuthbert, but I\\'m also a big SNL fan, so Casey Wilson was an added bonus. But I DVR\\'d it and gave it a shot and I\\'ll be coming back for more. The episode where Adam Pally\\'s character is too scared to come out to his parents, so Jayne plays his \"Beard\" was great. Fast Forward to Jazz Kwon Do and I think ABC found themselves a winner. Listen, its nothing like \"Friends\" other than 3 males and 3 Females. That crappy show that NBC just axed, \"Perfect Couples\" was more like it than this. I would certainly say its more like \"How I Met Your Mother,\" meets \"Cougar Town\". 2 more shows that have great writing and built some decent back stories for their characters. Needless to say, I\\'ll keep watching and hope that ABC doesn\\'t squash it too early. I watched almost a whole episode of this second rate Friends (which I also couldn\\'t stand) show. Is this what passes for comedy? Inauthentic, unfunny banter between young fairly good looking actors who try to act cool and hip. I can\\'t believe people like this show. Isn\\'t the point of a sitcom to make you laugh? I sat through 3/4 of tonight\\'s episode and could only shake my head. Do yourself a favour and watch a show that is actually funny like Parks & Recreation. The actors are not hot, they\\'re funny. Strange concept for a sitcom, eh? I would rather watch a marathon of that new Adam Sandler movie where he plays his own twin sister. Yes, it\\'s that bad. I Love Comedy, I HATE lame.The long review.There is nothing less than lame here. How much more unthoughtful well unwritten schlock can you get away with and call it \"comedy\". It not\\'s exclusive to the usual \"I like chewing gum for the mind\" set that can get along with a few words and an accompanied laugh track but this really takes the cookie. Not for any other reason than the following. 1. Why would you want to watch and waste you time with this show? 2. There must be something else on? 3. ABC have produced much better shows, why did they think this would be a hit?The short review.In a nation that put a man on the moon why can\\'t we learn how to make a funny show without saying that it is funny when it\\'s not. For example Family Guy = Funny (not to be biased but it\\'s not for everyone) The Golden Girls = Funny Roseanne = Funny 3rd Rock from the Sun = Funny Home Improvement = Funny Sitcoms aren\\'t funny unless they can be laughed at without a canned laugh track.The following above are just examples and not funny for everyone but are widely viewed and repeated. Happy Endings will probably not be repeated Thank God< Includes all beliefs but we\\'re One nation, let\\'s laugh at something funny together for once! It\\'s simple as ABC. Seriously cannot understand why anyone would like this show. It is the worst thing I think I have ever seen. It is not funny in any way and the characters are so annoying. Worst set of actors I\\'ve seen, they over act each scene and it is basically just insulting to the audience\\'s intelligence. There is absolutely no wit or thought behind the writing, I literally wanted to scratch my eyes out it is that bad. Please stop making this show and showing me commercials, even those brief looks into what is coming up on the show is too hard for me to stomach watching. So tired of comedy shows like this that basically come up with the cheesiest jokes and actors they can find. Horrible, don\\'t watch.Also, please stop comparing this ridiculous show with modern family, not even in the same category at all because this show sucks! I tried to love this show, I couldn\\'t. It hovers on the edge of two faces: annoying and potential.Elisha Cuthbert is attractive, funny, and compelling. Her character is believable and well written. +1 Zachary Knighton is a good match for Elisha but not a compelling lead. I can\\'t say if it\\'s the actor or the writers, but somethings missing. And from what I\\'ve seen from Knighton elsewhere he\\'s not the problem. Maybe this just isn\\'t his role? 0 (Writers need to make him more cocky with quick one liners.) Eliza Coupe while sometimes her role is funny, it is so often annoying it\\'s painful. -1 Adam Pally is the only reason to watch this show. He\\'s hilarious. He lands his lines and sells his charm. He owns the role. But he\\'s gay, and that really limits his story line. The whole show already has TOO much of a gay feel. =0 Damon Wayan Jr. is awesome. Just not in here. =0 Casey Wilson an amazing actress and comedian, just blows. She\\'s so annoying on Happy Endings that sometimes she literally has me standing up and turning off the TV walking out the back door and shooting myself. -2Happy Endings had such potential. But it ended up being about annoying people. You just don\\'t walk away loving the characters. It\\'s a highly polarizing show, but as a comedy show, it\\'s brilliant. If you want laughs, this is where to go.I\\'ve read all the reviews here and people have been rating it poorly due to a weak pilot (I\\'ll admit it was weak), cliché characters (they are) and lack of story arc/character development.This is a comedy, not a light drama. I watch it to laugh, not to see characters develop and romances blossom. This show is similar to How I Met Your Mother\\'s earlier seasons, how it should\\'ve been before it became a lame love story. In some ways, it is similar to Seinfeld (also no character development) or It\\'s Always Sunny in Philadelphia (also no character development) - they\\'re shows to watch and laugh. Not for light dramas, cute events and \"aww\" moments.Every episode is a throwaway episode in that it can be watched in any order, the story is irrelevant in the big picture and it\\'s just a mechanism for delivering laughs.Ultimately, it\\'s a comedy, it sets itself out to be a comedy, says it\\'s a comedy and it does a great job at making people laugh. Rating it poorly for not having enough drama or character development is missing the point. It\\'s supposed to make you laugh, not cheer you up.The jokes are really funny. They are witty, sometimes word-based and sometimes situational, there\\'s flashbacks (Family Guy style), camera tricks, observational, references to other films and more. There is very little slapstick, people tripping, falling and so on.It\\'s not for everyone. If you want slapstick, drama and \"aww\" moments - you\\'ve come to the wrong place. If you want laughs, this show does it best. I would say this show deserves more than it\\'s current rating. I see folks bash it but after watching more than 1 episode ( most bad reviews watched the pilot and crucified it ) I can say this can have a future. It\\'s well done the acting is good enough the cases are interesting and the whole military guys coming to the be a doctor at a hospital in a night shift is pretty interesting.I would say, give the show a chance it can grow on you. I know the market is a bit saturated and over the whole medical drama theme. Now if you are completely over medical stuff then there is no convincing anybody.I myself am never over good shows and this seems to be a good show. I ve watched till episode 5 and it\\'s getting better and better. Show was pretty decent for season 1/2, did some things differently then the standard ER show and did them well. Season 3 had some issues but wasn\\'t all that bad. Season 4 is just a mess. It\\'s hitting all the negative tropes of an ER show, the story itself is all over the place and the \"big event\" for many of the episodes are just ludicrous. Sorry to see the series end on such a sour note. I hope this runs longer than one season. I found it charming and uplifting that there could ever be a place where people meant more than the bottom line.The characters seemed to fit.The heart was in the place with each doctor nurse and staff. Maybe it is too much for some just coming back from duty,but I liked it. I will be tuning in each week to see what happens. I would class it in line with N.C.I.S and hope it stays around. I wish more shows were of the drama involved here.Inspired. Tragic brings hope without terror.Keep up the good work.The facts are that they don\\'t take entertainment serious anymore. Casting works in this case the seem to fit just right. I watched a couple of episodes before I turned it off forever. It is the worst depiction of ER life I have ever seen. It is more like a video game than a show. It should be a soap opera not a evening TV show.The characters all have unbelievable back-stories.They are all clichéd.They apparently don\\'t have a medical consultant, as the medical care is laughable. They apparently don\\'t have a medical ethicist either. Every time they get to the crossroads of a moral dilemma, they take the wrong turn.In case nobody told them, you can\\'t cross-match and do heart surgery with ER docs in the O.R. If an ER doc went to the O.R. he\\'d be laughed out of the room. Oh, writers for this series here\\'s a clue: resuscitated people usually stay on a ventilator for a while and have IV\\'s and stuff. People that sick, look, well, that sick. There is no social worker on the team, I guess that\\'s a blessing as whatever stereotype of us exists would be through the roof. But they do have a full-time psychiatrist, ON THE NIGHT SHIFT! It was rare to ever see a psychiatrist in the ER let alone have one live there. Oh yeah. If we did have one I doubt she\\'d be boinking the narcissistic ER doc in the store room.I could go on and on but won\\'t. Check it out for yourself. Being a surgeon myself i watched two episodes (first two). I cannot believe my eyes! I know for cinematic purposes medical procedures are a little different from real world. But when you do open chest surgery in the ER, with no masks!!! What are the directors trying to portray here? Drama and coolness abounds but glaring falsity in treating patients must not be twisted. wrong wrong wrong. At least HouseMD and Greys anatomy do not distort the medical procedures (sterility etc). They need a medical adviser to make this better. The first episode with the doctor doing auto transfusion without filtering is again a misnomer with what we really do. I will not go to this hospital ever. This show is terrible, but on a level where its almost playing on all the cliches that make network tv so bad. Which is why i love this show. \\nIt feels intentional by the producers, eerily similar to 90210, Party of 5, and Dawson\\'s Creek of 20 years ago. Random slow motion scenes, ridiculous explanations for what caused the patients trauma, way over dramatized ER power struggles out of no where, wierd sexual tension, the stereotypes are perfect and extremely unrealistic, problems are solved out of no where throught an episode, and relationship paralyzing issues over the most random things. The acting is so on point, just like one of Christopher Guest\\'s infamous mockumentaries.If you despise network programming between the hours of 7-10 pm Monday-Friday, there is a good chance you will love this show. For those who miss the daytime soap operas, this should be your cup of tea. Everyone at this hospital bickers with each other, patients never die (well, they do die, but the staff performs miracles and brings them back to life) and doctors and nurses are constantly hopping into bed with each other. And if you tire of the hospital surroundings, you can enjoy the same ridiculous plots that take place in Syria. The stories are all embarrassing and beyond belief and the acting is worse. Case in point is Scott Wolf. I am not too familiar with him, but I know he\\'s been around for decades. If all his work is similar to the character he portrays here, it is a mystery to me how he continues to get acting jobs. His grimaces, bug eyes, and gestures are laughable. He treats every line like he is reciting Shakespeare. When he\\'s on camera I just cringe! The only mystery bigger than how he gets acting jobs is why so many people think this is a good show. I don\\'t normally write actual reviews on here but I thought this was necessary after seeing some of the bad reviews! This show is great, from the action, to the characters and the relationships between characters it\\'s a show that I find really enjoyable! If you love dramas with action and a bit of comedy to keep things interesting then you will absolutely love The Night Shift... Ignore the negative reviews on here The Night Shift is awesome and really enjoyable, a definite 10/10 I hope it runs for a lot longer can\\'t wait to see what happens next I have to start off by saying that I am not usually a fan of medical drama shows. I was never interested in ER, Grey\\'s Anatomy, Scrubs, or any of the other shows of this kind. This one, however, I like.I first watched the show because it stars Eoin Macken. I loved his light-hearted, somewhat goofy portrayal of Sir Gawain in the BBC show \"Merlin\", so I thought I\\'d see what he could do with this role. I\\'m very impressed with his work on this show, which seems to improve with every episode. His breakdown scene after his friend Topher is shot,triggering overpowering flashbacks to his time at war, is heart-breaking. The fact that he may be the most perfectly gorgeous man who ever lived is just a bonus.The show centres around a group of army doctors who now work on the night shift at a hospital in San Antonio. Macken plays T.C. Callahan, a doctor who is suffering from PTSD, though it is never specifically stated. The cast is lively and interesting. It includes Callahan\\'s ex- girlfriend, Jordan, as the acting chief of staff for the night shift, and a secretly gay army doctor who does MMA fighting on the side. There are also two interns, one who is capable, cool, fun, and fits right in, and the other who is \"book smart\" but naive. There is a hospital administrator who seems like a real stick in the mud, a psychiatrist who is having a sexual fling with T.C., and Jordan\\'s current boyfriend who joins the hospital as a trauma surgeon.With all of these colourful characters, there are endless story lines. There are always sub-plots alongside the main action, and everything blends together seamlessly. I have to admit that I found the first episode clumsy, as there was limited time to introduce so many characters, but after that, the show really took off.The action in each episode is non-stop. Being army doctors, these guys often fly out to do triage at a chemical explosion, or airlift a shooting victim from a remote hunting accident. Do I think this is a realistic portrayal of an average doctor\\'s shift at work? No. Is it dramatic, exciting, fast-paced, and fun? Hell, yeah.Although the plot changes each episode, it always furthers the personal story line of the characters. Each of them faces insecurity, doubt, jealousy, fear, joy, victory, and loneliness. There is a strong emphasis on camaraderie, sticking together through thick and thin, and helping each other. There is the occasional make-out session in a storage closet, pranks played on their new intern, and even a male nurse helping the boss write a dating site profile, all of which lighten the mood from time to time.Sometimes the patients die on this show. Sometimes the doctors make mistakes or have a melt down. It just adds to the drama, as outcomes are unpredictable. This is the kind of show that you allow yourself to enter, rather than sit back and observe. While it\\'s not demanding to watch, it is intense most of the time. I\\'ve shed a tear in many episodes. I find it quite funny how the general public of today can\\'t give credit where it\\'s due. This show, any show at that is geared for entertainment purposes and that\\'s that.I find \"The Night Shift\" entertaining, well acted, thought provoking and greatly paced. Just because what unfolds during \"The Night Shift\" may not follow protocol of an actual E.R. that doesn\\'t mean it should take away from the show,IT\\'S A SHOW FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES. If you don\\'t find this entertaining go stare at a rock. You also have to realize, this show brought plenty of people work for an extended amount of time. I happen to be personal friends with one of the main, lead actors. I spent quite a bit of time on set and the effort put forth for this show to become a success was immense! Everyone worked their tails off, everyone took pride and the local economy/workers prospered greatly. If a show, as this one can boost a local economy (like ABQ, where filmed) then fantastic. Also, for all the under qualified naysayers of this show, tune in next season for season 2 of \"The Night Shift.\" Enjoy tonight\\'s episode! This show has very strange politics.The emergency room is having a hard time staying open because of \"cut backs and Obamacare\" is this fictional Texas hospital.But the poor infant can\\'t have dialysis because of no insurance. (Had Texas increased medicaid coverage as offered by Obamacare,the child would be covered.) The hospital janitor\\'s daughter can\\'t get a scan of the lump on her abdomen because of no insurance. (But if she\\'s under 26 years old, she\\'s covered under her father\\'s policy under Obamacare.) The hot Doctor\\'s medical education was paid 100% by the U.S. Government because he was in the army at the time. I\\'m confused. Is the message: The government should have universal health insurance coverage and pay for the education of our doctors...even in the state of Texas?That said... The characters are no strangers to medical dramas. There is the tough administrator who may have a heart of gold; the second in command who is smart, very good looking and compassionate; the macho closeted gay doctor, the nurse who... well, you get the idea. It\\'s been done before in countless number of medical show that barely made it to 13 episodes. Still, if you like that sort of show (and I do), it\\'s worth a watch. I look forward to viewing the summer shows but Night Shift is the BEST new show I have seen in years. I hope the NBC has the good sense to bring it back for a full season!!! The characters are rich and well developed. The plot lines are excellent and the writing is superb. Having worked the night shift in a hospital years ago I can appreciate the various trials the staff has to endure such as shortage of staff, equipment, etc, but even to the layman this show has everything to offer with the story lines, suspense, a little romance, the hesitation of new doctors trying to care for their patient\\'s with as much expertise as their limited experience allows and glimpses into the past of some of the doctors that contribute to the people they are currently. This new series hit the ground running with adrenaline-charged action/Emergency room trauma from 15 seconds into it at a level equivalent to a blockbuster action movie. (I won\\'t reference the army-field procedure in the forest in the first few minutes but it will knock your socks off!) The Night Shift kept the heart-pounding adrenaline up throughout the entire first season! I am enthralled and in love with this series. Great writing, great dialog/sarcasm/character development/ camera/story. This is a SMART SHOW. Any poor reviewers of this show are clearly under- educated. I feel sorry for those folks who left a negative review and obviously hate everything and the people bother to read their negativity. NBC TAKE NOTE! THIS SHOW IS DEVOURED APPRECIATIVELY!! THANK YOU!!! PLEASE RENEW SEASONS 2, [3, 4, 5, AND 6-10\\x85\\x85 ] I haven\\'t been sparked to watch a medical drama (one of my favorite genres since I am a Doctor) since ER. The Night Shift blows Grey\\'s Anatomy out of the water!! Grey\\'s anatomy is a soap opera with a little medicine thrown in for garnish. The Night Shift, thankfully, is centered around original creative trauma scenes with serious medical maiming that the cast has to handle on their own via diagnosis, treatment and surgery, in the same way real overnight ER doctors would in one hospital that serves a lot of military staff. Excellent acting. Brilliant story lines. KEEP IT COMING!!! THANK YOU!! I usually give new series a three episode window. I stopped recording after two. It\\'s just bad. Forget the fact that they have doctors performing heart transplants without doing tissue matching tests, doing field surgery, and hitting each other. The stereotypes of veterans, blacks, Latinos, nurses, doctors are abundant and insulting. The characters are tropes as are the situations. The troubled veteran, fighting for justice while recovering from PTSD. Give me a break. It\\'s insulting to doctors, veterans, and people with PTSD.The writing is manipulative. The druggie who threw himself off the roof miraculously recovers so that the decorated vet can\\'t have his heart and then dies. Oh, the irony! I can only imagine the damage this second episode did to organ donation programs after the parents were virtually strong armed into donating their son\\'s heart. Don\\'t waste your time on this one. I watched the first episode and thought this can only get better, give it another chance. Episode 2, how wrong can one be, it actually got worse and I finally turned it off after 20 minutes. A definite no go. The acting is only as bad as the script makes it. There are a couple of good actors in this show who should be doing better work. Wonder sometimes whether they really read the script or they get talked into things. I can really claim I have been watching TV for around 55 years and have seen good things be canceled and bad things stay for a long run. Maybe they will manage to make this better but they will have lost so many viewers by then it may be too late. I\\'m gone. You just know this show is not going to be realistic in any form right from the first minutes of the pilot episode. (SMALL SPOILER) Who seriously gets released from jail, hops on their motorbike, performs a lifesaving operation along the way (successfully) and then gets into work and swaps their bloody shirt for a scrubs top. Seriously where was the shower!!! (SPOILER OVER)I decided to instead judge this show on how it obviously wanted to be portrayed. A dramatic action comedy that just happens to centre around a bunch of doctors working the night shift. After coming to terms with this fact and actually watching more than one episode, I have come to the conclusion that this show is not too bad. It has some interesting cases and while the cast are ridiculous they are what draws you into the show. They feel like normal people who just go through extraordinary things.If you are watching this because you like medical shows like Grey\\'s Anatomy & ER then give it a miss. But if you just love watching over-the-top action dramas then you may really enjoy this show. This show is supposed to be set in San Antonio, but looks nothing like it. San Antonio has no mountains and is not in a desert. Looks more like a rural backwater than a large city. I doubt the writers have been to San Antonio or Texas.The plot has a patient who needs a neurosurgeon, but the only one is finishing a surgery in Houston (which the writers obviously don\\'t realize is 200 miles away). San Antonio has no neurosurgeon? Really? A city of 1.3 million people? I could overlook the sizable factual flaws if the characters weren\\'t so one one dimensional, bland and predictable. The plot does nothing to grab your interest. No humor. No suspense. Just boring.Texas is such an interesting place. Diverse cultures, a nice variety of natural disasters, hospitals that deal with urban problems and transfers from far flung rural areas and \"Perrycare\" all could have provided interesting story lines. But no, the writers stick to the already overdone stereotypes. What a waste. Seriously, this show is terrible. Looks like a bad takeoff of Grays Anatomy and ER combined. A MacDreamy look-alike, a Meredith character, a naive intern straight out of ER, the wise counsel of the calm Dry. Green...seriously? Do television execs think we the audience are that gullible? Had trouble following the dialog, the pacing was chaotic at times of high drama. The storyline was too far fetched to be believable - a child with multiple and violent personalities.acting stiff and forced, bedside scene with dying hero so contrived. I am sure the actors in this show can do much better...writers and director to blame. I am done, shutting it off, never to return. Yes, this show is both unbelievable and stupid. It is as though its writers randomly took a handful of clichés out of The Hollywood Not So Big Bag of Clichés and threw them together in hopes that somehow they would create a watchable show. Well, they don\\'t.It is just another unbearably pompous and self-important -- and because (or is it despite?) of that completely unconvincing -- network TV disaster, of which there are plenty, where the characters look and sound as if they stepped right off the modeling runway, with acting skills to match their original occupation. It does not escape anyone\\'s attention -- because how could it? -- that in addition to stunning good looks, the average age of this \"ER\" staff is 22. OK, maybe 22 and a half. They must all be graduates of the Doogie Howser medical on-line program ($19.95 + $5 for a diploma). And they act it, too.A bunch of high school students putting on a play for parents would probably do a better job than this cast; although, to be fair, the dismally hackneyed writing is mostly to blame. If you want to waste your time on another predictable so-called medical drama where the glamorous doctors\\' main preoccupation is who\\'s shtupping whom, then this new(ish) NBC fiasco is for you. Otherwise don\\'t bother.P.S. Not so confidential to the show\\'s writers (after the 3/16/15 episode): Immaculate conception does not mean what you think it means. (And that\\'s one of the less jarring missteps. Eh.) Awesome series. Its heart throbbing, action and comedy all in one! Certainly a great series, its the ultimate best, it shows emphasis on real people and how their work life\\'s contribute to their professional life in the med field, it shows you also how passionate people are about saving lives and the behind the scenes of how real doctors and nurses lives are. The casting crew is amazing... its like they characters are like family members they love and care for irrespective of caste or creed. The comedy is good and the fact that their saving life makes your heart skips a beat with the intense scenes, i seriously enjoyed it and recommend to all. Its addictive, hope there\\'s more seasons to come of this amazing series... I honestly could not believe how bad this was. It looks cheaply made. The acting was like watching acting students who knew they were being filmed. Now I know some of these actors have been successful in other things. So I have to blame the writers and the show itself. It feels like a jumble of 100 other medical \"dramas\" with the all the parts that do not work. I watch stuff like this to fall asleep to but I found myself waking up with annoyance at how bad it was. This is the medical version of \"Friends with Better Lives\", which I felt the same way about after one episode. I said that is getting canceled STAT. And it was. This will never make it. They will burn it off for summer and it will be done. There is nothing worth watching on this show. This show had all the pieces to be something great, but it is sadly more of a let down then anything else. You easily fall in love with some of the characters like Brendan Fehr and his portrayal of Dr. Alister, Ken Leung as Dr Topher, JR Lemon as Nurse Kenny and Freddy Rodriguez playing Michael Rogosa as the hard arse that you grow to love. However through out a show that is meant to capture humanity in some of it\\'s most vulnerable times and deal with current issues across a wide spectrum, the writing is weak and unfulfilling. You have main cast member shave tumours in one episode and then they have survived what few do without any screen time of this. You have a character that is struggling to be openly gay and where this is an occurring theme, after his partner loses his leg and a small break up they run off to get married (which again we don\\'t see) Another main characters is written off by an email being sent to the staff to say he died in a car accident, after being on the show for 3 season and guess what the next episode is a month later, where the whole team have healed from this tragic passing. The afore mentioned gay couple try to adopt a kid when the real dad turns up out of the blue with about 5 mins screen, of course wanting to stop them and by the end of one episode this is all resolved and they take there daughter home. It just feels like lazy writing and no interest in actually exploring things in depth, which is a shame because they had some good examples of storylines. Such a disappointment all and all, where there is short lived problems and miraculous diagnosis. A rather weak start with the morals of the characters. They seem to believe that what they feel is best is what they should do regardless of the patient\\'s wishes. Some things include cutting off medical bracelets and disregarding DNR or sedating another person in order to obtain their blood for donation.Another user said it best when they described this as similar to Grey\\'s Anatomy as there is a McDreamy & Meredith. Other things that can be considered annoying is the two female brunettes Jordan & Krista. Since they are on the same team they wear the same colour clothes, similar long brown hair so it can be difficult to determine which is which until you get used to the two of them (it would have been better to put in a blonde or a redhead instead. Having being deployed twice as a hospital corpsman with the marines and working in the E.R and ICU, I can tell you this show is bunk. No ER doctor is going perform surgery. They may place chest tubes, perform thoracentesis and cricothyrotomies.Medical doctors in an active combat roll? No! Not going to happen. They aren\\'t going out of the wire let alone drive a humvee or engage in combat.Doctor\\'s as part of a medvac team? Again not going to happen. Did the writers and producers of the show just pull what the thought how an E.R operated out of their ass? I know it\\'s \"entertainment\" but don\\'t insult people\\'s intelligence. I\\'m not surprised by the news of \"The Night Shift\" being canceled. I have been a loyal fan of \"The Night Shift,\" but in the fourth season, the series really lost touch with its roots. The fourth season started out just okay, but by their fourth episode, it started going downhill. The show seemed it faced a bit of an identity crisis, as it couldn\\'t decide whether or not it was military medicine or work back at home at Texas San Antonio night shift. I think the series peaked in its third season. Season three was near perfect, but the show\\'s fourth season had too much going on (as I said, come the fourth episode and that point on). \"The Night Shift\" always had the issue of balancing military-based stories and work at S.A.M., but it became much more obvious in the show\\'s fourth season. I think part of it might have been sending T.C. back to Syria, while also introducing the new nurse (played by Mark Consuelos), while also following T.C.\\'s new love interest of the year (cue the eye roll). It got to be too much. If the series stayed in touch with it roots through season four and then got cancelled, I\\'d be upset; however, that just wasn\\'t the case. I won\\'t miss \"The Night Shift.\" Not to mention most of us won\\'t, as the ratings don\\'t lie.The show\\'s first season was just average. The second season was an improvement. The third was great. And then it fell apart. I am sorry to say the showrunners and writers brought this on themselves. Going all over the place and ruining the core focus doomed a once good show. Had they continued along the paths of seasons two and three, they just might have made it to their fifth season.After season one, I gave \"The Night Shift\" a 7.2/10. After season two, I gave it a 7.6/10. After the third season, I gave it an 8.1/10. If it was not for season four, I would probably give this show a solid 8.0, but it happened and I really dreaded the show\\'s fourth season. I am now only convinced that all that goodness was for nothing. I give it a 1.0/10. I am really sorry to say this but it would have been best if the series ended in its third season. It would have ended on a major cliffhanger but on a really high note!'],\n",

I\\'m willing to suspend my disbelief, put up with bad writing and gaping plot holes, listen to rabid and thinly-disguised moral or political agendum, even see some of my heroes fall. But suddenly the whole ST universe is dark, and the future is no longer hopeful. Is the world really that way? Sure. But that was the appeal of this alternate universe- its overall message was, \"things will eventually be... okay.\"\\nIf you guys want to make an edgy, dark sci-fi drama, fine. But make your own show- don\\'t ruin Star Trek to do it. I am at the moment watching fifth episode. I was forcing myself to watch all these episodes expecting it might get better, but honestly I am disappointed and angry because it is boring, not star Trek, and dragging as if they plan to have 2 thousands episodes. ... after 3 episodes I just can\\'t take it any longer. What a mess, this isn\\'t Star Trek. I don\\'t know what this is but it isn\\'t Star Trek.\\nUPDATE March 6th 2020\\nAfter forcing myself to watch further episodes I\\'ve now reduced my rating from 2 stars down to 1 and I really wish I could give it a Zero. I thought Discovery was bad but this rubbish makes Discovery shine. Up to episode 5 . All that has gone could have been done In one episode. Ridiculous fight scenes involving Patrick Stewart who is too old to be part of them scenes and a ridiculously french accent in ep 5. Just dull and a stretched series. I struggled through the first 4 episodes hoping it was going to get better it never really did, but the final straw came at the start of episode 5. I mean the unneeded over the top gore and violence I thought was well completely off putting, so much so I stopped watching the movie. Why on earth they need to put violent gory scenes like that in Star Trek as well as the multiple F-bombs make no sense to me. The plot is slow and boring, the characters are dull and you don\\'t really care about them, you just wish they were like they were in TNG, but they are no where near as likeable, and the unneeded gory violence and swearing is completely off putting. So just like Discovery Picard is getting thrown into the trash for me. CBS has totally destroyed this franchise and The Orville is the only current place to watch a real star-trek like show. There some real funny business going on here with this list show\\'s rating being 8.2 (at the time of this writing). Not only is it so obvious that this show is terrible, a look at the reviews shows mostly 1\\'s, 2\\'s, and 3\\'s. How does it average an 8.2?\\nFake News The only thing this has in common with STNG is character names. It\\'s just another action show that has ditched everything that was good about it\\'s predecessor. While some are falling over themselves slobbering this show with praise, I, a fan since 1966, will not. Trek started to go downhill with the rushed into production, Voyager, continued the tailspin with the tepid Enterprise, hit a terrible bumpy road with the mostly unwatchable Kelvin films, and is now being destroyed by this fool Kurtzman. Discovery, with it\\'s dark, crappy storyline as well as a non existent sister for Spock, one of the dumbest ideas in the history of Star Trek, and another unnecessary prequel, we have the boring Picard. CBS is in this just for the money, while Kurtzman seems to think his foolish ideas and ignoring of Star Trek history make his stuff great. Wrong. The lens flare, the cursing, making the Romulans this honorable people - stolen from the Klingons - making the federation a bitter alliance who turn their back on the Romulans. Picard is the only one left with a conscience? Ridiculous. As for bringing back Picard, why is CBS so afraid to do something truly new? An entire new cast. Go into the future rather than making prequels, reboots and retreads? Bring in a guy like Manny Coto, who saved the 4th season of Enterprise and fire Kurtzman. He\\'s the Zack Snyder of Star Trek. Bring back a direction for the franchise and point it into the future where it belongs. What is it trying to do, why imitate star trek/mandolorian when the franchise had so much good to borrow from. Obnoxious music and unnecessary backstory when did capitan picard fell on his head. No cohesion in story and worst direction. More like a haphazardly edited movie trailer then a series. The first episode had me interested for a bit then it just went into the toilet and every episode since has left me completely disappointed and more and more disinterested. There are a few special effects scenes that look amazing but that\\'s it. And that\\'s not nearly enough to make me watch any further. The writers and producers of this farce need to be canned. While it was pretty clear the episodic Star Trek tales are unlikely to come back - and they didn\\'t need to, given Picard\\'s age - this series is an utter disppointment and wasted opportunity.I\\'m through half of season 1 and not much has happened yet, there is no story arch worth mentioning and characters appear flat (and if you have ever watched ST:TNG, everyone is out of character anyway).It\\'s probably the worst written series since Nightflyers, where nothing makes any sense if you spend a few seconds thinking about it.If you enjoy Science Fiction, watch \"The Expanse\" and compare the first five episodes to ST:P - The writers there managed to establish a whole new universe, background story, characters we care about and most important a stroy arch we are excited to follow!ST:P is neither Star Trek nor SciFi. It\\'s some uninteresting drama series in some fantasy setting, not worth watching. I grew up watching Star Trek and have become an engineer because of its inspiration. However, this show doesn\\'t inspire me, there\\'s violence, strong language, and a confusing story line.\\nOn the other hand, they are ruining beloved characters such as Seven of Nine as it seems she is a murderer now, far from the character we remember from Voyager. Having been a Star Trek fan for decades, was so hopeful for a new Star Trek series. Picard has as much to do with \"Star Trek\" as a frozen TV dinner has to do with a gourmet meal. The characters are flat, and lack the chemistry with each other that was always evident in all the other Star Treks. Suffered through the first 4 episodes & had to pull the plug. Sir Stewart please retire, Ms. Ryan you deserve better than this silly wanna be sci-fi . This show resembles one of the more boring Next Gen movies except even slower, darker, and less like Star Trek than ever before. If you enjoy very slow, very poorly written incoherent messes like the rest of anything Kurtzman has ever been involved with, you probably still won\\'t like this show. Don\\'t waste your time. When Gene Roddenberry created ST, it was with a sense of optimism and a profound belief in the power of people, whatever their planet of origin. This was encapsulated by the concepts of the Federation and the desire of people to expand our knowledge and understanding of ourselves and the universe around us. The original series reflected and recognised the social problems of the time and looked forward to when we were bigger than these issues by being better.ST: Picard is set in a slow, depressing and down beat galaxy (how did that happen?!?), the main protagonists, including Picard, are self absorbed, self serving and self centred. Gone is the ambition to make the world(s) a better place. They are operating in a cess pool of greed and corruption and appear to be very comfortable in that environment.I started watching ST TOS in the \\'70s, having enjoyed ALL the various iterations to varying degrees (yes, Discovery too). This however, is not Star Trek and after trying to find some redeeming feature in any of the 5 episodes aired so far, I\\'m giving up on it. I\\'m sorry for the harsh title but I mean it. This is not a Star Trek show or even a good show.The 1st episode makes it clear the writers never watched Star Trek. Ever. First off, there\\'s no currency in Star Trek. The writers forgot that and decided to reintroduce money into this. The peoples rid themselves of currency, thus creating a utopia, in the real Star Treks.\\nIn Picard, poverty, mercenaries, rich people, financial classes and woes are back like they never left.2nd, this has ultra-violent crap and ridiculously unnessecary swearing abound. This show caters to a sadistic and moronic audience who desires to see dystopian futures e.i. not Trekkies.All the good Star Trek shows, from the Original Series to Star Trek: Enterprise heavily valued living beings and hope. Enemies of the Federation would still be shown as people; living, thinking, breathing people. ST: Picard treats people like disposable garbage who will suffer gory fates with no end in sight. It is bleak and dreary, the opposite of what Star Trek is about. I love star trek but this show is too boring and lagging what Star Trek usually offers. Where is the star trek action and adventure that we come to love? I surely dont see it.this is too boring. Star Trek was philosophy, humanism and moral dilemmas presented in a gracious profound way. It was theater, it was inspiring, it was sublime.\\nStar Trek TNG was last bastion of culture in a TV series.And this... this is what writers can produce now.\\nThis is their best.\\nThis is what corporate art did with the most cherished franchises.\\nThis is woke culture not understanding how you present moral and political issues to the masses with grace and with emotional appeal.At the same time, this shows that people financing this has a total disconnection with art, society, and the viewers.This is a mockery of Star Trek.\\nFan productions in YT have more substance.\\nNobody will remember episodes of Discovery or Picard in 40 years.(Before i watched this i asked a friend his thoughts on this episode. I quote: \"\\nIts like if you asked me what do i think after seeing the face of Cthulhu, what would i say? Horror and Madness\")Many times i thought \"this is ill intended\", someone said \"There is too much philosophy in Star Trek, lets change that and make a sitcom\".\\nThese billionaires aproving this circus are living in the clouds, they just throw money, what else do they have?.For the first time Star Trek and Star Wars are \"United in Pain\".\\n(I posted this on the 5 episode, but it should be here)Please Seth McFarlane, buy Star Trek.\\nWe beg you.\\nMake Roddenberry proud. Please, someone should tell the writer to watch TNG. I am so sorry that Sir Patrick Stewart (who is acting flawless btw) got involved in this. Do not watch this show, is pure garbage. Just change the name of the show and nobody will know it\\'s Star Trek. But a huge disappointment, this show has nothing to do with the Star Trek. Script, acting, politics, federation etc. all ruined this show. What a wasted opportunity to do a high quality scifi show. I get the idea, our world is falling apart and so we need a trek show that isn\\'t as bluntly idealistic but one that is a bit colder, a bit crueler and in which Picard acts as like a Bernie Sanders in Space who remembers the values of old.That\\'s fine.But the show doesn\\'t deliver what similar shows like The Expanse, Galactica or Firefly gave us.The characters are flawed and broken, which is fine, but they are also bland, depressing, lifeless, joyless and just very very Dark And Brooding.This show has no moments of light to balance out its Dark And Grittiness.The show also has a Big Mystery in the spirit of Lost and I am not really hopeful The Mystery will be solved in a compelling way.This show is best avoided. Managed 4 episodes, waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen. Started the 5th and just couldn\\'t keep watching. Boring, Boring, Boring! Honestly, don\\'t bother. I wanted to like this, I tried for 4 episodes now. It is just not developing properly, and it feels like CBS went really cheap on us.Writing, dialogue and character development are all shallow and superficial. Production quality looks cheap.The departure from Star Trek in general is just huge without a strong justification.\\nThey make Jean-Luc come across as even older than he is. In fact they diminished him so much that it is almost insulting and they keep creating opportunities to remind us that he is too old for this. This I find weird, detrimental to the show and completely unnecessary.4 episodes of what amounts to a setup and the season has 10. They surely took their time. We are pretty much half way through and very little has developed.The ship, and the crew are just awful, deprived of almost all of the Star Trek feel. The Expanse\\'s Rocinante is a better, more exiting ship with a soul, character and a heck of a story to tell. If you want a real ragtag crew/ship, that\\'s where you\\'ll find it. Not in this sorry attempt to tell a different Star Trek story.The character dynamics in Picard suffer from something I\\'ve seen in too many shows that did not last long: extreme individualism, lack of compassion, selfishness, cynicism and mistrust. They are all in as a part of some deal, but what we really crave in drama is love, compassion, sacrifice and selflessness. Discovery injected these virtues into Star Trek correctly and artfully. Picard so far failed completely at this and created an emotional void that only amplifies other problems.The Federation resembles the Roman empire just before the collapse. They are infiltrated and run by all kinds of agenda with no real structure, mechanism -- and the will really -- to self-correct. Suddenly, in the 24th century after centuries of progress I am to believe that humans reverted to circa 2015, vaping, swearing, bickering and engaging in egoistic back-and-forth.And before you give me the Kurtzman explanation for swearing, that\\'s a prepared BS response to criticism which they expected. While it may be true that sweating was not a legal option in the early days of broadcast TV, Star Trek fans did come to understand it as a feature of the imagined better humanity, as symbolic as it is. They should have known this. Discovery used it sparingly and smartly. They knew the risks and they packaged it masterfully. This now is in your face -- \"because I can,\" probably even hoping to create controversy and social media discussion.The sense of awe and wonder is gone. Boundaries are not being pushed, human spirit is not being tested and challenged. Melancholy has set in and everyone seems riveted by grudges and ego.At times it feels like Jean-Luc is in a different sci-fi, an alien himself, struggling to fit into the writing of whatever this is, diminished to an almost miserable old man. So much going on with nothing really happening. Only being dragged out to keep viewership. No originality.\\nSome good characters and directing, but the writing really, really let\\'s this down. When I first reviewed Episode 1 I gave it 7/10. It was slow paced and nice world building. Also, I guess I was happy to see Picard again.Since then though this show has gone down hill so fast it is unbelievable. The next 2 episode are really boring and nothing of consequence happened. And in retrospect you should be grateful for that. Because once stuff does happen it is the worst you\\'ll ever see.Episode 5 was so dreadful that even hardcore NuTrek fans weren\\'t able to defend it anymore. This series has nothing to do with Star Trek anymore. Neither visually, nor the characters, nor the story and most certainly not the writing.This show is \"Star Trek\" in name only. Star Trek is dead and Alex Kurtzman will not stop dragging its corpse around in hopes of making a quick buck. There are 8 series planned for the near future and all of them will be a dark gloomy dystopia so much removed from Star Trek they might as well have made a random scifi show and just slapped the name on it - which is what they did basically anyway. Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is one of the best and most underrated shows on TV. It stars Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, a tough-as-nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show. He has another side, a vicious side, that Criminal Intent\\'s Robert Goren (Vincent D\\'Onofrio) lacks. I\\'m very pleased that he\\'s been nominated for an Emmy. Mariska Hargitay won an Emmy for her performance as Olivia Benson, another fantastic detective. Benson has more edge than CI\\'s Alex Eames (Kathrine Erbe), but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects. Her life is put in danger at least twice a season, yet she continues to be strong. Next is the sarcastic detective Jon Munch, played by the excellent comedian Richard Belzer. Munch may seem annoying at times, but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent, and he plays the \"good cop, bad cop\" role very well. The final detective is Finn Tutuola, played by former rapper Ice-T. Ice-T plays the character reasonably well, but I think we\\'d all like to see a meaner side of him. He was very good in the episodes entitled \"Rage,\" and \"Rooftop\". They are led by Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek, and Cragen is as good a captain as any, as Florek reprises his role he held on \"Law & Order\" for a few years. Adam Beach recently joined the show, bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost \\'surfer dude\\' approach to detective work. The ADA now is Casey Novak, played by Diane Neal, who could be better, but she gets the job done. She\\'s been better of late, and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show. Her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was great also. The team is also aided by an FBI psychiatrist, George Huang (BD Wong), who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person, witness or suspect. His best performance was in the episode called \"Coerced.\" The members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes (rape, rape-homicide) and child based crimes (school shootings, child abuse, child molestation). The show has had extraordinary guest stars, from evil (Johnny Messner, Reg Flowers, Asio Highsmith, Jeff Kober) to touching (Leland Orser, Jerry Lewis) to lost (Brittany Snow) to famous and legendary actors (Jerry Lewis, Dean Cain, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Matthew Modine, Alfred Molina, Cynthia Nixon, John Ritter). This is a truly great show that not only shows the line of work in this graphic department, but shows the emotional stress a detective goes through. 10/10 I have never one been that big of a fan of the original Law & Order. I would watch it for time to time and it was an alright show but never really had anything jump out at me to make it one of my can\\'t miss shows. Then this show came on. I watched this show when it premiered back in 1999 and was impressed from the get go. Sure it followed the basic premise of it\\'s original cousin but was much more loose on it\\'s format and execution. Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson. The whole cast as a whole is magnificent. Now I know a lot of people will disagree with me that this show is in no way better than the original but for me it is. It has given me something that the original never did. This used to be my favorite of the L&O franchise, until Stabler left. The last several seasons have done nothing but shamelessly pander to a political agenda, rather than focus on engaging plots, as they once did. It\\'s regrettable that this show has become such a disappointment. It feels like I\\'m watching a sinking ship. When I am communicating with other people interested in crime series it is remarkable how many people seem to watch either CSI or CSI: Miami or both. Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it\\'s programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday\\'s at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU\\'s spot has been Sunday\\'s around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That\\'s hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share\\'s of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn\\'t mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI\\'s, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it\\'s quality.The thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that\\'s just another \\'trick\\' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera\\'s. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.Also all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it\\'s emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode\\'s that featured theme\\'s or events from the investigator\\'s home environment (especially Stabler\\'s). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual\\'s background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer\\'s (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I\\'d given this series an 8 out of 10 I\\'m much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I\\'ve come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March\\'s character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A\\'s job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang\\'s intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media\\'s depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T\\'s character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).The reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche\\'s of both victim\\'s and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. 9 out of 10 Quality is the foundation that \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" is based upon. With compelling storylines, great performances and a first-rate cast; \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" radiates from the screen each hour it is on every night. Dick Wolf has combined quality writing with quality casting in the second of three series\\' in the \"Law & Order\" franchise.Mariska Hargitay, Christopher Meloni, Ice-T, Dann Florek, B.D. Wong and Richard Belzer all share one thing in common: they star in one of finest series on television.Mariska, Chris, Ice-T, Dann, B. D. and Stephanie March are a well-rounded cast that bring great depth to their characters and compliment each other very well. Furthermore, the cast portray their characters so well that I have to remind myself that they are actors not detectives.Quality writing and outstanding performances set \"Law And Order: SVU\" apart from the other dramas on television. Each episode is riveting, written with intelligence, and character driven. It is a privilege to watch \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\"The writers\\' ability to draw viewers in and make them care about the involving storylines and characters help to make \"Law & Order: SVU\" one of the finest legal series on television. Ok let\\'s start by saying I use to love this show. However this new season that has come out 2017/2018 is absolutely ridiculous. It has so many political views and bs left/right motivation in it that it has lost me as a viewer. I don\\'t even live in America, I\\'m Australian, I enjoyed it for what it was. \"Law\" and \"Order\" I enjoyed seeing the crime and then the person hopefully being punished for it. Now though, well according to the last episode I watched. 2/2/18. It would appear it has gone all political. I understand keeping with the times but its a law and order show, none of that stuff needs to be in it. Show some sort of rape/abuse etc and then the investigation and court proceedings like you have been doing since 1999, why bring all this alt left, alt right bs into now??? Personally I recommend skip anything new from this show and just go back to the original episodes where it was about the crime and solving it, not trying to push an agenda into your minds that in reality no one really cares about. I used to adore SVU, watched it religiously, but regretfully this series should have retired gracefully instead of giving us endlessly telenovela illogical plots, based on emotions and nothing to do with the law. Law and Order it certainly isn\\'t. I hear on tv that apparently America\\'s favorite Law and Order is the original. I personally think this is the best one out of all of them. It tackles some pretty intersting sides of society and humanity within an hour. I\\'ve been watching it for awhile and fell in love with the cast. They all have that hard edge that comes from doing a job like their\\'s. Marishka is great and Ice-T is amusing. The storylines are very interesting and groundbreaking. In my classes, I\\'ve heard about the Down-Low phenomenon amongst black males in the U.S. This is the first show, aside from Oprah, that dealt with this issue. I was amazed and pleased that they\\'ll take on any topic within their framework. Their guest cast should be praised as well. They have a great casting director. I don\\'t know about their history with Emmy nominations, but they should definitely be in the running. The show has a very easy going nature despite the hardness of the cast that works well and acted beautifully.  It gives a real look at society\\'s imperfections and discriminatory ideologies. Nobody on the show is perfect and even the lawyers manipulate the law beyond the usual scope people think they do. Instead, they are manipulating it to see justice done and not avoided. I would urge anyone to watch this show. Give it a look. She\\'s the executive producer, and now the \"executive actor.\" She dominates every plot, every action, every aspect of the show. The rest of the cast has been reduced to less than minor roles. Moreover, this ruins the show\\'s previous \"police accuracy.\" \"Cragen\" ran the unit; Benson runs the unit, personally conducts the investigation and interviews, makes the arrest. Too much. The show needs to restore its balance. I started watching this on Netflix as a binge show. I fell in love with the original cast from the beginning. Stabler kept Benson in check, and Capt. Kragen kept them both in check. Then comes season 11 (i think it was) that ends with Stabler shooting the kid in their squad room. So no more stable to keep Benson on track. Then one of the best characters retires - Sgt. Munch. and the show needs a new Sgt. so who else but Benson gets it. Oh and then Kragen retires, and now they need a new leader, so obviously, this show is now The Olivia Benson show. It\\'s stopped being about the SVU, it\\'s now a drama about Benson. Her kidnapping, her torture, her adoption, etc.They need to get back on track and involve the rest of the cast more, like they used to do. This 1 man (or woman rather) team of Olivia Benson and her wishy washy law enforcement is getting really old. I finally made it through season 20, I\\'m finding it very hard to make myself start watching Season 21 Leave the left partinship out of it. I want to be entertained when I turn off the news, not watch a scripted make-believe version of an op-ed. Used to tune into law and order every now and then growing up. Tuning into the newer seasons has ceased secondary to the blatenetly obvious bash course it chooses to take in all conservative values whilst pushing leftist garbage. No thanks and no thanks. I used to love this show but now it is just so far fetched, asinine or far left liberal storylines that it is just no longer enjoyable to watch. I think it has over stayed it\\'s welcome. The acting is haphazard, the characters are one dimensional and loathsome, and the writing is predictable and trashy. I hate this show so much, the only reason I joined IMDb was to communicate to the world how odious this show is. Please, if it is remotely within your capacity, take this show off the air. If you have a positive view of the world, of humanity, the government, or the criminal justice system, do not watch this show. It not only communicates the sensationalized myth of the need for fear, but it also depicts public officials as sinister, self- righteous villains for whom if violence could ever be justified, it would be justified against the characters portrayed as protagonists in this show. Quality is the foundation that \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" is based upon as it illuminates from the screen each hour it is on every night.Dick Wolf has combined quality writing with quality casting. Mariska Hargitay, Christopher Meloni, Ice-T, Dann Florek, B.D. Wong and Richard Belzer all share one thing in common: they star in one of finest series on television.Mariska, Chris, Ice-T, Dann, B.

Furthermore, the cast is so good portraying their characters that I have to remind myself that they are actors not detectives.Quality writing and outstanding performances set \"Law And Order: SVU\" apart from the other dramas on television.

It is a privilege to watch \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\"The writers\\' ability to draw viewers in and make them care about the involving story lines and characters help to make \"Law & Order: SVU\" one of the finest legal series on television. EVERYONE MUST WATCH. Another crime show that is being ruined by propagandistic infiltration. I have watched every episode, and I have been disappointed to see more politically charged episodes during the last 4 seasons. They clearly take sides, and they end up being disrespectful and undermining the very difficult jobs of law enforcement agencies including the police and ICE. I will not watch another season. Once was an alright show. Now it\\'s all political. Nothing but liberal rhetoric. Stopped watching after last season. All the storylines are repetitive. Terrible writing. Nothing to hold the viewers interest. Time to archive SVU. Maybe future generations will dig this out of the scrap pile and wonder why in the world anyone would waste their time watching this garbage. This show is such a disapointment-political agenda and neverending pans of the characters faces mostly good old mariska and tired understanding feel good dialogue-it used to be a great cop show now it should be shown about two oclock in the afternoon with the rest of the soap operas. L&O: SVU is by far the worst of the L&O franchise, and one of the worst shows ever to appear on TV, any network, any language: It suffers from the late-MASH syndrome, where all minor characters have to have a part and are all buddy-buddy. The writers can\\'t use jargon without immediately defining its social meaning. Benson: \"He\\'s a pedophile.\" Ice-T: \"Yeah, 32% of pedophiles rape kids under 8, yo, word.\"Mariska Hargitay has one basic expression: shocked horror. And what\\'s with Benson\\'s one cure-all for everything? Talk therapy. No, dear, some things should be bottled up and never spoken of again.They have something in for prep kids. What, was Dick Wolf turned down by the Philip Exeter Academy or something?It\\'s a bizarre combination of far-left socializing plus far-right tactics, yielding an overall effect eerily reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution in China.Why is Richard Belzer on this show? Munch was a great character on Homicide. They don\\'t write to either his character or the actor\\'s capabilities at all.Are these cops supposed to be NYPD cops?! *NEW YORK?* Playing social worker? No. New York cops solve crimes, they don\\'t play social worker. Victims are chumps, perps are prey. Bizarre.Where is the real \"SVU\" horror of the welfare mom in a roach-infested hovel starving the kids while hubby rapes them? It\\'s an incredibly \"clean\" show. In the dictionary of American TV jargon, this show is featured next to the phrase, \"Jumped the shark\". Here\\'s why:The last episode of the current season--Benson and the ADA (don\\'t remember her name) perform a surgical procedure on the Medical Examiner while she\\'s conscious and directing them, screeching in alleged pain, after the M.E. been shot in the chest.Get real.This travesty is clearly aiming for syndication on the Lifetime channel or Oxygen. Better to kill it off now and put us out of our misery.Richard Belzer and Ice-T ought to have their own spin off show, but a comedy this time-- they\\'d be much more at home. This is not to say that they\\'re not good at their craft, but simply that they\\'ve been given such wretched material over the run of the show. I could see them in their own \"buddy cop\" show--I might even watch it. The rest of them can rot in syndication, and Dann Florek can keep doing his gold commercials--apparently what he\\'s paid for them has \"never been worth zero\". Unfortunately, this show has outlived its usefulness.January 2012: I can\\'t believe I\\'m writing this. Harry Connick Jr. has joined the cast as an \"Executive Assistant to the DA\". Isn\\'t \"Executive Assistant\" an overpaid secretary? The first thing that sprang to mind after I saw him in character on screen was \"Elvis movie\". As a huge fan of Harry Connick\\'s music, I am equally disappointed in his choice to take on this role. Stiff and stumbling don\\'t even begin to describe it. Stick to jazz, Harry. I don\\'t know why they had to start making this show so political? I use to love this show. Last season (2017) I almost gave up on it, but pushed to the end hoping they would give us an evening of entertainment instead of putting our minds right back on the problems we are watching TV to forget about for a few minutes. They can\\'t seem to do it anymore. They lose the crime plot now for the political plot. Not the kind of show I like to watch. It you do then you will love it. For me I am no longer watching the show. I watch SVU from beginning, even though I liked the original Law and Order better. But since CPT cragen retired and Olivia Benson assumed as lutenant, show took a wrong turn and there\\'s no law nor order in the show. It\\'s just all about left-wing political bs all the time, and feminism, and all that crap.\\nShould\\'ve retired the show gracefully.\\nNow it\\'s just another show starring a boring, delusional SJW who sees bad in everything (oh Olivia, what have they done to you?!) and about political correctness and all that bs.\\n0/10 nowadays.\\nNot for our surprise, the ratings from law and order SVU are dropping hard. SVU used to be one of my favourite shows. There\\'s been some incredible, edge-of-your-seat episodes like \"911\", but now it\\'s mostly he-said she-said\\'s and statutory rapes between two willing participants (i.e. 15 year old girl and 16 year old guy). Yes, it\\'s more realistic and true to life, but that\\'s not why I watch TV like this. If I wanted realistic crime shows I\\'d watch Highway Cops or something - not Law & Order.The political agenda pushing that\\'s become central to the show is beyond aggravating. As the most liberal, feminist, pro-immigration, anti-racist, anti-fascist person around, having the views I already believe in forced down my throat every time I\\'m trying to chill out and watch TV is frustrating. It\\'s also even more frustrating knowing how pointless it is - SVU is a crime show, it\\'s not going to make anyone reconsider their politics, and it\\'s dumb to isolate people from a show they\\'ve enjoyed for decades just because their politics differ to yours. The way it\\'s all approached feels really patronising and tacky too - and the \"my way is the right way\" attitude is unhelpful in creating any positive political discussion.Season 19 has been better than the past few seasons - there\\'s been a few more engaging plot lines. It\\'s still not even close to how it used to be though, where virtually every episode was an 8/10 with 9\\'s being a common occurrence. Now it\\'s more like every episode is a 5/10, and we\\'re lucky if we get a 7.I don\\'t watch the show regularly anymore; I just resort to it when there\\'s literally nothing else I can think of to watch. It sucks because it was so good, and I don\\'t even think the new cast is too bad (yeah, they\\'re not the OG\\'s, but I can deal with it if the plots are good). It seemed to get a lot worse when Mariska Hargitay took over as Executive Producer.Bring back engaging plots please and stop the political tripe. :( I watched SVU a lot before but now it\\'s just soap all the way. Just sad to watch really. This has become my favorite regular show on the main networks.  The stories are good enough to keep me watching and the character interplay can be quite amusing at times.  Gibbs is great...watching the others react to him makes me chuckle.  Abby is perfectly believable, despite the goth overtones...she is strong, smart, yet still sexy and feminine.  I think Pauley Perette was the ideal actress to cast.  The writing seems to continue at an even keel...if nothing else getting better as more episodes are shown.  I think the producers have a hit here.  I go back each week.  Definitely worth your time...even if it means taping or tivo\\'ing it (which I do)...something to look forward to when I can\\'t make 8:00 on Tuesday. and each episode speeds along all too quickly! I LOVE this show\\x85! What is there NOT to like? Rich story lines, strongly portrayed (and very human) personalities you can really warm to who play off each other brilliantly, all with their own distinctive quirks and \\x96 above all \\x96 the always wonderful Mark Harmon as main character! What more could you ask for in a show?! There\\'s not a single character I\\'d change \\x96 none that irritate \\x96 they\\'re all excellent. I consider it a bonus that it\\'s the one thing on TV that all our family equally enjoy for different reasons. Even my father-in-law likes this and we normally have totally different viewing preferences! I was delighted when I heard that there was a second series imminent. Only problem is that living in England, who knows how long after it\\'s shown in the US we\\'ll get to see it! Fortunately it\\'s worth the wait! Easily one of the best shows on television today, suspenseful, humorous and real-not always pleasant or formulaic-but real! Just when I think Bellesario has gone too far in the \"lets screw up Jag\" sweepstakes (ok-2 episodes this year were actually good-the rest-terrible!)-he redeems himself with a show that is riveting, timely and funny at the right times!The casting, the writing, the overall look of the show is first class! Starting at the top with Mark Harmon, the sexiest man on TV-he also sets the tone with his right on portrayal of the most conflicted man on TV today! His obsession with Ari (the terrorist), his list of rules, then his tendency to think out of the box just adds to the spice and pace of this show. (Plus his constant dueling with DiNozzo-priceless!)An added plus is the inter meshing of the cast-David McCallum-funny, urbane- so hot! His stories are hysterical, then his sad commentary on the life or death of their latest subject-just gives you pause. His diatribe on the terrorist and what he did to his assistant alone is Emmy award stuff-don\\'t mess with Ducky ever again! Then we have the reason for Rule 12-Special Agent Catlin Todd-the writers don\\'t always have a clue as to her portrayal but she always pulls it off (and that humor of hers-the end lines alone are great!) I have to disagree as to the chemistry with Gibbs/Kate-it\\'s there all right-hopefully we get to see something come of it in Season 2! The actors portraying Abby and DiNozzo-Pauly Perrette and Michael Weatherly are hysterical, yet right on in their portrayals-especially when DiNozzo thinks with his hormones and not with his brain-then turns around and saves the day-this show is a keeper! I can hardly wait for season 2! At first when my husband would watch this show I wasn\\'t really paying much attention and I would see this goth girl in the lab and think  \"what on earth is THAT?!?!?!\" Then, one night I sat and watched along with him and now I am totally hooked. Mark Harmon\\'s character appears to be annoyed sometimes by the other characters actions etc. but you get the feeling he really likes his coworkers. I like David McCallum\\'s character and the way they tease him about going on and on. I get the feeling he knows they really do like him but his stories just get to be too much for them and he understands. My favorite though is Pauley Perrette\\'s character. She is just a lot of fun. I hope the show stays on a long time- Tuesday nights wouldn\\'t be the same with out it. 1st Zeva leaves, then Tony and finally Abby. The cast that built the legend on NCIS has been reduced to a couple now and the new adds (except for Maria Bello) are not providing the intrigue and drama that was the previous NCIS. As a devoted fan I am slowly but surely finding the show becoming a non- watch instead of a must see. We used to schedule our lives to make sure we never missed an episode. As Ziva David, Tony Dinnozo, And Abby Have left the show, the show has become very lame and very uninteresting. Tony once said, \"We need the Pa. Now I know what He was referring to.All the PA\\'s have left the show, and we are left with D- Characters. Basically kind of toward being a clear F in my opinion.The TV Show has lost it\\'s spark, which is very sad. When the show first aired it had a freshness to it and I really liked it a lot (Actually gave it 8/10 Stars) Now I would only give it 4/10 Stars.We have decided not to continued to watch this in the following Season(s) to come.I wish the Characters well in the future Season(s) I\\'ve been a fan since the beginning and have watched every episode but with all the changes in the last year or two, the show has lost what made it great. The relationships between Tony and Kate and then Tony and Ziva added something special. Tony\\'s and Abbey\\'s personalities made it even better but now there\\'s just nothing. They took away what made the show great and didn\\'t add anything to make up for it. It also seems that Mark Harmon is tired of the show and it shows in his acting. He doesn\\'t have the gusto he used to. Unfortunately , NCIS has gone downhill, become boring to watch, and I may not continue to do so. When the show first started out it was a little shaky, but since then has grown into its own. The characters are believable, both annoying and enchanting, and the plots are wonderful. There\\'s a depth and a comradeship that isn\\'t often showed this well in television. It isn\\'t forced or faked; it\\'s entirely true to life and believable. The underlying sexual tension between several of the characters is also intriguing and interesting to watch, the most obvious of these being the relationship between Tony and Kate, but there\\'s also hints at Kate and Gibbs, McGee and Abby, and so on. It\\'s a crime drama that\\'s both serious and light-hearted, and a wonderful show for anyone who likes fascinating stories, good humor, and great character interaction. Tony Dinozzo (Michael Weatherly) was the character that really made this show come to life for me. He was interesting, a film buff and very unlike the typical gungho cop you get in shows like this. When he left (and I know there were characters leaving before him) it left a huge gap that the new stable of characters just can\\'t fill. In fact there have been a few newbies come in since he left and they are all so boring I cannot even think of their first names. Now Abby has also left and so we really only have Jethro, Ducky and Probie left. Probie was always a supporting character a good straight man to Dinozzo. Jethro worked well with the original cast but now looks bored but happy to be raking in the cash. Ducky is still interesting but not on the show as often as he used to be. And the others? Who cares. Not much left in the way of talent - The Tim character is now flat and uninspired- the Abbey replacement is more a cartoon character- and the scripts are uninspired- too bad - no longer interested in NCIS. Finally Bellisario got it right.  Gibbs and his gang are first and foremost investigators, not hoity-toity staff officers who moonlight as stereotyped combat soldiers with thickly-laid-on patriotic dogma that would make Ward Carroll vomit with rage.  At no time do they ever try to borrow an F-14 to go on some bombing raid over the international hot spot du semaine; they stick to their job descriptions the whole time.  They also have personalities and eccentricities that make them a better ridealong than overstarched Harmless Rabbit and whatever babe he happens to be working with this season, such as Gibbs\\' coffee addiction, Ducky\\'s intellectual ramblings, DiNozzo\\'s attempts at being a cool womanizer, Abby\\'s interesting blend of science nerd and goth grrrl, and Kate as the token vaguely normal neophyte thrown into the mix.  Too bad this couldn\\'t have been done with JAG in the first place. I\\'ve written about this show before on IMDb --- but here I am months later in May 2005 and yet it still continues to be impressive. There have been a few shows that were \"bleh\" in the last season but the \"SWAK\" episode tonight really got a few great moments of emotion between the cast members. The writers (at least to me) were able to pull off the \"suspended disbelief\" and I got pulled into the moment as DiNozzo was about to kick the bucket. I sure hope they keep most of the cast in the next season, as they seem to play off each other brilliantly. The only cast member I could see losing (according to the season finale preview, they lose an NCIS agent) is McGee. He\\'s great and believable for his role, but any of the others lost as regulars on the show would break down the core character interplay. The McGee character could be replaced...but the others would be much more difficult. But then again I guess this is all decided and in the can...we\\'ll find out on May 24th. My comments to other viewers that have commented on the reality of the series --- yeah, it\\'s not the real life NCIS at all. But real life would be mind-numbingly boring to fit in 60 minute TV show. You\\'d need the constant buzz of fluorescent lights in the background combined with pages and pages of forms being typed into the computer --- mostly about drug abuses by young 18 year olds. This is TV drama and a fabricated fiction. I appreciate the nod Bellesario gives to NCIS and like the show for the entertainment it is. Real life NCIS isn\\'t a fun job, but we get an hour on Tuesday night to pretend it is. Same old stories over and over. Gibbs is way to old, they would not have a man of his years in the lead, it\\'s farcical.Ncis Los Angeles is much better escapism. Just finished binge watching Season 14 and I have watched this show since the beginning. Maybe the producers or whomever are trying to set a record for the length of the series, but there is little other reason for this show to continue. The exit of vital characters like Ziva & DiNozzo has created a downward slide into mis-casting key roles and creating dubious plots. The one bright spot in casting is Reeves, the MI6 transplant - both the actor and the character bring a breath of fresh air to the otherwise dowdy team. The loss of Vance\\'s wife and Ziva\\'s father was a preposterous plot twist. The addition of Quinn and Torres to fill the gaps in the NCIS team is weak and failing. Quinn has nothing to do and Torres doesn\\'t belong there. Neither character is interesting nor entertaining in any way. Maybe, like Reeves, the producers should have considered another foreign import, French or Swedish?, to add some dimension. Bishop is marginally effective as an analyst, but is not believable as a field agent. It would have been better to keep her married and have her be the nerdy info bank who gathers and sorts backgrounds & personality profiles, even if it were a smaller role. That kind of role would be a fair replacement for the departing Abby, and Bishop\\'s tricky relationship with her NSA lawyer-husband would have brought new fodder to episodes. And why do we have to be subjected to Jimmy Palmer\\'s buffoonery in every episode, said buffoon scenes becoming longer with each passing season? I\\'m also now very tired of Franks showing up in a delusion to drive a story. Kind of pathetic. There is lots more I could say but basically it\\'s time for this series to go out with some dignity left. I know the show has been slated for a 16th season but I can\\'t imagine it getting any better if it stays on the same path. I have watched every episode but the new abby replacement stinks. Hope they find a better replacement soon. What started out as an amazing series for many years has declined over the past few and had unfortunately become something rather senile. Occasionally serious with a lot of something which appears to try to imitate humor but greatly lacks it and sadly the wit is gone I knew she was coming as soon as I heard the character was leaving and Duckys assistant arrived. No thanks.It is a shame they killed off MI6 officer, now Im wondering if he will be replaced.I may just quit watching this now. I am very disappointed with this season\\'s cast changes. I have been a loyal fan of NCIS from the very beginning. I\\'ve always enjoyed the show and thought the writing was great and the characters were believable. But Jennifer Esposito has all but ruined the show for me. I find her to be rude, arrogant, obtrusive and obnoxious. She definitely Does Not fit in with the team! Wilmer Valderrama may eventually fit in, once he learns that he is there to work, not to flirt with every skirt on the show and search for apartments while he is supposed to be working a crime scene! Also, the writing has taken a decided turn for the worse - the character\\'s parts are all over the place, and it seems they have no idea what they are doing with Jimmy Palmer this season. The show used to be balanced, told a good story, and treated all of the characters well. Now it seems they have lost their way caring more about jumping on the politically correct, diversity, and inclusive bandwagon than with creating the award winning show they have had for all these years. Very sad to see such a great show fall apart like this :-( *SPOILERS NCIS* The NCIS (Navy Criminal Investigative Service) is a service that investigates on any kind of crime, from barroom brawls to international terrorism, that involves men and women from the Navy or Marine Corps.The team is formed by: Leroy Jethro Gibbs (the second B stays for Bastard) (Mark Harmon), the moody, intuitive head investigator; he likes his coffee very strong, his women with red hair, and his investigations thorough. It is rare to get a compliment for him; when you get one, don\\'t ask why. He is very loyal, and actually cares for his team, but has problems with women (evidence of this being three failed weddings). Anthony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Gibbs\\' 2IC; a smartmouth, player to the soul and proud of it, who masks his quick mind and powerful intuition with a happy-go-lucky (and sometimes obnoxious) attitude. Sometimes he can behave in quite the juvenile way, and when he is, a good headslap by Gibbs will help him put things straight (this two have also what could possibly be the strongest homosexual subtext - more of an almost-text - in TV History). He enjoys to torment someone, usually the newest element of the team. Dearly departed Special Agent Kate Todd (more later) and Special Agent Tim McGee (more later) have suffered the brunt of that in various occasions. Comes from money, but doesn\\'t get an allowance because if he did, he wouldn\\'t work, and it seems there is bad blood between him and his family. He has a deep love of movies and TV Shows (one of his favorites is \\'Ozzy And Harriet\\'), and referred to movie-acquired knowledge various times.Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander), killed in the Season 2 Finale, who came from Secret Service, and made a point of bringing it up whenever the occasion presented itself, and came off as quite the uptight girl; all in all, the weakest character in the show, though her witty \\'Hepburn-Tracy\\' rapid-fire dialogues with DiNozzo were great, and she had with him the strongest hetero almost-text this side of Gil Grissom and Catherine Willows.Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) a perky Goth (not as oxymorous as it sounds) who has an imprecise number of tattoos on her body and is the greatest at her job. She loves to hear techno or hard rock music (like Android Lust) played at a very loud volume while working. She is the only person in the team Gibbs actually shows affection for, and she is currently dating Special Agent Tim McGee (more later).Tim McGee (Sean Murray), who joined the team in the second season after making various guest-appearances throughout the first season. Tim is a computer whiz, but is at a loss when it comes to social life; has gotten a tattoo on his butt to impress Sciuto - and it worked. Has been mercilessly teased by DiNozzo when he first joined the team, getting the absolutely-not-flattering nickname \\'Probie\\' (\\'Pivello\\' (\\'Greenhorn\\') in the Italian Version). He has proved his valor, though, time and time again.And last but not least, Donald \\'Ducky\\' Mallard (David McCallum), the ME, who has two curious habits; one, to talk to the corpses he is going to autopsy, and the other, to go off on tales that are very loosely related to the case in question. He likes the music Abby plays, but not distorted by speakers, lives with his mother, who, wearing only Chanel N°5 when she goes to bed, hosts very awkward slumber parties and has various dogs, he is the one who has worked the longest with Gibbs and looked like \\'Ilya Kuryakin\\' when he was younger.This is the team (I\\'m not talking about Ziva and Madame Director because I have yet to see Season 3), and my suggestion is to watch them in action, every Tuesday, 8/7 central, on CBS.You won\\'t be disappointed.NCIS: 9/10. Season 17 started with a bang with Ziva making a 2 episode return. Now she has gone and with her any talented script writers.\\nIt has now returned to the smaltzy dribble it has been since Ziva left.\\nIf you like this sort of thing watch The Waltons . This is now a program this is long past its best. I guess all the time it makes money it will run. Oh for the days of Tony, Abby, Kate and Ziva........... Oh, what an engaging show this used to be... I still remember episodes from more than a decade ago with Sasha Alexander. Ziva was a solid replacement, ably supported by Tony and Ducky. Gibbs was a no-nonsense, high-and-tight Marine. There was action, there was intrigue, there was natural humor, there were genuinely poignant moments even during the slower, more personal scenes. Those moments were moving because they felt real and because they involved characters we cared about.The past couple of years have upturned almost all of that. Almost all the core personalities are gone. Those still there (Gibbs, McGee, and--occasionally--Ducky) have been emasculated to the point where you begin wondering if McGee and Jimmy are going to start making out during one of their heart-to-hearts. Gibbs is becoming more of a senile grandpa with each episode. Other characters have come and gone: the gorgeous Jennifer Esposito, the black English dude, McGee\\'s disabled wife... As for the shrink (Jack) and the new Abby (a.k.a. a female Steve Urkel), the less said the better. Torres and Bishop are okay but they\\'re never going to fill the shoes of Ziva David and Anthony DiNozzo. I think the only character worth his salt anymore is Director Vance.Then there\\'s the storylines and plots. The show has taken on a distinctly politically-correct tone. Seasons 16 has so far managed to dredge up racism form the 1960s as well as feature sermonizing about the environment... - and that\\'s just two episodes! It\\'s now a hybrid of the Gilmore Girls, Lethal Weapon, and Dr. Phil.It pains me to say it but this show is well past its sell-by date. It\\'s time to put it out of its misery. May this season (#16) be the last so the show is retired with _some_ (albeit not much) dignity left... These story lines USED to be about Naval personnel and the problems they encountered---with the NCIS Team helping resolve them.Anymore, most of these programs are about the \"personnel interactions\" between team members. For example, Tony and Ziva: for weeks and weeks, he has been trying to get her back from Israel and get her to love him. This has become so tiresome...tiresome...tiresome.And Gibbs storyline involving shooting down some of his own friends is to far out of his to-date character line that it is amost comical, to say the least.Please, Writers, whatever you do, please get OFF this track. You are losing fans! Earlier seasons are very good, with a lot of strong, interesting characters, Todd, Ziva, Tony, Abby, Ducky, McGee, Gibbs, ... after so many main characters exited the show, they were replaced with extremely mediocre ones (Quinn, Sloane, Torres, or Jackson, etc.), the one replaced Abby was the worst. Don\\'t bother watch the current season, it\\'s simply garbage now. This is a great series to watch.  I have been hooked on this show since the beginning because I love watching mysteries and crime like CSI and CSI Miami.  Harmon\\'s so sexy in this role and McCallum is always a joy to watch as Ducky especially when he\\'s on the role over various anthropology lectures which to my amusement everyone on that shows roll up their eyeballs. This show used to be in my top 5 must not miss shows every week until season 14. I honestly don\\'t know what they were thinking when they forced Bishop & Kasie on us. Those 2 have ruined the show for me. I can tolerate the other 2 newbies, Torres & Sloane, to a point, but they too aren\\'t the best fit either. It was great to bring back Ziva this season as an attempt to keep us interested, but it\\'s a little too late because the damage has already been done the last few seasons. I can no longer watch without cringing every time Bishop & Kasie are on the screen because they just don\\'t belong on this show. So many other loyal fans have said the same things & it amazes me they haven\\'t replaced these horrible characters yet, but maybe the plan is to end the show, so they figure why bother writing in better characters. Anyway, I just want to say how much I truly enjoyed every season up to 13. I put up with most of season 14 only because I love Jennifer Esposito & wanted to see where that was going, but the minute they forced that out of nowhere relationship Bishop had onto us & then had her go all crazy & murder that guy it made me sick to my stomach to watch after that. I actually forced myself to keep watching just because I kept thinking things would change & that maybe Bishop would get fired for what she did or get demoted, since that\\'s what it seemed was going to happen, except nothing happened. I guess the writers just gave up trying after that. I finally stopped watching it weekly after Kasie joined the team, though because she\\'s the absolute worst fit of any character that\\'s ever been on the show & I just couldn\\'t stomach watching it after that. Last month I went back to try & catch up before this new season started by trying to skip through the parts when she came on & parts where it was just Bishop, too, but it\\'s just not worth the trouble, so I am officially done watching for good now. It\\'s such a shame how they made it so many seasons picking good characters that fit well with each other & with Gibbs, but then they just stopped trying after season 13. Thanks for 13 great seasons at least. You have failed this show! The first two seasons were brilliant. -meaningful flashbacks -great villains -good pacing -fitting dark tone Season 3 had a drop in quality, and season 4 completely butchered a fantastic show. In season 4: -horrible meaningless flashbacks -worse acting -terrible villains -unfitting lighter tone -illogical story lines with many plot holes -more like a soap opera than a superhero/crime drama TV show -butchering of major story lines like Andy Diggle, Oliver\\'s child, HIVERating for season 1 and 2: 8.7/10 Rating for season 3: 7.5/10 Rating for season 4: 5/10 After episodes of trying and trying I have fainlly stopped watching Arrow, Left it Midway season 6. Season 1 and 2 of the show were pure GOLD. Season 3 the show got a little sloppy. Season 4 was just terrible. Season 5 went surprisingly good and season 6 is just very boring and and terrible.\\nThe show lost its spark after season 3 and Arrow \\'s new \"team\" is just unbearable. If you compare it with Team Flash. The show lost its Billionaire Playboy Charm and the Dark cool Arrow long back, even Felicity and Diggle are annoying now. It feels like Greg Berlanti just lost his focus from the show.\\nI hope they gain back the Season 1 spark. The first 2 seasons of the show was amazing however after that it got stale and boring. I decided to give up less than half way through season 5. The flashbacks become uninteresting. The villains after 2 seasons are boring. Love story is soap opera material. Season 4 made the show unrealistic with the sci-fi magic. Arrow was more interesting when he was working alone without any sidekicks. An excellent show till season 5. From season 6 show started to decline. Season 7 is a mess, slow, boring and totally confusing. From half season 7 episodes, production introduced some new characters to the show, the main characters sons and daughters. In an inconsistent and confusing manner and in a different timeline. Probably they decided to cancel the original show and are preparing the way for a new show \"Arrow sons 2\" in the future. I am only watching it because i am curious how they will end it. I used to love this show. When it began, the mere athleticism of Stephen Amell used to give me goosebumps and I would have rated it an 8, even 9. But with the passing of time (I think somewhere around Season 4), the quality of writing started dropping. Actors can do only so much (and they do give their best every time) with this kind of material. Some characters have become sort of hangers on and should be put out of their misery.I sure hope things pick up in Season 7. This was one of the best TV shows you watch for comic book genre, It started of great well lit up scenes with loads of action, suspense and a good story-line, suddenly all of that was thrown out and made a weak series in which the main character reveals himself all the time and the action is terrible to watch, no suspense, no general direction of the character, in almost every episode its the same dialogue \"Oliver if you want them to trust you, you should let them know who you are, and Oliver takes of his eye piece and says \"I am the Green Arrow\" L.O.L What Dafuq.The show is just going down hill, specially that now the main character is now Felicity (sleeps with all the Billionaires and take their fortune and keeps them under her payroll) worst character, Thea Queen 2nd billionaire famous line \"I am out\". Just keep the group small and the action hardcore like 1st season, identity reveal yeah stop that, let the character start killing again, and please don\\'t bring dead people back to make their own show.Season 1 - Great. Season 2 - Just OK. Season 3 - What is happening.Season 4 - Why are you killing the show. Season 5 - I give up, cant watch anymore. Season 6 - Stopped watching. This show started off great from season 1, onto season 2, then it began to slow down a bit in season 3 and 4, but it picks up again with action in season 5. There are many story line build ups, and great flashbacks, and it also compliments with the action and fight scenes. One major critic of the show will be how the writers will often attempt to put in too many love sequences in a super hero show, another will be how the story doesn\\'t follow up as well with the Green Arrow comics. If the show sticks to its action first and love story later, it will stay more consistent to what fans would love to see, and this will keep the show alive for a longer number of seasons. The best part of this show is that it provides its viewers with crossover episodes, and team ups with other super hero shows such as the Flash. These crossover episodes provides more action and delivers a comic book genre type of team up for fans or even non comic book fans to enjoy. On a side note, season 2 of this show is by far the best TV show season I have ever watched. Even if you do not have time watching this show, just watch season 2, you won\\'t regret it. It\\'s becoming so boring that every bad guy in the series has more brains, more skills and more bravery than Oliver Queen. It has failed the fans making the Arrow a weak, troublesome individual that really anybody can defeat. Start making him more astute, more strong, and wiser than his enemies. The series is plagued with Oliver\\'s failures to succeed. You have a great potential for the series do not waste it on stupid writing. We want to see a strong Arrow not a weak one defeated by everybody. Make him a winner again. Team arrow is pretty lame. It\\'s like they went from a show for adolescents and adult to a show for kids The first two seasons were incredible but from there henceforth it\\'s kinda boring Arrow... I was looking forward and waiting this show to start, but from season to season its get more unwatchable... Last season with the kids??? Come on, please make the next season be the final one... It was tolerable up to season 4, that\\'s where everyone became emotional extremists and critically irrational for most of the show. There are inconsistencies, events that make no sense, too much hypocrisy from every character who demands respect and honesty but continuously lies and disrespects in every episode. The arrow team plans fail 90 percent of the time making them look incompetent, evil is portrayed as stronger and smarter, while good is portrayed as stupid and weak, the only way to win is by luck and not skill for the arrow team. Really disappointing.That said, I enjoy the performance of the actors and will continue to watch, even though it feels like I\\'m sticking needles in my eyes at times with everything this series irritates me with. I can no longer watch, although I still like the key characters and how they use to be in earlier seasons, I can\\'t stand the whole stupid Diaz storyline. He gets away with everything... as if.. so unrealistic, illogical and cartoonish.\\nThe villains are so so evil and yet they always have the upper hand, and the heroes are presented as too weak to prevail not too mention that agencies supposedly on the good side of the law also side against the heroes.. I mean... really.\\nNo wonder there is so many bullies in the real world, they are in most tv shows today, and they are always in top positions. I want to be entertained, not annoyed and frustrated. Sorry Stephen Amell, I\\'m a fan of yours but you have to speak up to the producers and writers, they are failing you. I was kind of sketchy when I first heard about this series, considering the terrible job that was done with \\'The Cape\\'. I\\'m pleased to say that all of my doubts were unfounded. Arrow is a darn good show, and the first Pilot episode is very strong and leaves little confusion behind this vigilante\\'s origins. I felt that the main actor properly conveys a somber and mature attitude in contrast to the description we receive of him as a partying playboy before the shipwreck. The action is intense and not over the top or completely unbelievable. What we\\'re presented with is a young man whose 5 years spent on an island have shaped him up into an agile warrior tasked with cleaning up his city from corruption. I can\\'t wait to see what lies in store through future episodes, and I certainly hope this show delivers the goods. So far, I believe we\\'re in store for some quality television this fall. I have seen all 23 episodes of Arrow, and honestly I\\'m pretty impressed. I believe this is inspired by Nolan\\'s Dark Knight trilogy, but I don\\'t think that it\\'s a ripoff. For me, the show is never boring. It is like the combination between teen drama and the Dark Knight trilogy. Speaking of realism, this show is not realistic at all. Oliver with Diggle and Felicity seem to have any solution to every kind of problems, well it doesn\\'t matter at all since this is a comic book adaptation. As much as I love this show, I still think the show is so flawed. The cast aren\\'t that good, well they are okay. Sometimes what really bothers me is the dialogs, it is so f-in cliché. The dialog is so fake that\\'s filled with cheesy words that we\\'d NEVER say in real life. What I like most about the show are the action and the plot. The plot is very good, the crimes never seem to end, and I loved every episode in the series.As much as how flawed the show is, it\\'s pretty darn entertaining. It\\'s obviously not Breaking Bad or game of Thrones, but it\\'s one of the most entertaining shows in TV today.! Let\\'s take a moment of mourning for the TV plot arcs of yore. Back when shows prioritized the characterizations above the action and, if indeed there was action, it took place precisely in the last 7 minutes of the episode, and was all done with before the close, giving the characters a chance to make light comic banter, close down the storyline, and give the audience a chance to go to the toilet. How many TV shows followed that formula I cannot say, but the number was in the 100s. Now all that has changed. You can now have action many times in the body of a show, it is permitted, even encouraged. And you have action even before the characterizations are fully developed. All this is positive evolution I think. But here the catch. There are no more \"closed\" story-lines. In the multi-band, multi-channel, multi-device electronic age, where viewers tend to have attention span of a hummingbird, nighttime TV has astonishingly borrowed the Rule Book of daytime soap operas and, lo!, plots never actually resolve, they just become more complex. ARROW is one of the best exponents of the new type of comic-book-derived drama, arguably as good as or even better than SMALLVILLE (which was, thematically, all over the map). Amell is great. He has a whispery kind of delivery which oddly makes what he says that much more interesting. The supporting cast is great. In fact the only thing that prevented me from giving this a \"10\" are the flashbacks. They are terrible. They are like some silent Hell the viewers must go through to get back to the actual episodes. It is almost as if the lead writer, as a small child, was locked in a closet with a DVD looping KUNG FU, and grew up to believe that you cannot advance 10 minutes of plot in the present, without 2 minutes of flashback to fortify it. (This review is written after having seen episodes 1-6 only) Who the hell decided to give the green light for this series in this state? Honestly, the people who made this must have never read a comic book in their lives.First off, let\\'s get the good things out of the way: the plot is very promising and so far it\\'s the only thing that keeps me going, and the cinematography/effects are not bad, but they could use a little polish here and there, especially the choreography of some fight scenes. (2 stars from here) Now what is wrong with this series? They failed on every level to deliver us a show about a superhero. They took the idea of the Green Arrow and crapped all over it.Firstly, the Green Arrow is supposed to be an incredibly stoic and cynical character when he is monologuing, with a witty tongue reserved for his foes. Someone who used to be a very naive young man once, but who was slapped in the face with the realization that the society around him is rotten to the core. So he sets off in a crusade to even the balance between the poor and the rich and bring some justice to his corner of the world with only his excellent archery skills as a weapon, as a modern-day Robin Hood. Now, the background story the series shows about him being stranded on the island shows this very good. However, his monologues are not as thought-provoking, philosophizing or caustically cynical as they appear in the comic books. I will give the actor though another star because after watching the first couple episodes, he is honestly trying to improve his character and deliver his poorly-written lines in an Arrow-like manner. Kudos to you sir for actually caring! Secondly, alas the efforts of one person are overshadowed by the failures of the rest of the acting crew. Plastic dolls posing in shop windows have better acting skills than this lot. First and foremost is the annoying ex-girlfriend Laurel whatever-her-name who delivers her lines in the most crude way possible. I can see her thinking trying to remember what she\\'s supposed to say or what emotion to show in her face. It\\'s like watching a baboon school play. The writing of her character doesn\\'t help either. We are supposed to accept that AFTER 5 YEARS she is still in love with the guy who cheated on her WITH HER FRIGGIN SISTER, and who is responsible for her death? And how about his mother that apparently killed her husband, but threatens to raise hell if a hair of one of her family is even touched.And then we come to the third and most crucial failing of this series. This is supposed to be a series about a superhero. I don\\'t care at all about the sex life of his ex-girlfriend, I don\\'t care about the sister\\'s drinking problem, I don\\'t care about the social life of anyone. Partly, because they fail as characters, but mostly because this is a series about a SUPERHERO. This isn\\'t the Days of Our Lives, or Sex & The City. I\\'m not expecting to watch romantic crap about women on their period. I\\'m expecting to watch a superhero kick ass, bring justice to the wicked and perform some general pwnage. Don\\'t get me wrong, I can understand showing how his actions to hide his alter ego affect those around him and how in turn he is affected himself, I like to see some inner conflict in my super heroes. What I don\\'t like is the Green Arrow being a supporting actor in his own series. An average episode goes about 40 minutes and 30 of those are spent showing us uninteresting flirting between his friends and family, then the Green Arrow steps in the room and says he has to go (to fight bad guys) but instead of following him, we are stuck for another 4-5 minutes to witness the constant crying of his friends and family of how he never spends time with them.I DON\\'T CARE!!!! Seriously, imagine watching a series about Batman, that all it does is show Catwoman talk to her girlfriends about how she is in love with a really cute guy called Clark Kent (yes Clark Kent, that\\'s how messed up Arrow is).A terrible effort and an outright insult, don\\'t waste your time, at least for now.It\\'s still pretty early in the production (only 6 episodes so far) and as I said the plot seems interesting. Perhaps the CW network will come around to realizing how much more they could do with this series and improve it later on in the season. One can only hope. Season 3 was mediocre, but season 4 has a huge drop in quality (shoutout to Marc \"Franchise Slaughterer\" Guggenheim). If you are a fan of the series, do yourself a favor and stop watching. The Flash is really hitting it\\'s stride if you\\'re desperate for CW superhero shows. This season of Arrow is just a crudely stitched together collection of tumblr fanfics. The characters have lost any real personality, and just serve to move the plot forward (this season is plagued by writers using half- baked concepts to push the \"plot\" forward by brute force). They frequently make decisions that defy any form of logic as well as any character traits of note. Any development that the characters have made in the past seasons has just disappeared, seemingly because they oppose Guggenheim\\'s Mary Sue couple. Also it would be a misconception to think that the villain is the basis of any overarching plot. He\\'s just a side note to said couple. Really this season seems to lack any direction whatsoever. It\\'s like the writers are giving up on trying to provide any cohesive story. And to make it worse, while they could look back to some of the source material for some good ideas, they spit in its face in favor of their own rambling mess.As a side-note, I feel that the length of this show has been a huge detractor from the start. Even in it\\'s glory days, the seasons probably could have been trimmed in half or lower and tell the same story. A lot of the time on this show is wasted on silly stuff, and could it could be a huge improvement to trim down the story to something more concise and save more for the effects budget. But honestly, is nobody in the studio checking up on them? Was this really looked at and approved by real people in the entertainment business? It boggles my mind that this could make it to air on such a well known show. The CW\\'s superhero shows have always been aimed at a more \"teeny\" audience, but at the levels that Guggenheim has taken it to, it seems like he would be better off writing those fanfics and letting someone with moderate respect for the story\\'s integrity take over. I love the actors in this and wish them the best, but the only hope I can see for this show is to retcon this season and get a fresh team of writers because this may be the biggest train wreck I have ever witnessed make the air. Save yourself the time with this one unless your less than about 12 years old or have a very low IQ.It\\'s like the ideas been pieced together from other shows. It\\'s stupid, inconsistent, hypocritical, ridiculous, and most of the acting is terrible.It\\'s a pity because the underlying story with the mother and her associates is the shows only redemption. You just have to sit through the agony of the rest of the show to get this. Maybe they should save us all the heartache and just tell us what happens with that story line. OK, just seen the first episode and I think it was amazing. I am not the biggest fan of comics or very knowledgeable about Green Arrow in general, so I feel I can be very objective in reviewing this show like I would any regular one, without fan-love ideas or huge expectations. The characters seem very believable so far, few minor doubts here and there but nothing crucial; acting also up to part. Story is realistic, without that fantastical loop holes that comic adaptations usually have (was told Green Arrow was like that in comics too, so I respect the decision to stay with that). CGI was decent, compliments to stunt collection and fighting choreography (well done, sir, well done), and quite good screenplay for this episode. The makers opened quite a few questions, made room for many ways show can stream to; I can say without a doubt, that this show is one of the surprises of this fall and I can only hope that the whole season lives up to this great pilot. I\\'m not sure why Arrow has an 8.1 rating, pretty high for an overly boring, almost laughable show.First of all, why does Oliver always seem to feel the need to have sex with every woman he encounters? Second, why does everyone come back from the dead? And third, why does every villain they come across somehow related to the island Oliver was stranded in for five years?Don\\'t get me wrong. I do like the concept. I\\'m sure this would have been an amazing show if the script, or the plot, or the actors weren\\'t so horrible. I find myself always laughing at the dumb things the characters say/do. The plot doesn\\'t make sense at all, there\\'s nothing remotely interesting or not ridiculous in it. And the characters are just as laughable. How did they cast these actors exactly? Was there even an audition or were they just going for the prettiest faces that came their way?This used to be a good show, the first few episodes were good, that is. Somehow, it took a turn for the absolute worst. Like many others here. I thoroughly enjoyed season 1, 2 and 3 was alright. 4 was where it really went down hill with poor plot and acting which overall lost the more gritty feel to arrow. Season 5 however really brought it back for me with an amazing villain and interesting plotline. Despite this I dropped out midway season 6 as again the story became sloppy, repetitive and uninteresting which is a real shame for a show that really does have it\\'s high points. Highly recommend just watching through to the end of season 5 and leaving it there. Probably just watch a season recap or something on season 4 as its really not worth the watch. I\\'ve watched all 7 seasons of arrow, and its been quite the journey, but the quality has been dropping with each new season. I can no longer justify spending my time watching this show, as it just isn\\'t good anymore. Nothing about story is interesting, no good villains, plots and schemes. Everything is predictable. ...this show is almost indescribably bad. It makes me angry just to think about.Caveat: I don\\'t know a whole lot about Green Arrow. His name is Oliver Queen, he gained his skills while marooned on an island, he\\'s rich, and he is SO EASY to make fun of. But this isn\\'t an attack on the concept. I\\'ve seen sillier concepts work out to be much better shows.Arrow is one of those shows where wooden acting, poor directing, and writing about on par with the Twilight Saga come together to create one of the most offensive television experiences I have ever had. And I\\'ve seen Jersey Shore.Stephen Amell as the titular hero Green Arrow and Katie Cassidy as Laurel are particularly bad, with approximately one-and-a-half facial expressions between them and a penchant for removing themselves from the room as the standard method of showing anger. You could make a drinking game out of it, truly.The writing is staggeringly awful. However, when I say \"writing,\" I\\'m not speaking about the plot. That might yet unravel over time, but it\\'s too early to tell. What I mean is the actual words which come out of people\\'s mouths. There is a specific scene which comes to mind where Oliver and his best friend, Tommy, are seated at a table, discussing their friendship. Tommy reveals that he\\'s been sleeping with Laurel, and Oliver\\'s only reaction is, \"That\\'s okay, I forgive you.\" I closed my eyes for this scene and realized that I could not even tell who was saying what at certain points. They have no verbal mannerisms, and the \"funny\" best friend has no real sense of humor that I could discern. Plus, his jokes plain suck, but I guess that\\'s a minor point, all things considered. I should point out that, recently, a friend told me that Tommy Merlyn turns into Green Arrow\\'s nemesis, which means they of course have a lot in common and might seem like the same person at times. But that doesn\\'t really come across as purposeful on this show.The directing is maybe the worst offender, here, because a good director could turn cruddy actors and poor writing into something downright entertaining. Just look at Sam Raimi\\'s work on Spider-man 1 and 2. Instead, I find myself imagining David Barrett or John Dahl or any number of the other directors on this show, sitting there texting while scenes are happening. Maybe eating a sandwich or something. Not paying attention must be hungry work.I\\'m getting into a lot of detail, so I\\'m just going to cut this off and say that I should have seen it coming. Just look at the promo picture. Really consider it. That was the very first thing we were shown regarding this series. Ask yourself what that says about their priorities. The universe of Star Trek has done something brilliant to keep alive.  The creators have imposed a story arch for all the series starting with DS9. Don\\'t get me wrong.  TNG was what got me into Star Trek in the first place. It had vibrant characters, unique ideas, and was the building block for setting the stage for the other series and the later movies.  However, in all it\\'s glory, it lacked something.  Continuity.  The longest the crew of the Enterprise D would have to deal with an immediate situation, was no more than 2 episodes.  No doubt things would reoccur, but it was seldom. Voyager, however, would have numerous back to back episodes dealing with something.  And that might even resurface somewhere down the line.\\nI can\\'t understand what people dislike so much about this show.  They explored so much more than any of the others.  Not just in the unverse, but with the crew.  They all grew.  Some more than others, but you can\\'t go 7 years and not show growth in a character.  And as with every other Star Trek, it was rough at first, but it gets so much better once the writers and the actors have about a year or two to get it right.I truely believe that if people give it a chance and don\\'t jump on the bandwagon, they\\'d like it.  It\\'s easy to say you don\\'t like something if you\\'ve never really given it a chance. If IMDB had a way of getting a blood pressure reading on some of the users making comments for this show, the results would be frightening.  There\\'s no reason to EVER get that worked up over a program!  I\\'ve never been able to understand why a person would watch an entire seven year series, hating it all the way.  Option: Turn the channel.  You\\'ve got nothing to lose.  It\\'s not like in the theater where one might sit through a tepid movie because they paid admission.  Voyager was free.  Take it or leave it.Personally, I enjoyed the show.  I liked the plot, the cast, and most of the storylines.  I appreciated the mix of drama and action.  Voyager, in my opinion, was a very good program.  Had I not felt good about it... I would have turned it off.  Problem solved.Not every series is going to be a masterpiece.  Not everyone is going to like every show.  If it\\'s your cup of tea, drink it.  If not, put the cup down. I had to respond to someone who said this was the worst of the franchise. I happen to favor DS9, but Voyager has many great qualities including cast and unique plots. Captain Janeway was an excellent addition to the captains of Star Trek. Let us not forget the criticisms that James Kirk had during the beginnings of his work in Star Trek. The ensemble worked well together, slowly but surely over seven seasons and there were many truly memorable segments. Chakotay, Tuvok, Blana, Tom, 7 of 9, Kes, Harry, Neelix, the Doctor, at the end named Joe, each and every one developed into a character you liked each and every week, irrespective of the episode. They grew even better over time, although I wondered how Chakotay and the Captain never got together and on occasion how Blana and Tom did!and the final episode a two parter was truly a great ending to the show.There is no edge like there is in DS9, just questions on how they are going to get home, and it is the third of this group so it gets compared to ST:TNG sometimes unfavorably. But, just as the ensemble was great in each, so as it is in Voyager. If you take the time to watch the first season you will want to see each and every episode and feel badly when it all ends. Wanting more that is just not forthcoming.Criticize if you will, but the current Enterprise could take some notice of the great ensemble of the previous Star Trek\\'s and the wonderful writing that kept many turning in week after week and continue in syndication.I just recently purchased the full seven seasons on DVD and saw it again after its television airing. The show is even better than when I first wrote about it. Each show stands alone with compelling story lines that are creative in their design and resolution. The franchise of Star Trek- from its inception in the 60\\'s through Voyager should continue in some form other than conventions. There is a void for good stories, writing and ensembles. Contrary to what many Trek nerds would have you believe, Voyager is not the worst Star Trek series, and is not at all a bad show. The acting is superior to that on the beloved The Next Generation (that comment alone will probably have people throwing their Spock ears at their monitors), and I think many of the stories were better. TNG stories always seemed to revolve around spacial anomalies and holodeck malfunctions, which became excruciatingly boring. I wasn\\'t interested in seeing Picard dressed up like Sherlock Holmes and trying to solve a fake mystery, only to be trapped on the holodeck and have the safety mechanisms shut off. As many times as this happened, I would have shut the silly thing down and prohibited its use.Voyager was so great because it truly put its protagonists into a situation that they could not extricate themselves from. For the first time since the original 1960\\'s series, Star Trek characters truly went where nobody had gone before, discovering new races and acquiring knowledge. And they couldn\\'t call on the federation to save them.And no doctor has ever been as good in his role as Robert Picardo. That even includes DeForest Kelly, who was exceptional. Jennifer Lien was also outstanding as Kes, who was very much missed after her departure from the series.Voyager brought back a lot of the adventure that was inherent in the first Star Trek series, and was lost in TNG. Perhaps it didn\\'t live up to its enormous potential, but it was still a very good series that is, unfortunately, far to often the target of hate by TNG purists and people who like to pick at microscopic details. Here in The Netherlands, Star Trek Voyager was on the TV every 4 days of the week. I\\'ve never payed much attention to this since I am not the biggest fan of since-fiction and sorts of movies and series like it. One day, nothing was on and I decided to lower myself to the \\'level\\' Star Trek was on. From that moment on, I didn\\'t knew what I was saying before!I began watching it every day, until I discovered I dropped right there in to the middle of Season 4. Which was pretty bad for me. Since I had NO clue what so ever how they got to the Delta Quadrant, where in war with the Kazon and who \\'Kes\\' was, I decided I just had to afford the \\x8099,99 euro 7parts DVD box. This box was kept in storage somewhere behind my schoolbooks, until I missed a couple of episodes because of my weekly and daily responsibilities. I decided to start all over again and watch the entire series without subtitles or synchronization. Pure all-American humor and language that is.From that moment on, I knew what was going on, and how they got where they were. Including what happened to them. I didn\\'t gave up watching Star Trek Voyager on TV, since there were still subtitles included on TV. It simply drew me back in all over again! (which I didn\\'t mind at all) My initial misgivings suddenly disappeared and I began to be a huge fan of the series. I used to stay up all night watching it and I still do! After watching every single episode more than 3 times. Since I haven\\'t gotten into all the other series, Voyager still raised above my expectations and for sure it amazed my how \\'modern\\' it was for that time of year.Therefor I want to conclude; everyone who is interested in SF, star traveling, interesting plot-twists and more, should definitely watch this series! I gave it a definite 9+. It was great! Some blah episodes, like all trek, but great when it was great. Do yourself a favor, if you like tng and ds9 watch Voyager Voyager, though different in many ways than other Star Trek series, is nonetheless a great chapter in the Star Trek saga. The characters are well developed, and the unusual situation allows for a creative array of episodes.In the first few seasons, it is obvious that the actors (and directors) are still getting used to the characters they are trying to create. As such, the first season or two is a little chaotic, though there are underlying personal and situational themes. Regardless, the early season are most definitely enjoyable, and provide a good foundation for the seasons that follow.Once the show gets underway, however, the characters are given more shape and depth, and the acting/directing vastly improves. The shows focus on a variety of subjects - interpersonal relationships among the crew, individual moral and spiritual issues, scientific anomalies, and time travel, as well as many other things. Both new and previously used aliens appear in the series, so while there are unfamiliar species (such as the Kazon), there are also ties to the original Star Trek villains.I highly recommend seasons two and four - they stand out as two of the best.Star Trek: Voyager, with its unique cast of characters and unusual mission, is a new way to explore the \"final frontier\". I\\'ve been a fan of the Star Trek series since Star Trek the Next Generation. I used to watch The Next Gen after school and I loved the idea of going off to space to explore new worlds and meeting new peoples. But the one thing that bothered me about the series was all the constrictions that the Enterprise had to go through. There was several shows that had the Federation saying \\'You can\\'t do this, or that!\\' But with Star Trek Voyager you have a smaller ship with only a couple of dozen of people on board in a distant part of the galaxy who are trying to get home. Far away from their family, friends and superiors. The series does an great job at redefining several species and introduces new ones. The cast is great and is always fun to watch Robert Picardo as the Doctor because he gets me laughing all the time. The ship has plenty of interesting characters all growing throughout the series. The Doctor becomes more then just a hologram medical helper and becomes a real member of the ship. Captain Janeway becomes a strong confident captain. Tom Paris, a womanizing troublemaker buckles down with a former hot head, federation hating Klingon. So if you love space exploration then this is the series for you. I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until I saw Voyager accidentally one time on cable. I forgot which particular episode but it was so creative and funny, that I kicked myself for not noticing this treasure. Thanks to the advent of Netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, I am able to embark into every episodes for the entire 7 seasons. What about the doctor!? Emergency Medical Hologram to Emergency Command Hologram, Robert Picardo made me love the show so much, what a joy to just see him perform and struggle with his \"humanity\". He makes me laugh out loud so many times, I had to apologize to my roommate for my uncontrollable outburst. Voyager is my painkiller for breaking out the laughs. It\\'s just so funny sometimes, I can\\'t help it. My wife and I love, Jeri Ryan (Seven) and Robert Picardo (EMH) duet -- \"You are my sunshine\". Their voices so pure, I still hear it in my head. It might be corny to some but Voyager is making a grand statement -- to EXPRESS as humanly possible -- the purest form of unrelentless expression of art -- without restraint -- of music, dreams and holo novels, etc. I have to say, Voyager is a very entertaining series. There are immense creativity into the moral conscience, and interpersonal development within each member of the crew. Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, writers of Voyager gave Picardo the freedom to express beyond anything you can imagined. He is more feeling and more emotional than most organics -- and boy, can he sing! I love the premise for doctor\\'s expansive, self growth, developing, and becoming a valuable member as part of \"the family\" decision in the final 2 episodes of Endgame; science fiction at its best! Toward the end, EMH actually disobey Captain\\'s order and make \"human\" mistakes. I believe the chemistry between the crew works well. Harry Kim and Tom Paris, Neelix and Tuvok <-- those two are actually quite funny. I love Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan. Finally, I\\'m SO GLAD they did not go with the original actress for Janeway-- have you seen the rare 1st episode footage?! -- thank God for Kate Mulgrew! She has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. Let me put it this way, Kate Mulgrew did more than I ever envision a female Captain could do -- even with a hint of feminine quality. Hard to believe but the chemistry balance was just right. Kate, what a GREAT job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy every episode, the creativity, of morals issues we face everyday, and the potential possibilities of our Cosmic expanse. Voyager started off on shaky ground, but gradually levelled off into a good scifi show. It took TNG forever to find its unique niche and identity, and so it is for Voyager. It can be compared to the original Star Trek, in its go-where-no-one-has-gone-before identity.Humor and drama, action and sometimes even horror are well-balanced in Voyager, the characters started off slightly odd but eventually became edgy but fast friends with each other. Even Neelix, the Talaxian who often looks as if he\\'s wearing rejects from Quark\\'s wardrobe, has become a far more palatable and even likable character.If Neelix can make me laugh, then Voyager has its niche. :) This is yet another brilliant Star Trek series, this time the danger  fraught adventures of the Federation star ship Voyager. As a result of  the Caretaker\\'s intervention, Voyager has been stranded in the  generally hostile Delta Quadrant, 75 years travel from Earth, with  little prospect of any return home in the foreseeable future and  initially not even any communication with the distant Federation. The  Voyager crew consists of some likewise stranded Maquis (including  Chakotay & B\\'Elanna) who have been forced to join forces with the  original Federation crew in a mutual struggle to survive and return  safely to the Alpha Quadrant.  Commanding Voyager is surely the Federation\\'s most bold, determined,  decisive, and feisty captain. Kathryn Janeway is a no nonsense lady  who, given the risks inherent in this unexplored new quadrant, is  frequently obligated to arm the photon torpedoes first and seek  diplomacy later. Her stern voice commands \\'Hail them!\\' when hostile  species threaten, generally followed by the even more terse and severe  call, \\'Battlestations\\'. Captain Janeway, who is addicted to black  coffee, has left a fiancé back home on earth.  The Delta Quadrant really isn\\'t a very friendly place. One of the first  adversaries encountered is the Kazon, a brutal race subdivided into  constantly warring factions. The Vidians have an unfortunate tendency  to steal organs from living victims in their attempts to counteract the  Phage, which has plagued their people for centuries. The Malon are the  quadrant\\'s polluters, dumping their garbage of deadly theta radiation  wherever they can get away with doing so. The Hirogen are obsessed with  the hunt, the pursuit of prey, the kill, and the collection of  trophies. Species 8472 hails from fluidic space and boasts five  genders. Most deadly is the ongoing threat of the ubiquitous Borg with  their cubes, spheres, nasty Queen, and disquieting desire for  assimilation.  Janeway\\'s calm, likable first officer, Chakotay, is a former Maquis of  Native American origin. He has a tendency to navel gaze about his  ancestors\\' spiritual beliefs. He & Janeway share a truly touching bond  of mutual respect, friendship, and dependency, unhindered by the threat  of romance... except once when stranded perhaps indefinitely alone  together on a planet, when some sparks fly between them!   Harry Kim is the innocent young operations officer, everyone\\'s  favourite boy next door, homesick for his parents and unlucky in love.  The ship\\'s ongoing romance is between Tom Paris and B\\'Elanna Torres.  B\\'Elanna is the feisty, hot tempered, half Klingon Chief Engineer. Tom  is Voyager\\'s cool, nonchalant, charming pilot / helmsman, who has a yen  for old movies, Captain Proton, rock & roll, fast cars and even faster  spacecraft. Midway through the series he designs a fancy new shuttle  craft, the Delta Flyer.  Tuvok and Neelix are polar opposites. Tuvok, the totally logical,  openly emotionless Vulcan tactical officer, has left a wife & family  back home on Vulcan. Needless to say, he experiences a pon farr during  Voyager\\'s travels! Tuvok\\'s leisure pursuits include meditating, playing  logic games such as kal-toh, and listening to Vulcan dirges. Neelix is  the super friendly, warm hearted, enthusiastic cook and morale officer,  a Talaxian who has lost his family as a result of a devastating weapon,  the metreon cascade, on his home planet. Tuvok appears to barely  tolerate Neelix, but underneath is a touching, unacknowledged  affection. One of the more intriguing episodes sees a transporter  glitch combine Tuvok & Neelix into one individual, Tuvix, with a truly  unique personality mixture of the two.  In my opinion, the only uninteresting crew member is Neelix\\'s  girlfriend, the lovely Kess, despite her developing special powers.  Kess is an Ocampan, a Delta Quadrant race with a short life span, whose  females incubate their young in a sac on their back. Kess is replaced  mid way through the series by the totally compelling and endearing  Seven of Nine, a Borg of human origin, severed from the collective  during the fascinating two part episode, The Scorpion. The beautiful  blonde Seven struggles to adjust to her newfound individuality as she  punches up data in Astrometrics, ever efficient in her skin tight garb  and pausing only long enough to regenerate.   Perhaps the most lovable crew member is The Doctor, actually the  Emergency Medical Hologram, but with more personality than any of the  organic folk! He\\'s a totally insufferable, arrogant, yet very appealing  character who has a brief love affair of his own with a Vidian doctor.  He also sings opera and has something of a crush on Seven, to whom he  gives dating lessons (definitely Voyager\\'s funniest episode). There\\'s  even a child aboard, the charming little half Ktarian Naomi Wildman,  who was born on Voyager. Neelix reads her bedtime stories, but later  she longs to become Captain\\'s Assistant. Her role model is Seven with  whom she plays kadiscat.   New technologies introduced in the series include Voyager\\'s bio-neural  gel packs. Needless to say, the crew frequently encounter false leads  that promise a quick trip home to the Alpha Quadrant. A number of their  adventures involve disruptions in the time line. The most compelling  time related episode is the two part Year of Hell, involving constant  attacks by the Krenim time ship with its devastating temporal weapon.  At the heart of the series is the crew\\'s camaraderie in its assorted  struggles to return to the Alpha Quadrant. Their goal is challenging,  but it\\'s the journey that counts. My sole complaint is the show\\'s  occasional intrusion into the theological realm with the Klingon  Messiah, Klingon hell etc. Otherwise, it\\'s a wonderful & unique science  fiction series with a stellar cast. Finally, my compliments to the late  Jerry Goldsmith for his amazing theme music. I call it the music of  longing to go home. As was true with Star Trek Deep Space Nine, as the Star Trek Voyager series progresses, the episodes keep getting better and better!! Seven of Nine\\'s quest to regain her humanity, and the Doctor\\'s similar \"voyage,\" although he\\'s not technically human, are captivating as their characters continue to develop over the course of the series. Their relationship is also a tantalizing aspect of the series. I\\'m half-way through season 6 now, and to date, I find \"Someone to Watch Over Me\" (Season 5, episode 22) to be the best episode of the series to date. This episode also includes some of the funniest lines in any Star Trek, ever. I know it\\'s been over 10 years since this series first aired, but I wish to offer my sincerest congratulations to the writers and creators of this wonderful series! Voyager is the best Star Trek series yet, hands down. While that may be an opinionated statement, I reason this by pointing out several key parts of the show which make it more enjoyable than any other series. The cast, firstly, has a lot of diversity and characters such as Janeway, Seven of Nine and the Doctor are extremely engaging throughout their respective seasons. The concept of the ship being stranded thousands of light years away from Earth or Federation space is not simply an interesting basis in its own right, but betters the development of these characters. They are isolated in an unknown region of space with foreign enemies and perils, which forces the characters to grow and adapt. It creates a new level of camaraderie as the Voyager crew depend on their ingenuity, co-operation and resourcefulness to find a way home.While these new aliens and planets may seem off-putting to both newcomers and old fans of Star Trek, the show is grounded nicely by the Federation principles which Voyager upholds. Their journey home is seen also as a mission of exploration, and familiar issues- such as the classic moral dilemma or Prime Directive story- return in different circumstances. However well the writers stick to the tried and tested formula (which is not a bad thing), a whole new quadrant of the Milky Way allows plenty of scope, as mentioned, for new enemies. While the Kazon are quite possibly the least intriguing of these, the disease-decimated Vidiians, hunting driven Hirogen, unmatchable Species 8472 etc are all fascinating. Romulans, Cardassians, Ferengi etc make \"cameos\" too, while the Borg encounters have made Captain Janeway the stuff of legend.The main reason to watch Voyager is that it is enjoyable, just like most Star Trek and like all TV aims to be. It has the real feeling of exploration, revamped and revitalised from the older programmes. The real Star Trek atmosphere is caught up in the lonely but determined ship stuck in the Delta Quadrant, sticking to their guns through thick and thin. Voyager - 7 seasons on DVD. This is a must see. Backgrounds, stories, characters, are all first class. An excellent work of modern TV drama. Following entirely the Gene Roddenberry\\'s vision, this show is indeed a prime derivative. It would be unfair to mention any name in particular. The integration of roles, stories and dialog is remarkable. If you ever liked a sci-fi film then these DVD boxes contain a treasure. From very important social issues, through galactic perils and humor, the crew of Voyager along with its creative team will take you really where no man has gone before. Packaging is robust and typical. All seasons contain extra material. Audio and Video take a 10 in 10. Enjoy the ride in the 4th Quadrant. This is an order. Voyager is over, at least for now.  We all know that no one really dies, or in this case ends, in the Star Trek universe. It has been a fun 7 years. Voyager as been an oasis in a wasteland of television.  It has provided the watcher adventure, romance, comedy, drama and social awareness.  There have been a few disappointing episodes, but that is true with almost every show. On the whole, I think that Voyager has lived up to the Star Trek name and furthered Mr. Roddenberry\\'s dreams.  I\\'ll miss Voyager and her crew.  But I would like to thank the \"powers that be\" for a happy ending. To me, nothing can approach the goofy, paper mache rock flinging greatness of the original series. Voyager, however, is a close second due to the ever evolving character relationships and story lines that center around entire (fascinating) command staff rather than being \"The Starfleet captain show\" or occasional focus on one or two main characters. Speaking of Captain Janeway, i simply cannot understand how a few consider the character or the actress \"weak\". ST Series best to worst IMO- Star Trek, Voyager, Star Trek TNG, Enterprise, Star Trek TAS, Disappointment 9 Voyager can be said to be a science fiction version of Homer\\'s story of The Odyssey with Captain Janeway as a female version of Odysseus. The crew of Voyager face the same adventures that Odysseus and his crew did after the Trojan War. Many of the episodes reflect the myths of the of The Odyssey especially the one where the planet of women that capture men to drain them of life such as Ceres did to the crew in the novel. Much like other Star Trek series\\' each episode is more-or-less self contained, in that it has little to no effect on future episodes as they\\'re exploring other worlds or space phenomenon, but there is one constant, they\\'re trying to get home. As good as The Original Series or Next Generation were, they never had any underlying storyline as Voyager does.\\nI like the point of choosing Voyager for the journey, it\\'s a ship that can just about manage the long distance at a good speed (other lesser space-craft in the Star Trek universe would be too slow making thier journey seem unrealistic and virtually unattainable) and the brilliant crew work well together.But the best part of Voyager is that it shows that Star Trek is not JUST Enterprise (we have done three series\\' with Enterprise as the major space-craft so it\\'s nice to see them move on, I recognise that Deep Space Nine had the namesake space station and the small craft Intrepid, and now there\\'s Discovery with its namesake craft)I enjoyed every episode of Voyager and though the storyline was well made, especially in the latter, Seven of Nine, seasons with the Borg. I have a particularly strong attachment to this show and can honestly say it is my favorite in the whole Star Trek universe. I started to watch it from day one all the way to the end even though it took a while for the series to fully realize its potential. The first 3 seasons were good but nowhere near as great as the show would become later yet I hung on, hopeful that something better would come along and then boom, Seven of Nine appeared.The show only started to become really wonderful when Jeri Ryan was added to the show with Scorpions at the end of the 3rd season as the cliffhanger for season 4. Somehow, I really connected with this particular character and from then on, they could do no wrong or at least, they could always count on my loyalty to watch. Sure the writing is uneven in places and some episodes are not as great as others but it\\'s true for any series.I have to say that the number one reason why I connected so strongly with this series is this particular set of characters. Somehow, it all gelled so well and even though I have favorites of course like Seven, The Doctor and Janeway, they all had something interesting to add to the mix and the chemistry always worked for me, even in sub par episodes. But thankfully, even the lowest rated episodes have something interesting to offer.I was particularly satisfied with how the series ended, the perfect conclusion to one heck of a journey and I still miss it to this day even though I can always watch to my heart\\'s content any time I feel like it. This is connected with a great time in my life and I will always remember if fondly.A strong 9 stars is well deserved and the 1 star is deducted from the perfect score only because the writing is sometimes not as strong as it should be, especially with episodes not connected to the Borg or Seven of Nine. But still, every single show has something to offer and this series remain one of the very best I had the pleasure of experiencing as it ran for 7 successful seasons and I could not recommend it enough. OK, the last season was a disappointment, no arguments here. up until that point however, this was a pretty darn good show. season four was my personal favorite. with episodes like nemesis, year of hell and living witness, (the revisionist history point could have been used again)who could not like this show. it was episodes like those that made this show true, poignant star trek. Get the season four DVD! it is awesome as has the most of the most skillfully crafted written, directed, acted, shot) episodes of this show or Ds9.For the first two years, they couldn\\'t seem to get the marquis thing out of their (the writers) head\\'s, but for the most part this was OK. the episode where Paris\\' little act was revealed and Alliances more that made up for learning curve (Tuvoks boot camp) and parallax where Torres first became chief engineer; which actually was a necessarily rough episode, being the first one after the premiere. The characters developed gradually over time but each of them developed steadily and at their own pace; even Tuvok, who at first was so terribly stolid/stoic.things actually started to wane plot-wise around the 6th season. most were still watchable but they lacked drive and intensity. Muse, fury and blink of an eye (was that a 6th season?) were pretty great though. who determined that every star trek set in this century needed 7 seasons anyway? that is how disappointing season 7 feels to many people: it never should have happened. I can\\'t believe (or can hardly believe) what they did to some of the main characters during that season. (thinking mainly of author author-like episodes here.) but everyone had ample amounts of episodes in the spotlight and most had ample time in episodes that were focused on others; here is what set voyager apart:everyone got significant time on-screen well, that\\'s about it. save that Janeway did at times seem bi-polar and the whole thing about getting home (the restart button?) got pretty old eventually. that\\'s one thing that set timeless apart: time-travel, good Kim episode, voyager didn\\'t get home but ended up getting closer to home. the show had many individual episodes on all points on the rating scale. over all, 7 out of 10 points Star Trek: Voyager is a great series to watch. The initial concept of the show is pretty simple: USS Voyager is taken to the delta quadrant against there will and are stranded there - leaving them no choice to but to embark on a long and dangerous journey home.The Voyager series brings in a lot of new and old ideas about the star trek universe. The new idea of having a holographic doctor and being able to send him on away-missions is a very complex and entertaining idea. The idea of two opposing factions banding together to work as one crew is new. However, some old ideas do still remain for example the unattractive uniforms, color designations, button sounds and the weakness of their ship.The cast is full of good actors. At first the characters were green and so was the acting, but by the second season the characters and acting seemed to flow much better. Captain Jane-way certainly looks and feels like a leader and her choices are often made by seeking advice from other crew members, but some of her decisions are startlingly dark and immoral. There were a lot of recurring minor roles for actors and they brought a unique feel to the show.One of the best things I like about this series is that it gets very technical, but is also dumbed-down enough to make sure the ordinary lay-man (like myself) can still understand what\\'s going on. The addition of Seven of Nine was a great idea. Jeri Ryan brought in a great sex appeal and added further to the technical stand-points in the show. I fully enjoyed learning a lot about the Borg. It is one of the species I was most interested in.If you want to know about the Borg, this is the series to watch. Also, this series is very dark. At some points I had shed some tears. Rick Berman was shooting for a darker Star Trek and he made it happen.The points of the show I didn\\'t like was that the ship always seems to have some sort of problem and that shields and weapons are almost always offline or not working. It also seemed like the crew wasn\\'t trained well-enough for combat fighting. After a while it appears as if all combat is turn-based. (If you don\\'t know what I mean think of it this way: One person fires and then the enemy fires and continues back and forth.).By the end of the show itself the writing formats seemed to be predictable. After season 5, each episode seemed to start ending abruptly. Within the last 5 minutes it seems that everything episode or problems gets solved and life goes back to normal without any residual effects. After watching full seasons with that kind of writing, the show starts to get a little tiresome.Overall, this is a wonderful show. It outlines betrayal, morality, trust, honor and integrity. Each episode takes you on journey to learning a new life lesson. I have been watching the star trek shows from TNG to Enterprise and having just finished Voyager I must say I really do love this series. I grew up with TNG so it will always be #1...plus Picard nuff said. Voyager offers a show that\\'s just as good, with a great cast and awesome show dynamics. I do think Voyager should have acquired some better technology from the delta quadrant. Endgame shows voyager as a wicked starship with Borg inspired weapons and Armour but that\\'s it one episode of really good quality new weaponry. I find also the technical aspect of the show was far better than TNG DS9 and Enterprise. They explained things in more detail and ran into truly interesting space oddities coupled with better CG representations. Which is the reason I hate TOS so much, I\\'m not from that time so I really find the visuals and special effects lame and boring. Voyager has the strange distinction of being the first Trek series that I didn\\'t like. To me there\\'s a throughline of complexity that runs from TOS to DS9 and then just stops at Voyager. An intriguing premise is spoiled early on with pretty much all the Maquis conflict resolved within 4 episodes. The \"unfamiliar\" Delta quadrant ends up being populated with species that are largely derivative of other races already seen.Lacking imagination the writers sought to shoehorn as much of TNG\\'s cast offs into the show as possible: Lieutenant Barclay, Troi, and how could we forget the Borg. One of the biggest mistakes the show made was to return to the Borg well too often. Every time we learned something new about the collective their power and presence was compromised. How many times can a poorly equipped science vessel defeat them before all menace is removed? Voyager lacked originality and never strove to bring anything different to the franchise. The characters lacked any real sparkle and the episodic nature of the show ended up making a number of characters look schizophrenic, especially Janeway, who see-sawed in her behaviour depending on what the episode called for. This was further compounded by Kate Mulgrew whose goose-like voice, overexpressively constipated facial expressions and robotic body movements made watching a disbelieving experience.The biggest downfall of the show was that the solution to everything seemed to be technology, especially Borg for the last few seasons. The solution to problems being the pressing of buttons did not make for high drama.Voyager had the occasional excellent episode, usually the 2 parters, and it did have some good actors amongst the cast, though the parts they played rarely gave them the opportunity to display this.Voyager is regarded as the beginning of the end of Trek, being less popular than its predecessors and less well regarded critically than what had come before. Voyager, like Enterprise, failed to keep pace with the wider changing TV environment to which shows like DS9 and Babylon 5 were early adopters (and maybe even trend setters - there would be no programmes like 24 or Lost without shows like these). It isn\\'t so much a bad show as \"bad by comparison\". Great show- \\'almost\\' the best start to finish show of all time, but it has some slow patches in early seasons before it becomes really awesome and like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and gives each season a clear beginning/end and unique concept to a story-line and really starts cooking. One of the best finales to a show, and a perfect wrap up that none of the other Star Trek shows (or many shows) have ever achieved to date. Perhaps the last of the sci-fi series saga that portrays future in glorious light and not try to bring future down to \"man\" size like so many of the sci-fi series that came since then (including Star Trek\\'s own \"Enterprise\" series). The characters, the special effects, the production design are of highest creativity and beauty, something epitome of sci-fi has strived for since first sci-fi appeared on screen.I\\'m not sure why sci-fi characters started getting merged with working class heroes in recent years, but this only shrinks the genre in my opinion. If this series was the swan song for the beautiful portrayal of our future, I think the loss is great.As a die hard sci-fi fan, this series was the last of the great sci-fi epic. If you see that the subsequent series \"Enterprise\" became the first Star Trek series to be canceled due to poor ratings, I believe that there is still a market for great sci-fi epic like the Star Trek Voyager.In my opinion this was the best of Star Trek series with best production design, and character portrayal. I would love to see more Star Trek series continue in this vein and I hope other sci-fi series will follow suit.'],\n",
       " 'TeresaP': ['We knew already that Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision and the craftsmanship to go with it. Extraordinary battle scenes. Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield\\'s eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love! As someone from Sydney, Australia I was proud at the way this was filmed. Using the Hollywood model, there would have been lots of sets but using actual buildings allowed a lot of warmth to come through in the natural light. Gibson is a fine director, I was impressed with his framing, he shoots very closely for the acting stuff (more head and shoulder) which is quite interesting on the eye. Using more natural light it is quite beautiful. I suspect Gibson will not yet have been forgiven for his personal life to get the recognition he deserves.This movie could have been another Forest Gump, it could overly sentimental, instead, carries an appropriate amount of sincerity. The backstory is a major part of the movie. Doss is portrayed as uneasy with the girls who fell for the first pretty thing he saw. This could have been so Forest Gump-like but strikes a nice chord.The cast was excellent. Hugo Weaving was perfection. He carried the first half of the movie as the battle-fatigued (PTSD) WW1 vet father. Some may complain that the women are poorly portrayed as are the Japanese, who are largely like ants coming from their mound or canon fodder.As brutal as the second half is, I am sure it could not convey how truly gallant Doss was or brutal it was in reality. When thinking about war films, it\\'s very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss\\' phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.Hacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It\\'s the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss\\' arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.Speaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you\\'ll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they\\'re wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.Coming to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it\\'s great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.The supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I\\'d see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.Few films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that\\'s why I have to say it\\'s a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It\\'s right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen. I was lucky enough to sneak into a cast & crew screening at the Newtown Dendy cinema. I thought 10.30AM on a Sunday was too early for a Mel Gibson movie, that I might be in for something along the lines of the heavy-handedness of THE PASSION OF THE Christ, and the adrenaline pumped brilliance of APOCALYPTO.I was proved wrong because after the first thirty minutes I wasn\\'t sure if this was a Mel Gibson film when I was placed into a comfort zone, with its melodrama set in a small Virginia town during the Forties, a schmaltzy romance, and the cliché violent drunken father who survived a brutal war. The performances were maybe a little let down by the clumsy dialogue, but all directed safely with a natural sense of storytelling.By the 2nd act, I was put on high alert in the military training with our protagonist, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield who I at first felt was wrongly cast, but he really came through in the end). It was here when the true purpose of the story began to evolve, that of Doss\\' moral and internal conflict with using a gun! What he had to endure and stand-up for was a courage I greatly admired. It was also in this phase of the film that the dialogue and characters began to shine. Maybe it was the introduction of Vince Vaughn\\'s character. We all know how Vaughn is notorious in ad-libbing, and it seemed to help because the other actors bounced off it well.Now the story had me in their pocket because by the 3rd act I was with our protagonist and his platoon when they got to the battlefield graveyard of Hacksaw Ridge. You thought the horrific situation in WE WERE SOLDIERS was brutal, well this was captured so vividly that you felt you were there. It was almost on par with the brilliance of GAME OF THRONES; BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS.Now I felt I was in a Mel Gibson film. As with Braveheart, the battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge didn\\'t hold back. Maybe a notch better because of today\\'s CGI (and I didn\\'t even notice the effects!). The scenes were unflinching, haunting and in your face. Possibly showing you the true horror of war. Definitely not for the squeamish.The religious aspect of the film was relevant to the story, so as a non-believer I thought it was an integral part of the protagonist and had to be told, so it didn\\'t bother me as much.Overall the technical aspect of the film was brilliant, but then again I didn\\'t really notice it because I was too distracted by the story and the characters, and when that occurs, I know the film has succeeded. Just watched this movie at the pre-screening and feel like I owe it to the creators to write a review. Having read other reviews, it is hard to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be surprised if we don\\'t see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss\\'s act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it\\'s place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. Hacksaw Ridge is not a film for the feint-hearted. Right away the opening scenes portray the horror of war, and the emotional journey is only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war-hero Desmond Doss. One of the great feats of storytelling from Mel Gibson (director) and Andrew Garfield (leading role, Desmond Doss) is to lead the audience along Doss\\' journey with a feeling of having experienced the journey as Doss, and experiencing the wide range of emotions endured by this heroic character along his journey.Neither war itself nor violence are glorified in the film, yet they also not derided. The elements of conflict that draw the storyteller – the heroism of overcoming adversity, the bonding of soldiers, and the brave resolve on which soldiers must rely to perform their duty amidst such chaos and terror – these elements are all present, but they placed alongside the horror, the madness and the terror of war, and used to draw in the audience for Doss\\' journey. The lasting psychological impact for those who survive conflict is well told by Hugo Weaving\\'s portrayal of Doss\\' father, whose lines could serve as a mouthpiece for many veterans.The supporting roles add depth, with both script and performance making very few, if any, of the supporting characters two dimensional. Vince Vaughn\\'s excellent turn as Doss\\' training sergeant provides both humour and pathos to bring laughs and pause- for-thought at well scripted points of the tale, allowing the audience to gather their breath.By the end of the film, audience members will leave the cinema feeling tired, worn out by having experienced Doss\\' journey of hope, innocence, love, confusion, anger, faith, and courage. Hacksaw Ridge is in no way a popcorn-lazy-Sunday-afternoon film; it is a journey. With its late release over here in England, by the time the film was released, it had already come to prominence with overwhelming reviews and 6 Oscar nominations to its name, so I entered with relatively high expectations, which I generally find to be a bad call as you tend to be let down, however Gibson\\'s first directorial effort in a decade, \\'Hacksaw Ridge\\', is a raw and emotional gut punch.With the history of cinema being littered with the production of World War II films, primarily in the form of over-the-top propaganda pictures such as \\'Saving Private Ryan\\' (which nonetheless I still love), it\\'s nice to see a movie that delves down the path of anti- war and focuses on the true-life tale of an uncaped superhero over fictional splendour, and \\'Hacksaw Ridge\\' is just that. The film starts with rather over-sentimental, soap opera style tendencies which are occasionally funny to watch, but nonetheless they are perfect at delivering character development to our front-running hero Desmond Doss. I was initially expecting a \\'Pearl Harbor\\' approach, with over an hour of lovey-dovey sentimental crap followed by under-accomplished action, but it was quite the opposite. The opening features the stated character development drama, but gives us an insight into Doss\\'s personal reasons for his faith and religious approaches, then thrusts us into war.Now, the war scenes... well, let\\'s just say they\\'re some scenes I doubt I\\'ll be forgetting anytime soon. They\\'re epic, they\\'re visceral, they\\'re emotional, they\\'re gory, but above all else, they are executed perfectly. Upon reaching the top of the Maeda Escarpment, nicknamed \"Hacksaw Ridge\", the squad are instantly driven into the horrors of war, the loss of friends and hope. The raw and visceral images are maybe even a little too realistic. Dead bodies are strewn across the ground, innards and entrails litter the floor, smoke and fire choke the landscape. This is war.\\'Hacksaw Ridge\\' is a hard-hitting film that if watched and truly understood, will be an unforgettable experience, and the concluding interviews with the real-life Doss add to the emotional core. The cinematography is stunning, the music is beautifully alluring and the performances, especially from Andrew Garfield, are beyond fantastic, Garfield completely embodies the persona of Doss with sheer accuracy. Further shoutouts to Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington and the surprisingly brilliant Vince Vaughn. This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films to have graced 2016... or 2017 here in the UK! We forgive you Gibson! Hacksaw Ridge is the latest film from the infamous Mel Gibson and it is as electrifying as one would come to expect. Telling the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. The untold story of Doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell. Starring Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Teresa Palmer, Hacksaw Ridge is a beautifully acted and viciously portrayed war film that will stick with you from the minute the film starts until the second the end credits start. It will leave you clawing your seat, wiping away the sweat from your palms as we see Garfield\\'s Doss save as many lives as he possibly can while dodging bullets and hand grenades. The film starts in the most somber of times in American history, the second world war. Desmond Doss, the son of a PTSD-riddled alcoholic Army man (Hugo Weaving) who served in World War I, is also as much as a devout Christian as he is a patriot, leading him to join the fight against the oppressive Japanese military. Doss is in love with a small town girl Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) who is scared that she\\'ll never see Doss again, especially after the persecution he is sure to face. When in training camp, Doss refuses to touch a gun and is actually court marshaled for his refusal. This leads to a trial in which he is allowed by his superior officers to go into Okinawa with no fire arm to protect him. Much of the film is steeped in realism, something that Mel Gibson specializes in when it comes to violence. While the story and plot line may sound very traditional, the way it is portrayed is a fresh burst of life into a tired genre such as this. That, coupled with the amazing true-life story of Desmond Doss being portrayed on screen, makes Hacksaw Ridge a wild and brutal trip down the path to Christianity and the power that faith can give a man. Gibson, a devout Catholic himself, would be the director to bring this story to life. His religious views seep through his very being, especially through his films and this film is no exception. The film settles in the idea that God is literally protecting Doss, not only physically but spiritually as well. Doss is constantly tested throughout the film, almost needing to take a life (which is the ultimate sin to him) in many scenes. The fact that this man did not fire a single round and saved as many men as he did is astounding and the film really does an amazing job at showing the harsh realities of war but also showing the good that can be brought out in a man through his faith. The film itself, is one of Gibson\\'s less preachy works which makes it more accessible. Even if faith-based films are not your thing, you can appreciate the craft that went into making this film. Hacksaw Ridge displays war as atrocious as it truly is. There is blood, there is gore and there are a couple wounds that will cut even the strongest of men down. This is an extremely violent film but it is extremely violent in the sense that there is enough going on around us to never make us truly settle in the violence which would take away a lot of the impact that Gibson is trying to portray. The film is paced very nicely and does feel more like a traditional war film without it really being the traditional World War II film. The filmmaking is traditional but the story is unique and is definitely the driving force to run out and see this film. The performance from Andrew Garfield is amazing. He sheds any sort of preconceived notion and really embodies the roll of Doss quite well. He is far from a revelation but he is on the right track in delivering a very fine performance. The screenplay is tight and taught. Like I said, there are scenes that are heart pounding in this film. Personally, I found myself holding my breath during some of the action sequences. It was THAT intense at parts. While I do have great things to say about this film, I will say, I was a bit disappointed in the performances all around. While I thought Garfield did an amazing job carrying a film that was not Spider-Man, I wish he was a little better. I felt the same way with the rest of the cast. The melodrama that is portrayed very early on in the film is something that does begin to corrode the realist efforts of everything else. However, once the action starts, so does the really great acting on everyone\\'s parts. Gibson is an actor that revels in the moments of pure chaos and he expects the same thing from his actors. It makes for some intense scenes that are elevated by the pure realism that the actors portray. You actually feel as though you are watching these people go to war. It is a testament to Mel Gibson as a director. He really knows how to put you in the moment and Hacksaw Ridge just solidifies his talent. Overall, I felt Hacksaw Ridge was an extremely brutal and visceral war film that brings up questions of warfare, humanity and religion while displaying Gibson\\'s excellent eye for technical accuracy and assaulting imagery. Say what you will about Gibson as a person but as a director he is sharp, gritty and a master at what he does. Good war-films can be very disturbing to watch. The dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find Hacksaw Ridge (2016) one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema. If it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism.The film plays in two halves: the early life and romance of Army Medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the actual Battle of Hacksaw Ridge. Raised in bible best Virginia, Doss had a troubled upbringing under an abusive father. A devout Seventh-day Adventist, he swore never to commit violence or even carry a weapon but felt duty-bound to enlist in the Army. Not long after meeting the one love of his life, nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), he enlisted with the belief that he could serve his God unarmed and without killing enemy soldiers.Branded a coward and bullied to leave, he was eventually granted conscientious objector status and became one of the troops sent to capture Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa of May 1945. While the assault was forced to retreat under overwhelming enemy fire, Doss remained behind and single-handedly evacuated 75 casualties, lowering them by rope from an escarpment over 100 metres high. The Ridge was eventually captured and Doss became one of the most decorated heroes of World War II.The heroism depicted in this story is of such an extraordinary magnitude that it can easily overwhelm any consideration of the film\\'s merits. With an uncomplicated and factual narrative arc, the story rests on two pillars: acting and filming. On both scores, this film deserves high praise. While the early life and romance chapter drifts towards melodrama, Garfield is cast to perfection as the wide-eyed and straight talking man of unshakeable principle and Palmer convincingly plays his adorable emotional anchor. Together with a strong support cast that includes several big-name stars, this is a powerful ensemble that carries the story convincingly.The most outstanding element of this film, however, is its powerhouse hyper-realistic cinematography and spectacular set constructions that relentlessly convey the brutality of war. While it is an outstanding technical production, giving spectacle precedence over narrative is the film\\'s Achilles Heel. One or maybe a few helmeted heads shredded or bodies bayonetted can convey much, but twenty deadens the senses. If ever there was a case where less could have been more, this is it. Otherwise this is a gripping film with forceful storytelling about a remarkable war hero. I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of HACKSAW RIDGE in Hollywood and was impressed. The screenplay is authentically-driven to the last detail and portrays the horrors (and prejudices) of wartime conduct. I knew we were watching an epic film when at the conclusion, the audience was stunned so much so that the applause was delayed.If you consider yourself a true patriot of America, this movie portrays YOUR values in a blessed light. For ONE gentlemen, amidst extremely adverse treatment by his own comrades and even more deadly hated by his enemy to have save SO many men... is simply epic.I watched the advanced screening with members of the military and faith community alike. At no time did anyone retract from the horrors of war or add asinine political commentary. We all understood that soldiers fight for one another before they fight for a cause and that hatred of war is universal; even among soldiers. War films can be a bit hard to sit through, with its graphic depictions of key battles in history, strong themes of power, brotherhood and the effect it has among the world but with Mel Gibson\\'s latest war drama \\'Hacksaw Ridge\\' it manages to be something more that we can grasp it.The true life story of Desmond Doss is finally brought to the big screen, Doss was a US Army medic who served during WWII, but coming from a family with a strong religious beliefs and a father that struggled with the aftermath of WWI (a veteran himself) it lead him to be a Seventh-day Adventist, refusing to bare a firearm and the use of violence against another. His personal choice would affect his country\\'s army and persuaded a court hearing to charge Doss for his personal beliefs and objection to bare arms but despite this, he is given the chance though to fight alongside his \\'brothers\\' in the Battle of Okinawa, a battle which the American forces fought against the invading Japanese in an intense and brutal battle. It is here in this key battle that Doss was recognised as a true hero for his country, as he managed to rescue the lives of 75 soldiers wounded in battle.Gibson returns to the director\\'s chair to helm this true story, giving his touch of humanistic quality, anti-war themes and brutality to the horrors of war to much great detail. The direction is pretty much on point throughout and never goes dull or loses itself during the 2 ½ running time. The first half of the film is about character and what establishes Doss to become a legend that he is known for, while the 2nd half of the film focuses on his role during the Battle of Okinawa and the brutal battle itself. The violence here is given so much detail, not holding back on the horrors of war and the devastating effect it carried on both sides. The production design, sound mixing, editing and scale of the battle is as intense, horrifying and respectful to the details and real life experiences to what we\\'ve read in history books, but it is yet filmed with beautiful and yet brutal detailing that echoes much to Saving Private Ryan\\'s D-Day battle sequence. The 2nd half of the film is much darker than the first half and people will need a strong stomach to handle the graphic depictions of violence and deaths we see throughout, but it does get emotional at times and in the last few minutes of the film, though overall the film is emotional with Doss\\'s back-story, his personal lifestyle and the brotherhood that Doss and his army experience and share on the battlefield.In terms of acting, the cast as a whole is incredible with Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer giving the best key performances of the film. Garfield has come a long way to prove himself as a worthy actor, breaking away from his well known role as Spider-Man prior to HR. To describe his role as Doss, he gives a quality that defines him as a simple man with values in his life while facing a few struggles that form his belief of not bearing violence or firearms. Garfield must have given much study and preparation for the role, as his character\\'s journey from a wise simple man to a hero of his army is given so much heart, emotion and bravery to make the journey of Doss so believable.Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is a film that will leave audiences in state of emotion that describes the horrors of war, the bravery of Doss and his army and a sense of thankfulness to our past ancestors who had lived in a time to fight for freedom and peace when the world was divided. An incredible film that will indeed earn its amount for Oscar nominations and wins in 2017 (possibly for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Production Design, Music Score, Sound Mixing & Editing and Script) alongside other film awards. A must see film if you have studied history at school, have an interest in history or if you love a solid war film that\\'s true to its core. A masterpiece that will not be forgotten so quickly or never will, we both highly recommend it.5/5 Autistic Reviewers For well over a year now I have been waiting with baited breath to see this movie. I have been a fan of Desmond Doss from a child. Having the privilege of the movie being filmed in my neck of the woods, and even getting to watch some of the scenes being filmed and meeting Mel in the process (ever so briefly), escalated my enthusiasm. When you are that pumped and euphoric, you are usually deflated when the moment finally comes\\x85 but not this time.Although there were a few aspects of the story that were not as accurate as I would have liked, I realize poetic licence is necessary in some ways to give the real essence of the story. And truth can be so much harder to believe then fiction sometimes. Mel managed to portray the man Doss so very well. Some people are worried this is a religious propaganda/anti-gun movie and I assure you that is not the message of it at all. However there is no getting past the truth of who he was and it is the reason the story is so powerful. He was a man with an unmovable moral compass and it doesn\\'t matter if you don\\'t point yours in the same direction, you can\\'t help but respect him for his courage, bravery, and unwavering faith. The movie starts laying the background of the man that will be the hero of Hacksaw Ridge. It is both witty and endearing. Andrew Garfield nails the roll as the gentle scarecrow of a man. He is a bit gawky and yet charming. His accent is true to the real Desmond, awkward though it is at times. He really draws you into the character and shows you what a fighter he was, non-violent but a fighter just the same. It is well explained what personal experiences have lead him to his discussion to not touch a gun.Hugo Weaving masterfully plays Desmond\\'s alcoholic dad, battling with his demons from WWI, and Rachel Griffiths plays his devoted Christian mother trying to hold them all together. Teresa Palmer plays Dorothy, a nurse that captures Desmond\\'s heart. Sometimes cheesy, but then again in reality it would have been, and it is very amusing to watch. Teresa\\'s Dorothy is a beautiful and charming addition to the movie.Vince Vaughn plays the roll of Drill Sergeant Howell. He adds humour with his name calling, and humiliation of the soldiers, but is a very genuine - just a guy trying to win a war and keep his men alive in the process - kind of guy. Luke Bracey is a fantastic addition to the cast as private Smitty, the more traditional war story soldier.True to his reputation Mel does not hold back with the battle scenes. The devastation is already extensive and the ground strewn with bits of bodies by the time the 77th arrives. The shattering reality of war is dizzying and full of impact, moving so quickly you can barely identify the characters in a whirlwind of panic, pain and death. But amidst the chaos, Desmond Doss\\'s character is revealed to everyone and even his harshest critics realize how wrong they were about him. Watching the story change from having the battalion hate him so much that they try to have him imprisoned, to refusing to go on the battlefield without him, is so moving and inspiring it leaves \"It\\'s A Wonderful Life\" in the carnage on the hill, getting eaten by maggots along with the dead soldiers Desmond sifts through looking for \"one more\" soul to save. I saw the movie with a number of friends this evening. Of the 10, 3 of us are combat veterans, with a total of 5 wars between us. (2 Vietnam, 2 Desert Storm and a current war in the Middle East veteran.) All the non-combat veterans thought the battle scenes were \"so horribly, so frighteningly realistic.\" Those who have been to war thought they were incredibly cartoon-ish.The tactical mistakes such as bunching up, not seeking cover, bodies flying through the air, artillery explosions obviously gasoline, all the ridiculous yelling, were all so blatantly wrong. It was the worst depiction of battle we ever saw.If the Japanese occupied the top of the \"ridge\" why didn\\'t they simply cut down the cargo netting the troops climbed? Why didn\\'t they throw grenades down on the assembled Americans below? How did the cargo netting ever get there is US troops didn\\'t already occupy the top of the mountain? Vince Vaughn was the Basic Training sergeant, again, best described as cartoon-ish. Peter Sellers as Inspector Cleuseau would have been more realistic.Quite frankly, there is nowhere enough space here to tell you how bad this movie really is.In reality, battle is hell, in some ways worse than what was shown on the screen, but in terms of realism, this movie is atrocious. I begin my review by saying that I respect the history and the events that took place in WW2 and I have the utmost respect for the guys who gave their life for that cause. Having said that, let me tell you my opinion about the movie. And only the movie.Well, first of all I found it dull and uninteresting. The actors were fake. The scenes looked like rehearsals and uncut material. It was split in two half: the first was about nothing (well you could say stubbornness and stupidity because I was made to fell nothing for the main character except annoyed and uninterested) and the second about guts and gore. Did I said the actors looked FAKE? Oh, yeah. But man, oh man that was the main problem for me. The actors looked fake and the entire movie looked like a poorly made joke.The plot was something like this: let\\'s establish the motives, good. Now the cause... good and now the effects. Perfect. Now we can move on. The audience got it. And so on and so forth. Now lets slip in some romance. You can\\'t have a movie without romance. Good, check! Now let\\'s be jerks about it and make his life uncomfortable in the army, check! But hey, he got beliefs, check! ONE BIG CHECK LIST. No emotion, no heart, no nothing. A dead flat feeling.Let me tell you few spoilers from the movie that I found to be really bad.the scene where he meets the guys from the army in the barrack. Why in the hell should you put a naked guy (no brains, just muscles) to do pull-ups naked? Why? Because the target audience appreciate it? Little girls can\\'t watch a movie that has no naked buff guys in it? I can only imagine the guys who made that crap scene: OK, guys I have an idea! We will introduce a stupid character that will do pull-ups naked in the barrack. But why? Doesn\\'t matter, but it will be very funny and in that way we please the target audience. And check that out. We will make him run naked outside the barrack because the sergeant wouldn\\'t let him get dressed and he will be forced to run naked during their exercises. Ha ha, so funny, NOT!.the scene where they fight the Japanese. At some point the tough guy in the unit picks up a half dismembered body to use it as a shield and charged the battlefield killing 20 Japanese. WTF? At that point I was laughing and couldn\\'t believe how bad this looks. Mel is becoming senile.another scene when some doctor got wounded and Dodds wanted to give him plasma and the doctor says \"No, give it to the other guy I don\\'t know!\". And he did. After several minutes we see a scene where Dodds asks about the doctor and another guy says \"He didn\\'t make it. He didn\\'t have the plasma\". And he makes a stupid face and we as the audience understand everything. WOW that was very educating. It was explained to us like we were some retards and didn\\'t understand the sacrifice he made. Very poorly done. Cheap.The battle looked like it was made by acrobats all jumping in spectacular ways, turning, twisting. All was about guts and gore. The more gore the better. Its as if the film was thought to get better with every gruesome scene over and over again. But it got worse. At some point after seeing so many body parts it became a joke. It began to fail and I was made to smile at how stupid this looks. Every scene made me think how the directors were scheming and constipating with ideas that were suppose to shock us until they run out of ideas and they just put more guts, gore and blood. That will shock them.I can continue to rant about this movie as every scene has flaws and doesn\\'t deliver. I wouldn\\'t call this movie an Oscar or even a mention. Mel\\'s only good movie was Braveheart and I stand by that. I cant believe how easy people fall for this violence nonsense mixed with religion and patriotism. Could it be that this a recipe for successful movies? Or we are ashamed to admit this is a crap movie because we are afraid that others will look upon us and accuse us we don\\'t respect history and heroes? Wake up people! Although we have only just nudged our way into February I nominate this as a contender for Worst Film of 2017. It might even win.This is a film of two halves. In fact the transition between one and the other is so abrupt that you could be forgiven for thinking you are watching two different films. The first half is comprised of two acts.Act 1 sees us in Disneyland with a saccharine sweet love story told as only the Americans can do with a plethora of sickly smiles, gleaming perfect white teeth, pretty pastel colours and every damn country boy and country girl cliché in the teenage book of dreamy heart fluttering romance.Act 2 Army training camp. New wet behind the ears recruits and a sergeant major set on making men of them. Familiar territory. You know the score: the recruits will be wheeled out fully formed and ready labelled from the casting department.. The tough one. The farmer boy one. The handsome one. The oddly short one. The goofy one. And the evil one who from the off sets out to make our hero\\'s life a misery. And the signpost also tells you that an hour down the line in this film they will be best buddies. The sergeant major now does what all sergeant majors do in every boot camp film you have ever seen he yells and screams bawls and bellows just half an inch from the face of every recruit. Of course he saves the best of his decibels for our hapless hero.Turns out our hero doesn\\'t want to carry a rifle he just wants to be a medic. So instead of congratulating him on this noble and potentially useful choice of army career he gets bawled out and they treat him like something the sergeant major scraped of the bottom of his size twelve boots.But with the help of his demented dad and his pretty and expertly permed smiling gal our hero escapes a court martial. The gal gives her guy a bible. We saw that coming. Part Two: Our hero and his buddies are gathered at the foot of a cliff. The only way up to Hacksaw Ridge is via a single wide rope ladder. Atop the ridge are approximately a quarter of a million Japanese soldiers. All is quiet. And you can\\'t help wondering why those evil Nips (their term, not mine) haven\\'t simply chopped down the rope ladder or why they are not massed along the top lobbing mortars and grenades down on the troops below.But we have been assured at the start of this epic masterpiece that we are watching a true story so we have to accept that this is how it happened. But that rope ladder still bothers me.However...the troops clamber up the ladder and they are on top of the cliff – and all hell breaks loose after a bombardment from some offshore guns.Now let me state here that I have read about the battles against the Japanese for control of the Pacific islands and am fully aware of the terrible fighting that ensued. The Japanese fought with suicidal recklessness not seen since Medieval times. But in this film that fighting is presented in such an orgiastic way with almost pornographic detail of spilled entrails, pools of glistening blood, severed limbs, decapitated heads, mangled half torsos and spaghetti shredded legs that the suspicion is that the director and writers have intentionally set out to out-gore every war film that has gone before. Every time a soldier looks up a bullet neatly penetrates his helmet and skull. Every time there is an explosion three men are catapulted into the air by some clever hidden device. And then there is more blood and guts and half- men screaming for their moms. The tidal wave of Japs overwhelms the US soldiers and miraculously they all escape down the one rope ladder. It\\'s not shown how they get their wounded down there but hey ho... What of our hero...? Well he is still up top – now alone with the dead and wounded that have been left behind. A few Japs take some pot shots at him but then they all disappear back to their tunnels for some chow.Leaving our hero free to drag the wounded to the cliff edge. This is an heroic task in itself but now he has to get them to safety. He proceeds to lower them down the two hundred feet sheer cliff face. Actually there are only two blokes down there, smoking and chewing the fat. But they do a sterling job sending the wounded back to camp. Oddly no-one thinks to send a soldier or two – or twenty – up the trusty rope ladder to help our hero. They just hang around below waiting for the next dangling hospital candidate.And so it goes on. When our exhausted hero does eventually fling himself down with a rope there just happens to be scores of his buddies waiting for him. Shame they didn\\'t have the balls to go up and help him. But they all line up cinematically so that our hero can be led away.At the risk of upsetting the \\'Special Relationship\\' we have with our pilgrim brothers and sisters on the other side of the pond – and I know my fellow countrymen will understand this – Hacksaw Ridge is just too American. A much better script and a British director would have delivered a subtle, more sympathetic film with less of your usual jingoism and more of the real drama and nuances of war.This is a true story. A story of towering heroism. Real men fighting real battles. But in this mess of a film that story has been reduced to nothing more than a comic book reality. And all concerned deserved better than that. After reading many positive reviews here and elsewhere, I was eager to see this. But to my surprise this turned out to be one of the most overrated movies I\\'ve ever seen. The first half is the cheesiest piece of Hollywood cinema in recent years and the second half contains the stupidest war action ever aside from comedy; it seemed like slapstick to me! I really have no clue how people can rate this highly. A total disaster of a movie! \"I have seen stalks of corn with better physiques.\" Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) Director Mel Gibson is an action genius and along with that compliment, let\\'s add he knows his violence. Hacksaw Ridge is a true and heroic story of the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor for bravery in battle. Brave also could be any attempt to separate the film from its controversial director, but I\\'ll let the film speak for itself.The contradiction is real: Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) was a Seventh Day Adventist who not only refused to work on Saturdays, but he also refused even to touch a gun. Through the intervention at a court martial of his improbably brave and conflicted father (Hugo Weaving), Doss is allowed to serve as a medic under those conditions, proving to all that he could be braver saving men at Okinawa\\'s Hacksaw Ridge than anyone else (75 men as a medic with a flair for ingenious rescuing).Although Director Gibson is best known for his graphic depictions of violence in Apocalypto and The Passion of the Christ, he can also be accused, along with writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan, of clichéd story telling. The film\\'s two parts, at home and at war, follow some pretty trite set-ups such as the mountain boy smitten by the nurse, the call to righteous service, the tough drill sergeant ( a terrific Vince Vaughn, see opening quote), and the sentimental trench dialogue.Yet these flaws work when the story needs them to establish Doss\\'s kind heart, courage, and the essential goodness of fellow combatants as they confess they misread him and his conscientious objection. If you can forgive the almost unreal, lush setting for his youth in Lynchburg, Virginia, and his mooning for his future wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer), then you will enjoy seeing a real hero in a real war.Yes, Gibson knows how to depict action, not just pain, and it helps make Hacksaw Ridge a welcome addition to war films that tell true stories. And lest I forget, welcome back, Mel; you have been redeemed. This was a wonderful depiction of immense courage in the face of adversity--one of the most intensely moving films we\\'ve ever seen. My father was a Marine veteran of Okinawa and I personally really appreciate the research that went into making this great movie. He never shared much of his story with me while he was alive, and though my father didn\\'t see combat in the battle depicted, this movie gave me many insights into what he saw when he was only 20 years old.There were many times during the movie that i was moved to the point of tears, and overall this was an emotionally gripping but yet still entertaining depiction of the horrors of war and the reality faced at Okinawa. HIghly highly recommended. Do not skip seeing this in theaters! This is a sweet movie. It\\'s very very sweet. In fact, it\\'s so sweet that you can almost see the syrup dripping from the screen. And don\\'t get fooled by the colors. This movie has a more black/white feel to it, heaven or hell, good or bad, etc etc.And I\\'m confused. Is this a political movie? I don\\'t know anything about Mr Gibson\\'s political views, but if this is it - I\\'m not buying.Is it a religious movie? If so, what is the message? That it\\'s OK to go to war in the name of God?.I\\'m confused. So...what am I missing. Well, some nuances for starters! We have this clean-cut handsome James-Dean guy and his gorgeous sweetheart girlfriend (this is where the movie is sooo white and happy), and then we have this gruesome war where everything is very very black. And the Japs are evil. End of story. Is it that simple? Hmm...don\\'t think so.This is a hard movie to rate. I give it 1/10 colorful nuances but a whooping 10/10 syrup bottles! And watch out - you might slip on the syrup floor on your way out from the theatre. I saw Hacksaw Ridge last night here\\'s my opinion.... I don\\'t know if that was supposed to be a historically accurate movie, since they had the actual veterans that they interviewed at the end of the movie But it was more like a Mel Gibson snuff film glorifying the act of killing people and some weird Christian stuff too. IF it was supposed to be a historically accurate movie they probably should drop the scene of a BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle) gunner holding a limbless bloody human torso with one hand (like a shield) while running toward a Japanese position and firing the BAR with one hand. The most shocking part was that they stole the scene from Saving Private Ryan!! The Soldier\\'s started throwing 60mm mortar rounds after bumping the bottom of the shells on their helmets. 😑 As if that was done on a regular basis. There were also several grenades having the pins pulled with teeth and lightly flicking them away. (FYI, if you try to do this in real life you will crack your teeth off). ....Followed by flamethrowers that were actually more like Dragon\\'s breath, igniting dozens and dozens of Japanese soldiers. All this occurring on the screen with the audience behind me audibly saying \" Wow \"The actual cool part was when they showed the medic, heroically moving around the battlefield who ended up rescuing 75 men from Hacksaw Ridge. My one beef with this movie was that it is NOT A REALISTIC INTERPRETATION of what actually happened in WWII, in ANY sense This was more of a comedy/ glorifying gore... followed by actual interviews of real life veterans portrayed in the movie... WHICH, seemed to insinuate that everything you just watched was historically accurate. FAIL!!Also casting Vince Von to play a Sergeant 😑 with some opening scenes trying to mimic the full metal jacket humor, all of it.... epic fail and just hard to watch.On a scale of 1 to 10, the option of going to this movie or staying in my room and staring at the wall This was about a 2, and slightly better than staring at a wall... Just when we thought all WWII stories have been told, this film offers an interesting story about a consciousness objector who chose to fight the system by serving in the military anyway as a medic. Mocked as a coward, he proves himself as one of the bravest in his unit. Critics here will state that it unrealistically depicted combat, but unfortunately this is Hollywood, which will use artistic licenses to promote a story. \\nBrian Ghilliotti I wonder what veterans of the battle had to say after watching this movie. There are many moments in this movie that make it look like Marvel\\'s story. Unbelievable. Was there really only ONE rope ladder to climb for ALL American troops? Was there some kind of treaty with Japanese not to touch the ladder and let Americans climb till they reach the top and prepare for an attack? Everyone was just waiting for our hero to finish, ALONE,saving his wounded comrades? I used to respect Mel Gibson\\'s work. Not anymore. Great graphics and high budget, of course. The standard boring music doesn\\'t even matter, after you notice the big bad problem: there is no scenario, absolutely no intrigue or plot, nothing actually happens, there are no negative characters, there is no actual threat or problem to be solved, no twist, no surprise, nothing. So: boring. Predictable. Heroic. Anachronistic. Full of cliché-s. No plot whatsoever. Poor simple guy has small childhood trauma, grows up to be a fine man, goes to war, is a hero. Now, this might be a summary of a great movie; but in our case, it is everything you will find out in this one. There is, literally, nothing else. I am afraid of saying unrealistic as well, because the character was probably pretty much as depicted. Still, the portrayal is anachronistic, quite false. In fact, we have this huge powerful invading American army, smashing through all defenses of the small bad sadistic Japs (as expected) (no surprise here) (difficult to sympathize, but anyway, need to have some baddies around). And here we have an unarmed winning hero saving the poor lives of the poor victors without consideration to his own life, while his mates massacre their enemies all around, and supporting through his actions the whole round massacre, for a not-really clear reason. I mean, we love Gibson and he managed to do some great cliché heroic movies, so I was expecting more from this one. Just ain\\'t. Stop overrating because you were born in America. This does not contain any spoilers. There are a few scenes that are not medically correct so if you spend over 30 million dollars at least hire some good doctors to review what you are doing. George Clooney said you can make a bad film out of a good script but you can\\'t make a good film out of a bad script. How could this film be nominated for best film but not be nominated in the screenplay category (Titanic anyone?). I really wanted to watch this in the cinema and didn\\'t. I made the mistake of buying it on DVD without checking which oscars it was nominated for and now a part of me wished I hadn\\'t.It isn\\'t by any means a terrible film but I didn\\'t feel emotionally involved with the characters not in the same way as I did with \"Saving Private Ryan\". Engaging story with competent acting. No dull moments. \\nI am going to read \\'All Souls\\' triology by Harkness soon.. pretty sure, will be even more exciting to read.The best part is it\\'s not just another magic and supernatural crap, but a perfect blend of history, myths, fiction and romance. What else can one ask for after a tiresome day?It will definitely leave you feeling, \\'can\\'t wait for next episode\\'. A long time since I\\'ve been this excited waiting for the next episode. This show is great. It has great production, good actors, believable fantasy society, the characters are adults (finally) and it grabs attention and holds it. I love it. Beautiful scenery, amazing shots, interesting characters and story. Can\\'t wait to find out more. Every second packed with intensity in this first episode - I\\'m flabbergasted! Ending of the episode left me yearning for more instantly! I haven\\'t felt like this about a series since first time I watched True Blood (not that they compare in any way). Very catching! I certainly hope the rest of the series live up to this first episode! I was so nervous for this show as I had previously read the books by Deborah Harkness but it did not disappoint at all. Yes, it\\'s only the first episode but each and every character was portrayed so accurately and as far as I can tell they\\'ve stuck pretty close to the novel (not completely but enough). So far so good. Even though I\\'ve read the books I was still left anticipating what was to come next and I was fascinated by how they adapted from novel to screen. Hopefully they continue to stick to the novel! Can\\'t for the next episodes!!! I just read the books so they are so fresh in my mind and the series is different; examples characters are very different Ysabeau in the book although Matthew\\'s mother was made a vampire when she was younger not an elderly woman like in the tv series. The story line is loosely based on the books but is also very different. I like the books better but the series on its own is enjoyable if I keep reminding myself it\\'s just based on the book series it\\'s not the same. Worth a watch I know it\\'s just the first episode, but WOW.Gorgeous setting, Great acting. Solid start to an interesting story. Can\\'t wait for more. I made my account because I feel like this really desereves a positive review.As someone who has seen lots, and lots of films & series, but also having my own fair share of knowledge of video editing. I can really appreciate the cinematography of this series. Beautiful scenes and film work with overall great acting and a story that shows a lot of opportunities for this becoming an amazing series.Three episodes in so far, and after every episode I keep on wanting more. I\\'m mostly writing this review because honestly, I want more! I truly hope they can keep up this quality for the rest of the season, and be renewed for a second season. As it\\'s something that I\\'m already looking forward to.TLDR: Great, and beautifully produced. The first thing to say about this production is that it is beautiful to look at, especially in UHD. The dreaming spires of Oxford are without doubt the stars of the show. Unfortunately, although the visuals are breathtaking, the editing is clunky and the writing cliched and lacking in the intensity of the - rather intrusive at times - soundtrack.Matthew Goode is well, good. He\\'s perfectly cast and has all the mannerisms and snark that you would expect of a vampire. Teresa Palmer unfortunately, although she does her best with her stilted dialogue simply isn\\'t believable as an internationally acclaimed academic. The problem with being introduced as the youngest person ever to obtain tenure at Yale, is that you need to act and speak with a level of intelligence and authority that makes this real. Palmer just doesn\\'t have the delivery or the gravitas required, as demonstrated in one of her earliest scenes when she delivers a lecture which sounds like it was written by a teenager who forgot to do their homework and dashed something off 10 minutes before class.The main problem however, is that the opening episode simply tries to do too much too quickly. This would have worked so well as a slow burner, where the characters slowly reveal themselves over the first few hours of the show and we learn about their struggles with the identities they hold. Instead we are spoonfed everything in the first 30 minutes with awful, rushed exposition as the main characters all but point at each other and say \"You\\'re a witch\", \"And you\\'re a vampire\" in the most hamfisted attempt to get things moving forward.I\\'ve never read the books, so I can\\'t comment on the quality of the source material, but I can only assume that given the luxury of several hundred pages the story unwinds in a careful, intelligent and well paced manner. It\\'s a shame that the creators of this show didn\\'t take the same approach. EDIT on Season one finale\\n-1 Point for poor special effects and some cheezy momentsAfter watching first episode, I thought myself if there is a real world of witchery, vampirism & demonic in 21st century, it should be something like A Discovery of Witches. So realistic, logical and believable.This tv series which drags me into its story in first few minutes, with its great directing, acting, filmography and every other aspects has the potential to be the best new tv show after all.Can\\'t wait for next episodes.EDIT on episode 4\\nIt may feel slow for some people, but it\\'s the style of this series by slowly getting under your skin and I guess the pace is getting faster and faster by each episode goes on. Anyhow, don\\'t expect an action fantasy tv show. It\\'s a drama approach to fantasy world. Still amazing and still 10 out 10 for me.By the way, I don\\'t think of anyone better as Teresa Palmer for rule of Diana Bishop. she is brilliant. After watching the first released trailer, I knew that this would be a must see, and it didn\\'t disappoint. A world of witches, vampires and demons, the world of paranormal creatures has drawn me in. It is full of mystery and suspense. \\nI can\\'t wait for the next episode.\\nA definite watch. I don\\'t normally write reviews but these reviews are very questionable and I wasted quality time on this show smh. If you\\'re into the Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey type of movie this show is for you. Its your prototypical cheesy romance/drama with mystical beings thrown in for a little spice. I kept pushing through the episodes because the reviews are really good, but now I\\'m starting to think they have to be fake reviews. This show is insanely dull and the plot is super slow. Theres barely any action, very little magic, and lots of corny, typical romance movie dialogue. Maybe this would have made a better romantic movie than an entire series, but this show is overrated, unoriginal, poorly paced, and the plot is everywhere. I\\'m guessing it was just meant to be fan service for people who already love the book. If you haven\\'t read the book, I wouldn\\'t suggest this. Its nowhere near as good as these bogus reviews A Discovery of Witches is one of my favorite books so I was so nervous watching this first episode but no need they did it justice very true to the books - I watched the first episode and i love it being from the uk my self and watching other supernatural shows including \\n(Salem netflix )which was a personal favourite.\\nVampire diaries \\nCharmed\\nThe secret circle \\nAnd more.This shows shows supernatural in a way not done before in a calm setting with out to overly dramatically showcasing it effectively, it shows witchcraft in a good light modern if so, with an amazing cast its something special and i can not wait for more. I can\\'t imagine any actress better then Teresa Palmer for such a role. The show isnt blasting with super special effects every 2 minutes, but it\\'s more then perfect for now. Good Pilot, amazing actors, etc. Can\\'t wait to see how this will develop. And damn ..Teresa is so damn beautiful. A fantastic romantic fantasy drama. A must see. Just simply beautifully played.one hour a week is not enough! The first episode was quite intriguing and me and my gf was enjoying it.\\n3rd episode in and it\\'s just laughably bad, predictable, and generic.\\nYou will love this show if you\\'re a teenager girl between 12-18, otherwise, seriously don\\'t bother. Okay, so i never read the novel and if someone tried describing this show to me i probably wouldn\\'t have been interested. I love supernatural shows but the concept seemed kind of hokey. The first episode had me hooked. I love the chemistry between the two leads. You can definitely get a sense of why they\\'re drawn to each other but it\\'s the actress that stands out to me the most. She has the right balance of intrigue, independence, and naivete and none of it comes off forced. This show is also beautifully shot. I love the cinematography and how the settings are used that jump from Oxford, New England( i\\'m guessing), and Italy. Much of the lore is there , with a few changes, and they have a unique spin on it. \\nI hated True Blood because of how over the top and trashy it was but this felt masterful and its strength is in its subtlety.... This is definitely one of my new favorites I was so prepared to LOVE this series, especially since it stars one of my favorite actors (Matthew Goode), but sadly this was not the case. The writing was painfully cliche, with some of the laziest characterizations I\\'ve seen in awhile. The lead actress is a total bore. Even the music is bad. It just got worse and worse with each episode; characters who have never met onscreen suddenly know each other well. Characters who have barely gotten to know each other are suddenly making declarations of undying love to one another. Transitions are jarring and plot developments are endlessly frustrating. The script is tedious; I feel bad for the actors who have to speak such uninspired lines. Sometimes I swear I can see Matthew Goode questioning his life choices as he delivers his cringiest lines. Why couldn\\'t the writers take what was obviously lame source material and try to make this story 2018-level TV-ready? Lazy, lazy shame. What a stinker! For those who claim they read the series and thought they did a good job with this I can not believe they are real reviews.\\nDeborah Harkness took this genre to an entirely new level, I thinking persons level. Her stories are well researched, well written and completely engaging, everything an author should be, but rarely is in this genre.\\nI have read the books so often I can recite parts of them from memory. The characters were strong, smart and likeable, even when being disagreeable.\\nThis TV series contains nothing that made the books wonderful, they pretty much threw the storyline out and made another one.\\nNone of the actors remotely resemble the characters in thought or action. Even with the time allowed for character development that a TV series gives you over a movie, they have not taken the opportunity to do it properly.\\nTerrible effort and shame for destroying a wonderful story. What to say? I have been waiting for this show with mixed emotions from the first whisper of it being done... I have wanted to see it come alive from the first book I read years ago and honestly never thought I would see it happen because of the sheer amount of plots, sub plots and the long list of primary and secondary characters that are constantly changing from book to book. I absolutely love the trilogy it is in my top 5 all time favorite book trilogies/series ...That said, yes it is true they moved some things around and changed parts and details around but that is to be expected when trying to have something completely visual relay the same basic understanding that reading the book does. With a book time can be taken to explain things in depth to a point that a show or movie can not accomplish unless it has a full time narrator talking constantly as the show is going. So yes, it is true that it does not follow the book to the letter however it does a good job of relying the same message one gets by reading the book. It does also jump forward at a quick pace it seems until I went back and realized just how much of the back story and details that it takes so long to cover in the book would not have worked trying to fit into the first 2 episodes of a show. It would have been mostly flashbacks if that route were taken. That being said, they will probably pull bits and pieces of memories out over the season as opposed to getting it all out at the beginning like the book. Different types of entertainment (book and TV/show) so different way of presentation. I think it\\'s off to a great start and I look forward to seeing the series unfold. Wow! Love it so far!! The series starters as a an action packed fantasy series, but slowly the series is turnIng into a soap series. Just watched episode 7, it\\'s mostly talk-talk-talk and scarcely any action.. bummer! First two parts looked promising. Dark, mysterious. Unfortunately, the series went down very quickly from there. Diana is absolutely annoying and unbelievably oblivious to supernatural things happening around her, despite being a professor in alchemy and raised by witches. Can you be any more ignorant? The show quickly turned into a \"teen\" vampire drama of girl in danger with her boyfriend-vampire coming for the rescue every time. All other storylines and characters feIt uninteresting, too, and sort of out of place, despite being part of the whole \"conspiracy\" and overall picture. I was kinda hoping for better drama and more adult feel for this one (haven\\'t read the books, but I anticipated from the cast involved, and the mainly UK setting that maybe ... eh). Definitely in the same package with likes of Vampire Diaries or Twilight Saga. Most of the dialogues were so cringeworthy, that I felt ashamed for some of the great actors being involved with this project. What a giant martyred pain in the ass Teresa Palmers character is & I don\\'t think I can stomach anymore of her long tortured little girl glaring into the distance. She\\'s pretty dumb about everything, for apparently being an academic specialising in this field.\\nWasted opportunity w this series, could have been excellent. But let\\'s be real. This is Twilight fan fiction and the problem with this is that Twilight was written and filmed long enough ago that we should be able to navigate around the same tropes and pitfalls, especially since these characters are fully grown adults and the characters of Twilight are horny teenagers. Was the cinematography all done in the VSCO app? Does the protagonist\\'s spell-binding curse limit her to an exclusively blue wardrobe (but like only the exact same shade as her eyes because heaven forbid we rock indigo out here)? I think there was so much potential as far as the lore and magical fantasy go. The cast is pretty great, too. But somewhere along the line the writers sort of said, \"Eff it. Let\\'s pretend Anastasia Steele went to Oxford and had magical powers, run it through an Instagram filter and make the sex even less interesting.\" Do you know that old movie rule that you subconsciously decide whether you\\'re going to enjoy a film or not within the first ten minutes? Well, it wasn\\'t true this time, because after the opening sequence, I was pretty sure I was going to hate \"I Am Number Four\". Thankfully, I was in for a pleasant surprise.It all starts with bad CGI-monsters and some guys in Star Trek make-up chasing people around in the jungle. We then cut to some jocks doing tricks on jet skis and some bland blonde girls admiring them - and I thought this is going to be terrible. Then the story picks up and the movie gets better from there.The story involves a couple of characters and mysteries, but is never too complicated. After the initial jet ski scene, the main character actually turns out to be played quite charmingly by Alex Pettyfer. He\\'s supported by his mentor/protector (solid as always: Timothy Olyphant). Glee\\'s Dianna Agron plays Number Four\\'s love interest. She comes across very natural, so that the love story that unfolds is actually engaging instead of vomit-inducing like that of that other movie with the whining Vampires and the shirtless Werewolves.Of course, \"I Am Number Four\" is by no means a great movie. The CGI sucks in places and the make-up of the bad guys is just awful. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of a popcorn movie.However, I think we can all agree that it would be silly to actually expect a masterpiece, considering the movie\\'s premise. For what it is, \"I Am Number Four\" is an entertaining little fantasy flick for teenagers and undemanding twenty-somethings. Add to that the fact that this movie is neither a sequel nor a remake, that it\\'s not based on a comic book, a TV series, a computer game or toys, and it\\'s enough to lift \"I Am Number Four\" heads and shoulders above its genre competitors. OK the effects were great, the action was impressive....I mean visually, the movie was pretty good.And I\\'ll even say the acting was done well. The characters were charming, the pace was slow at times, but not dead boring slow.My only problem was, how many times are we going to see the exact same story. I mean this was your typical teen drama....new kid..shady past... weird and wants to stay to himself, but there\\'s always some cute chick who he risks everything for.There\\'s always bullies who hate that he\\'s got the attention of the cute chick, so they always end up having a conflict. I mean 90% of this movie was your typical high school drama teen movie. And the \"discovering\" of his powers was like the alien version of spiderman.I mean it\\'s the same ole same ole....you explore and try to harness your new powers beating up bullies and jumping around where no one can see you until a super strong villain pops up you have to fight in the climax.I mean as far as an overall success the positive things I mentioned originally (great effects, charming characters, impressive action) can for the most part salvage the movie. But if you\\'re a fan of the genre, don\\'t expect anything new. 3 1/2 outta 5 stars... This is not a bad film. It\\'s just not that great. The story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment. I also found myself un interested in the characters, apart from the dog, but who doesn\\'t love a cute dog? It just seemed to be cliché after cliché after cliché. I have to remind myself I didn\\'t go to watch shawshank redemption 2 or a William Shakespeare film adaptation. Instead I watched 90 odd minutes of blah. Good special effects and action sequences plus the added bonus of eye candy were just enough to save it. Just.If you go to see \"I am number four\" I suggest you leave your brain at home then sit back and enjoy the pretty lights and moving pictures. Don\\'t expect much and you might actually enjoy it. In a perfect world, the convoluted mess called I Am Number Four could have been great. It had all the trappings for success: based off a semi-popular novel for teens, a fairly accomplished director in D.J. Caruso, the producing \"talent\" of Michael Bay, two hot young stars in Alex Pettyfer and Glee\\'s own Dianna Agron, and an enigmatic, yet intriguing trailer campaign. So why is it that the final product is one of the most deeply unsatisfying theatrical experiences I have had in some time? Opening with the death of \"Number Three\", we jump into the life of John (Pettyfer), an alien being protected on Earth from a group called the Mogadorians. As it turns out, the Mogadorians wiped out the population of John\\'s planet years before, except for nine children with extraordinary powers. For some reason, they have to be killed in order, and with three down, John is next in line for extermination. As he goes on the run with his protector Henri (Timothy Olyphant), they settle into the small town of Paradise, Ohio. Soon after, John starts gaining and learning more about his powers. But with a new love (Agron) and his lust to just be normal thrown into the mix, John may be in more trouble than he can imagine.I have never read the source material for I Am Number Four, but I would hazard a guess that it did a half decent job of explaining what is going on, and did not just strive to set future sequels in motion. The film on the other hand, suffers because the sequel seems to be the only thing in mind outside of special effects. We are thrown right into John\\'s life, and we only get little nuggets of reason for what is going on at any given time. We never get full explanations, and are never even offered the ability to piece it together by ourselves. The film seems merely content giving us hints, offering little enigmatic moments to get us thinking. But instead of doing anything with these scenes, it merely continues trucking along to its eventual ending which promises a continuation and the hope for some further reasoning for what is happening. But if the filmmakers do not care about informing the audience now, why will we care later? But this would not be such a slap in the face if we had not already seen so many films in the past half-decade doing the exact same thing, attempting to replicate the success of the Harry Potter, Twilight and The Lord of the Rings franchises. The Golden Compass, Cirque du Freak: The Vampire\\'s Assistant, The Spiderwick Chronicles, and Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief (which this film oddly resembles) are all examples of studios making films out of young adult books, specifically to capitalize on the potential for sequels and lengthy franchise possibilities. They all failed in varying degrees, because they all suffer from the same thing I Am Number Four suffers from – not enough plot, too much dependence on a sequel. Had all of these films even attempted to be able to stand on their own, perhaps they would have gotten the sequel they seemed to think they deserved. I know Four is part of a proposed book franchise, as opposed to an already established book franchise, but it merely skipped the waiting in the middle for the eventual film.Should these plot and sequel problems not already be enough, Four suffers from copying Twilight a little too close (even including the notable musical cues from current alt-rockers). Sure, there are no vampires, but the romance between John and Agron\\'s Sarah feels a little too forced for comfort. Right in the middle of being hunted down to be systematically wiped out, we are supposed to believe that someone who has spent their life running, would simply fall in love out of the blue, and not feel any consequences? We are supposed to believe he does not know better? Sure he\\'s a teenager and we all did stupid things when we were that young, but why does the focus of the film seem to hinge on the chemistry and romance between these two star-crossed lovers? I was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion, and the need for John and Henri to keep running to avoid death. But then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story, and totally loses anything it has going for it. A last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of sci-fi is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst. It is awkward, silly, and practically plagiarizes Twilight.I will say I was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story, but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop. The film criminally underuses Olyphant, the only actor who actually acts in the entire film, and makes him into an almost useless background character. We only get glimpses of Teresa Palmer\\'s character throughout the film (the trailer already gives away any mystery of who she might be), and when she finally shows up to do something, she merely speaks in overtly sexual allusions. Pettyfer and Agron both seem to suffer from not knowing what emphasis to put on their character and when, and relative newcomer Callan McAuliffe is stuck in the cliché-ridden role as the know-it-all geek of a best friend.When it attempts to work, I Am Number Four is quite interesting. I would have loved more story, and a whole lot less romance. Even what does work (including the decent special effects) seems to suffer as a result of all the melodramatic romance.4/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com). This movie isn\\'t the best action film of the year. This movie isn\\'t another tongue-in-cheek teen movie. Most importantly, this movie isn\\'t a \"wannabe\" of the Twilight franchise. This movie is entertainment for all viewers that delivers a good story, action, and desire to want more at the end. I was lucky enough to work as an extra in this movie for about 2 weeks and was able to see how this film came together, piece by piece. The visual effects truly make the film enjoyable. Seeing it behind-the-scenes, I couldn\\'t imagine what it would look like. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.The acting was believable and consistent (unlike previous reviews who claim the actors lost steam halfway thru the film). Timothy Olyphant is perhaps the best character in the film, Pettyfer following right after. The best part about this film: the love story within the plot WAS NOT painful/annoying to watch (such as Twilight).This movie is definitely worth seeing in theaters, as the action scenes truly make the experience. I Am Number Four is a great start to what could be a fantastic franchise. Based on the NY Times best-selling novel by \"Pittacus Lore\" (an alias for the memoir-fabricating James Frey and Jobie Hughes), I Am Four kicks off the cinematic proceedings with an intense and creepy jungle chase scene and an intriguing - albeit fairly unoriginal - concept.The planet Lorien (COUGH krypton COUGH) was destroyed, and nine of its alien children were sent to earth. Why earth? Who knows. Perhaps earth\\'s atmosphere is the most similar to Lorien\\'s? A race of 7-foot tall humanoids called the Mogadorians are hunting down the children one at a time. Why? Beats me. Because we wouldn\\'t have a story otherwise, I suppose. All we\\'re really told is \"they\\'re a race who chooses to decimate rather than colonize.\" So be it.Anyway, due to some sort of spell the Mogadorians are forced to kill the nine remaining Lorien kids in the proper order. Who established the order and how? No idea. Wouldn\\'t you be pretty ticked off if you were Number One and became aware that you were chosen to be killed first? Perhaps the numbering system is completely random. Otherwise, that\\'s a pretty jacked up system. \"Hmm, little Billy seems to be a little slow upstairs, and that lisp sure ain\\'t doin\\' him any favors. Let\\'s make him Number One.\" Regardless, numbers one to three are now dead, so the story focuses on Number Four.Number Four\\'s desperate attempts to fit in lead to yet another blown cover, and he and his guardian Henri must once again relocate - this time to the small town of Paradise, OH. Following the film\\'s somewhat promising start, the story takes an ill-advised detour and bogs down in a teenage romance marsh. It\\'s at this point that Number Four (AKA John Smith) falls in love, defends a nerd against bullies, and begins to discover his unique abilities (known as legacies).This blatant drawing from the well of the Twilight series\\' formula might giddy up the hearts of teenage girls, but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film\\'s trailer promised.That arrival comes in the film\\'s third act in the form of a deus ex machina known as Number Six (Teresa Palmer) who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rumpage against the backdrop of CGI and special-effects. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences, but the drive there should\\'ve been smoother and more evenly-paced.Dialogue is weak, character development is practically non-existent, and the underdeveloped backstory creates too many questions that lead to frustration rather than intrigue. Granted, this is an origin story that\\'s specifically designed to kick-start a franchise, but a little more self-containment would have been appreciated.One of the film\\'s biggest transgressions is the misuse of Timothy Olyphant as Henri. We\\'re told that he\\'s a Lorien warrior, and as such you\\'d expect him to join in the butt-kickery. Unfortunately, he\\'s only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped (done off-screen to mask its implausibility) by a couple of out-of-shape alien conspiracy theorists. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warrior/guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom.The film presents a seed or two of hope that the franchise can improve with each installment, but will its identity crisis allow it to do so? Attempting to be all things to all teenagers could backfire if it fails to create loyalty amongst any one demographic.Teenage audiences and those who don\\'t consume themselves with the story\\'s many flaws will be more forgiving than I. Perhaps your expectations will be exceeded, but there\\'s a good chance you\\'ll be either underwhelmed or disappointed. Wouldn\\'t you rather risk a dollar at Redbox than $10 a pop at the theater? Don\\'t say I didn\\'t properly inform you. A great movie will leave you yearning for a sequel, and I Am Number Four certainly does. First off, the visuals were astounding. This really goes without saying, but the final battle in the movie was incredible. Another sign of a great movie, my friends and I truly liked the characters. We actually cared about what happened to them (something that I can\\'t say about other book-to-movie Harry-Potter-wannabes.) Even number Six, a bad-ass female with Nightcrawler-like power was lovable!Finally, the storyline was engaging and easy to understand. Yes, there were some unexplained portions, but this is only the first movie in a series. I understood it just fine without having read the book, and there was no point in the movie where I felt that things were moving too slowly (nor to quickly, for that matter.)I would urge you not to take any of the negative reviews written by middle-aged men to heart - spend the 10 bucks and give this movie a chance. I promise you that you\\'ll end up enjoying it! If you liked the movie \"The Covenant\", which is about a teen coming into his super powers while falling in love with a brainy yet implausibly beautiful girl who spends most of the film standing agog at what he can do, then you probably will not like \"I Am Number Four\" for the simple reason that you are no longer a 13-year-old girl and this movie is almost a direct remake.The film starts out demonstrating how cool the main character is by showing him doing various tricks on a jet-ski while maintaining perfect hair. I half expected one of his friends to shout \"Radical!\", but then I remembered that this was not made in the mid 1980s. From there it pretty much degenerates into a checklist of crappy movie clichés: Brooding teen trying to fit in even though his power causes him to be different? Check. Generic bullies not realizing who they\\'re messing with and getting their comeuppance? Check. Bad guys using girl to get to main character? Yup. Love for the girl giving the hero new strength to continue even though all looks hopeless? Double check.If you\\'re looking for a movie you can turn off your brain and enjoy then I recommend renting one of the Xmen movies. If you are a girl who has just entered her teens and is tired of movies about whiny vampires, then you might enjoy this. But don\\'t expect to remember it a week later. I was thinking this would be filler for a dull afternoon. Indeed it was but I was also surprised to find I really enjoyed it. We also had the pleasure of watching it on iMax so that makes just about anything a little better. If you want to enjoy the evening then go see this one. You\\'ll see some good acting and decent new actors. Give it a chance and I think this might be the next good \"series\" of movies you\\'ll like. I say series because they left this one wide open to find numbers 5, and 7-9. I can easily see a whole trilogy or more just waiting for this one to make enough money to get it going. Although without some decent advertising they aren\\'t going to get that... :( We loved I AM NUMBER FOUR. The storyline was good. Good love interest teen romance. Number Six is totally smoking sexy hot. Good strong female characters. The cast, acting, & special effects reminded me of Disney\\'s Race to Witch Mountain which we also enjoyed. Only Complaints Spoiler Alert: There is a missing scene at the end when a character you thought was dead suddenly appeared alive without any explanation. They leave it open for a sequel which we would love to see. What\\'s up with the jock? is he alive, dead, converted to an evil zombie for the sequel? The director didn\\'t show why the jock had a life transformation and is now nice. That is our only complaint. Read some of the reviews on here so was unsure what to make of this. But loved the movie and was surprised how well it rolled. The special effects were superb as were the action scenes. Not sure why some slammed this movie but I have no problem giving this a 9. If your looking for a good weekend movie slouching on the couch eating pizza then this is the business!If your a sci fan such as myself then this is a watchable movie very watchable. I was worried that the relationship between the main character and the photographer would run away with itself and overtake the plot as is seen is so many decent movies ruined by pointless teen relationships. But I Am Number 4 did not let this happen and it glued with the plot really well. The fight scenes were well scripted and did not go on for too long. Get the popcorn out sit back and enjoy this scifi flick I don\\'t think you will be disappointed. My god! Words cannot reiterate how terrible this movie is. I didn\\'t go with high expectations. I didn\\'t expect Oscar winning performances or a witty and sharp script etc. I thought if I could give it a five or a six out of ten at most I would be satisfied with some great action, good special effects and reasonable acting, but it didn\\'t even have that. Seriously the reviewers who have given this higher than a four have seriously deluded themselves. I\\'m not a teenager, which this film is aiming for (but even then it\\'s so badly made even they shouldn\\'t like this).Before I critique this film. A brief synopsis from what I can gather. Teenager John Smith (Alex Pettyfer from Storm Breakers) who is an alien from another planet Lorien is a fugitive on the run from his enemies the Mogadarians who have been sent to destroy him after killing three other kids before him with the same abilities. Changing his identity, moving from town to town with his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant), John is always the new kid with no ties to his past. In the small Ohio town he now calls home, John encounters unexpected, life-changing events-his first love Sarah (Dianna Agron), powerful new abilities and a connection to the others like number six (Teresa Palmer) who shares his destiny. The first problem of this film is the screenplay which is a horrific mess. The synopsis I had to cobble together from a family friend who is a fan of the books (but wasn\\'t of the film). It is very loosely explained during the movie at different points with huge plot holes. If these Mogadarians want to destroy earth, why don\\'t they straight away? Why kill these teenagers who are a part of the legacy? How were the legacies and Mogadarians created? Why do the Mogadarians want to destroy earth? I think I heard something about \"resources,\" but what? Maybe this is explained in the book or subsequent ones, I don\\'t know, but for someone who hasn\\'t read them, things should have been explained and more clearly, it\\'s no excuse. Also when John saves Sarah from her ex-boyfriend and his friends pestering her at the fair, she sees him using his powers (his hands light up) to deal with the guys, but she dosen\\'t say anything??? What the heck? Then later she suddenly \"finds\" out? This sort of thing just reeks serious laziness on the hand of the writers, either that or during that scene Sarah went temporarily blind. I could go on with several other plot holes, but you get the point. The structure of the film is terribly put together with certain scenes just feeling so random, without them being linked together. Maybe the fact the film just suddenly decides to introduce new information in a convenient \"way\" like those weird creatures who guard the legacies (including a dog that turns into the creature) and the others for the Mogodarian\\'s or whatever. And while we\\'re on the subject of the Mogodarian\\'s as villains they are ridiculously laughable and not scary in the slightest. All the characters are bland with little back story like we find out literally nothing about John\\'s past or his parents. With that you just don\\'t care about them as they are little more than cardboard cut-outs. Particularly when Henri dies, in one scene with \"sad\" music. We\\'re meant to care but the characters are so shallow and boring we just don\\'t care and the whole pathetic scene just comes across as sickeningly insincere. Of course the characters being boring also comes down to terrible performances. Alex Pettyfer is just unbearably plain and looks and acts bored. He hasn\\'t got the slightest trace of acting ability (just like in Stormbreakers). None of the cast fare any better. They are all unconvincing and give some of the worst performances I\\'ve seen in films, even Teresa Palmer who I adored in The Sorcerer\\'s Apprentice could not save this. She looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue. I couldn\\'t judge her acting as such though her voice when I heard it sounded like she was trying to be sexy with a sore throat. The trollop scriptwriter who put in the embarrassingly awful and very cheesy NOT funny script that she should speak like that needs a slap.I am Number Four tries to come across as a romantic sci-fi action, but it has little action (for teen boys), only about ten minutes and even when there was, the camera jerked up and down with a shocking lack of continuity I felt dizzy and couldn\\'t make out what was going on so as a result there is no excitement you feel in \"watching\" the action. (Michael Bay who was the producer of this and still hasn\\'t learnt from Transformers 2) and little romance (for teen girls). With little romance or action, the film just pointlessly meanders itself sluggishly from scene to scene. In terms of the \"romance\" there is no chemistry between John and Sarah and even the special effects are very poor and look too obvious. The film is way too predictable with stereotypes across the board which you will notice straight away making it unimaginative and repetitive like the rest of the film. I paid £6.20 to see this abomination, I wish I hadn\\'t. This is the first turkey of the year I\\'ve awarded for a film (suppose it was only a matter of time). This is just complete rubbish and I would not advise anyone to see this travesty. There will be sequels unfortunately but I certainly won\\'t be signing up to see it. I would rather throw up thanks then put myself through seeing another one of these. Trust me I am Number Four is that crap. I would seriously advise you to skip it. It is one of the worst films I have ever encountered. I was lucky and saw an advanced screening on this film and I was half disappointed and half impressed. First of all, I read the book and I just thought that they left out a lot of detail from the book, some big ones too. But, the visuals and action is what kept me on my seat. The story, I thought they did a decent job with, but if they sticked with parts of the story in the book, it would have been a better film. They could have made the movie longer and added some other details from the book. I mean, in the book, Henri and John can open the chest he hides together. They open it in the book, and Henri lays John down on the table and pulls out a rock like crystal from the chest and it appears as their planet, Lorien, and with that, Henri shows what happened on their planet the day it was invaded by the Mogadoriens, visually. They could have put that part in the movie, I thought it was a somewhat big part. But overall, a decent flick if you have nothing else to do or see. Check it out, I Am Number Four! I saw an advance screening of the flick tonight. The only reason I went and saw it was because my buddy had a free screening pass for 2, and it\\'s a free screening. I remember reading the book and not being very impressed, however I can\\'t say I can pinpoint exactly what\\'s been left out since I had forgotten most of it. Not sure if I even care now that I\\'ve seen both ends of the spectrum.Caruso tries a lot to hide the book\\'s flaws, and he really does try hard. But somehow he only makes them more obvious. I\\'ll admit there was tonnes of action and good special effects, but really, when the story wasn\\'t stealing from other sci-fi (Animorphs, Johnny Mnemonic, Superman- there\\'s even an insulting John Carpenter\\'s The Thing nod too), it was overloading the audience\\'s brain with Clichés that can be found in almost any teen movie... ever. And some gigantic plot holes you could drive a tanker through.The action scenes I nearly left the cinema they were so bad. It\\'s like Caruso told the camera crew to zoom in really close while holding the camera and shake it all about, shine flashlights in the camera lens, and move it violently when some gets punched. Shaky Camera and quick cutting must die, I\\'m tired of it.The soundtrack was so bombastic and over the top. At times it sounds like the boom mic is being banged against the inside of a 50 gallon drum. At others it\\'s like they\\'re attacking their strings as fast as they can really fast. The film\\'s opening score piece over the panning shot is especially insulting- it doesn\\'t help that it lasts a minute long and the cue\\'s buildup is hilarious.I know the movie is based on a book, but with even that said, there is a tonne of clichés. Hot chick who loves photography? Check. New kid is instantly buds with the nerd? Check. Douchebag jock who loves the hot chick? Check. Kid finds out he has powers he can\\'t control? Check. evil villain are following kid and guardian? Check. Kid\\'s guardian dies and he must do the mission without him? Check.There\\'s also an annoying homo-erotic undercurrent between Sam and \"John\". Also, don\\'t get me started on the Thirty-Sue pileup that is Number 6.For every cliché, there\\'s a gigantic plot hole. Why isn\\'t the grocery clerk suspicious of an alien with a hoodie and sunglasses buying a crap load of turkeys? How is \"John\" unable to control his powers in class yet able to control them perfectly in his backyard a matter of hours later? Why do the Mogadorian(!!!!) speak with Jamaican accents? How is the dog able to become all super-dog all of a sudden? Why are Lorien so perfectly humanoid with a true lack of alien qualities? And how do Lorien copulate? Yeah, let\\'s not go there, because the last thing this film needs is a Lorien sex scene. Of course, \"I Am Number Four\" is by no means a great movie. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of 90 minutes. The story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment like if the nine aliens are so powerful, why can\\'t they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I\\'ve never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence. But however, This is not a bad film. It\\'s just not that great. Among the good points, the visuals were astounding. The final battle in the movie is something that save the movie from being a huge disappointed. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences. And also the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic, bald, covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth, carry some pretty cool weapons, and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.The main problem is the movie is totally clichéd. I mean how many times are we going to see the exact same story. I mean this was your typical teen drama\\x85.new kid..shady past\\x85 weird and wants to stay to himself, but there\\'s always some cute chick who he risks everything for. There\\'s always bullies who hate that he\\'s got the attention of the cute chick, so they always end up having a conflict. I mean 90% of this movie was your typical high school drama teen movie. And the \"discovering\" of his powers was like the alien version of spiderman. I will say I was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story, but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop.This Twilight series\\' formula might cheer up the hearts of teenage girls, but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film\\'s trailer promised. I was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion, and the need for John and Henri to keep running to avoid death. But then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story, and totally loses anything it has going for it. A last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of sci-fi in the form of a machina known as Number Six (Teresa Palmer) who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rampage against the backdrop of CGI and special-effects, is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst.Acting wise, Alex Pettyfer is just plain with no expression but of course teenage girls will love him for his looks and physique. Dianna Agron is pretty and acts fine. Teresa Palmer who I adored in The Sorcerer\\'s Apprentice looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue. Kevin Durand as the Mogadorian Commander is good in his evil act. But one of the film\\'s biggest disappointed is the misuse of Timothy Olyphant as Henri. The film criminally under-uses Olyphant, the only actor who actually acts in the entire film, and makes him into an almost useless background character. We\\'re told that he\\'s a Lorien warrior, and as such you\\'d expect him to join in the butt- kickery. Unfortunately, he\\'s only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warrior/guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom. And then there\\'s the relative newcomer Callan McAuliffe stuck in the cliché- ridden role as the know-it-all geek of a best friend though he\\'s fine in whatever he has.All this said, though this movie isn\\'t the best action film of the year, its still worth a watch for the CGI and the last act of the movie. This is the first installment of the probable trilogy or more. So let\\'s just hope they do it right in the sequels. I rate it 5.5 out out 10. Watched the movie \"I am number four\" tonight. The first 40 minutes it felt like I was watching a re-hashed \"Twilight\" movie rather than a sci-fi/horror pic. But then it got good. It was well worth the watch if you can make it through that first half of beaten to death formula high school angst movies that Twilight has seemed to spawn. You can bet that there will be sequels too, but they may be straight to video. The first half of the movie I give it 1 star, but it was the fault of the story, not the acting. The second half, I give it 8 stars. The acting was good, there were very nice special effects and some pretty cool alien bad guys in the style of \"Pinhead.\" I\\'ll be honest here. I Am Number Four is a yawn. And when I\\'m not counting minutes till it\\'s over, I\\'m snickering at the amazingly cheesy lines. Seriously, I haven\\'t watched a movie with lamer lines since the Twilight series.Which was a shame, really, since I was so anticipating this movie because a) Alex Pettyfer was so cute in Stormbreaker and I\\'d like to see more of him, b) I love Diana Agron, and c) I love a good teen drama/superpower movie. But IANF was such a disappointment in the way that there\\'s nothing believable about the movie AT ALL.So the Mogadorians want to kill the 9 surviving Lorien kids with superpowers (called Legacies). Why? It\\'s not really clear. Ethnic cleansing perhaps? One of the characters explained how the \\'Mogs\\' don\\'t colonize, but decimate instead. So why go to all the trouble of searching for the 9 scattered in all corners of the world? Why not wipe out Earth and be done with it anyway since they live to destroy anyway, right? It didn\\'t help that right when Number Four\\'s number is up (pun intended), he decides he wants to be \\'normal\\' and \\'go to school\\'. And the overprotective guardian said yes. Sure, what\\'s a murderous predator compared to listening to your teenage ward\\'s whining 24/7 right? And what\\'s with Number Four\\'s propensity to constantly ignore (sound, life-saving) advice anyway? Is he trying to get killed? Or is it that it\\'s more interesting to have a character that breaks all the rules since the main character never dies, anyway right? All in all, I\\'d say the movie\\'s a flop. The characters are either annoying, unmemorable or carbon cutouts of every other movie. The appearance of Number Six makes it slightly more interesting but in the end she\\'s just a blonde version of Megan Fox. The script was painfully shallow and the story\\'s just...meh. This is quite a strange movie and I could not determine whether it was a horror, a sci-fi, or a thriller. IMDb describes it as an Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller, though I would have to add elements of horror into this film. The horror elements is that the film is set in a small American town (though it is noticeable that main street has not yet been destroyed by Walmart) name Paradise (horror films always seem to be set in places with pleasant sounding names), the scene is generally dark and dreary, and the main characters are up against an mysterious force that is substantially more powerful than they are. Actually, a lot of films with the sci-fi moniker tend to actually be horror movies, and the only reason that they are sci-fi is because they involve aliens or futuristic scenes or technology. I am now thinking that sci-fi is not actually a genre in itself, but rather a thematic setting, since most sci-fi films will fall into action, horror, thriller, romance, and I will throw in fantasy as that is probably a genre in itself (though it is probably better classified as epic).This film is about a teenager (obviously so that it will appeal to a younger audience) who turns out to be from another planet. His planet was destroyed by a race known as the Mogadorians however he and a few others managed to escape from their planet and are hiding on Earth. The catch is that the Mogadorians have found their hiding place and have traveled to Earth to locate them. They have already killed three of them, and now they are after him.What we also learn of the hero (whose name is John Smith as he is trying to hide) is that he is of a special breed from his planet and as he grows older he develops extraordinary powers. We don\\'t know if the powers are standardised or unique to each individual, though when we meet number six we suspect that it is the later. The other interesting aspect of this film is the nature of modern technology. While John Smith is attempting to hide and remain hidden, with the internet he is finding this very difficult. Further he has the urges of your average teenager to go to school and to socialise. However it is difficult to remain hidden in an American Highschool as if you are a jock, then you will be noticed, and if you shun the jock culture, then you attract attention to yourself.I guess another aspect of this film is about fitting in. In a way John wants to have a normal life, even if it involves not fitting in. We notice that he is the all American handsome hero, though he rejects that culture and befriends the school geek (and it turns out there is some connection between the school geek and his people) and the girl that has been turned into an outcast (and we also learn why she becomes an outcast). However, while at the beginning this film is about the new kid fitting in, it becomes clear that he goes from being the outcast (chased by the police as he is strange and different) to being the saviour. It should be remembered, even though it is not explicitly stated, that once the Mogadorians (whose appearance are quite monstrous in itself) have finished with their prey, they will turn onto the people of Earth, and without these protectors, they will not have a chance. Once again it shows that desire of the developed world to have a saviour that can stand up to the threats the we face on a daily basis. Unfortunately, unless one includes Jesus Christ in the fold (and Christ is not a superman in that sense of the word – he came and died so that we might be reconciled to the father, not to step up and defeat every evil force that comes our way, especially since evil in itself is quite subjective). I have complained many times about the films which pretend to capture the same childish spirit from Harry Potter. However, the flood of Harry Potter imitators seems to have diminished in recent months. The reason? The success of the Twilight saga provoked a \"change of direction\" from the Hollywood executives, and instead of exploring variations of \"magic boys save the world\", they are now desperately searching for new instances of \"forbidden romances between teenagers with supernatural powers\". For better or for worse, I Am Number Four belongs to this nascent sub-genus, and I found it to be boring and lacking of any emotion and originality.I Am Number Four covers a well-known ground from the fantastic cinema as well as from the juvenile romance one. And I am not precisely against of that; director D.J. Caruso previously made two unoriginal but dynamic and entertaining movies (Disturbia and Eagle Eye), something which gave me hopes of finding some redeemable elements in I Am Number Four. Unfortunately, very few things worked in this movie (at least in my personal experience), because I could never get interested in the characters or in their forced romance, and much less in the horribly trite sci-fi concepts with which it pretends to adorn its tiring narrative.To start with...Mogadorians? Was that the best name which came to mind to author Pittacus Lore (in fact a pseudonym of Jobie Hughes and James Frey) for the villains of the book on which this movie was based? Sure, the name by itself does not have too much importance, but it is a good example of the creativity level from the whole film. The heroes are handsome young people who look like models; the villains are bald and pale, with piranha teeth, and they suffer from the \"talkative villain syndrome\", revealing their plans or talking more than they should when they could easily exterminate the heroes.One of the few things I liked in I Am Number Four is Teresa Palmer\\'s energetic performance. In fact, I think the film would have been much more entertaining with her in the leading role, instead of the insipid couple of Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron. However, I cannot recommend this film, because I found it to be bland, repetitive and tedious. Let\\'s try to go back to 2008. We got \"Eagle Eye\", It\\'s a mixture of various sci-fi flicks. Now we have \"I Am Number Four\". Yeah it\\'s based on a book, but everything you see is familiar. I just noticed most of Caruso\\'s sci-fi movies have clichéd ideas. Is it the writer\\'s fault? Some of the dialog is also generic. The special effects looks so homemade(look at the lasers). The actors have murmur problem. \"I Am Number Four\" is underrated in a bad way.If the nine aliens are so powerful, why can\\'t they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I\\'ve never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence.The action scenes? Well D.J. Caruso is good at one of those, but here it\\'s messed up. The special effects is so inferior it felt like they used Adobe After Effect(except those giant monsters but still looks cheap). The effects ruined the action of this film. Clashing unreal things and look at those colors. The lasers.The performances? Alex Pettyfer thinks he\\'s cool but he\\'s obviously not. Teresa Palmer is hot but she only kicks ass in the third act. Timothy Olyphant was disappointing. A pro actor playing a boring guardian.Overall \"I Am Number Four\" is as lifeless as \"Twilight\"(sequels). Or more lifeless I guess. The action scenes could have been better. The characters thinks they\\'re cool and awesome. They are dull actually. The rest is cliché. Generic. Etc. Is it worth watching? No. How about skipping the first and second act. The third act is the only entertaining part of the movie. But I\\'m warning you. It\\'s an easy generic forgettable film. An entertaining, visually fun film that misses out on the most important parts of a movie: the story and it\\'s characters. I Am Number Four tells the story of the last remaining aliens from an extinct planet that are being hunted down and killed by the aliens that exterminated it. There are 9 teenage special aliens left and these are the ones that the bad aliens are after. These special aliens also have a guardian who was a warrior on their alien planet whose sole duty is to protect them. Oh, and these special aliens have abilities that range from moving object with their minds, super-human strength, invisibility, etc. Got all that. Because that alone make me have all kinds of questions that never get answered. The film follows, if you can guess, the Number Four alien, played by Alex Pettyfer, and his guardian, played by Timothy Olyphant.We are told that the first three aliens have already been killed and that Four is on the run with his guardian to Paradise, Ohio. There, he predictably gets tired of being told to hide in their house, so he starts to attend the high school, where he befriends the local nerd, falls in love with the star quarterback\\'s ex-girlfriend, and of course fights with the star quarterback and the other jocks, meanwhile he starts to gain his abilities and strengths. All the while this is happening the bad aliens are closing in on them as well as a mysterious blonde girl. This all occurs over about an hour and fifteen minutes which really is a shame, because the last 30 minutes when the bad aliens and Four fight is extremely fun and entertaining. It\\'s one of the better action scenes I\\'ve seen in a while, the big problem being it takes way too long for it to reach the screen.There are many problems with the story, but mainly they just leave way too many questions unanswered, and this is mainly because the whole film is set up for a franchise with multiple films. This is also what happens when you adapt a novel into a film, there\\'s always going to be aspects left out, but you have to choose what\\'s essential to the story and not, and the writers chose the wrong things. The cast really isn\\'t anything to talk about, they just look good on screen but are essentially television actors, but it\\'s not totally their fault they\\'re working with that caliber of a script.Some of the good things about the film come mainly from D.J. Caruso. He knows what he\\'s doing when it comes to teenage action movies. This isn\\'t as good as Disturbia (whose success is mainly due to Shia LaBeouf), but he does what he can with the script and the action scenes are where he shines and pulls you out of the coma you\\'ve fallen in to. It was also kind of cool to see an action/science fiction film based around the high school scenario even though they missed the mark where others have succeeded, like The Faculty. Lastly, the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic, bald, covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth, carry some pretty cool weapons, and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.Overall, its not worth the $8 or more you\\'ll have to spend to see it. If you want to sneak in for the last 30 minutes I would highly recommend that or just wait until Blu-Ray/DVD. If you\\'ve seen the show Smallville and Jumper it\\'s essentially those 2 put together with a sprinkle of the Twilight movies. Caruso does his best with some very cool and entertaining action scenes but the script is just too bare and full of holes for him to save it. The same goes with the cast, even if they were all very talented actors I\\'m still not sure it would be a worthwhile movie. With all that being said I would probably go see the sequels because of the last action scene and just to see if some of my questions are answered or just save some money and read the books... This movie actually has an interesting story, a not entirely, but at least partly original idea. It should be a good movie about aliens hunting down other aliens on earthly settings. Well its not a good movie AT ALL. Oh boy is this one baaad...., this made me really angry... First of all, the main character is a totally unlikable little sissy boy. The actor has no talent at all he has like three facial expression: the \"I am messed up\"-look, the \"I am angry\"-look and don\\'t forget the \"awww I am totally like a cute puppy, are you girls feeling hawt already?\"-look and that\\'s about it. Not just the actor, but the character is unlikable too. He is supposed to be a survivor, a teen from another planet, who is super-duper strong and one of the last of his kind. And does he have a sense of nobleness or class? No. Does he have a sense of danger or urgency? No. When it is established that the same race, which destroyed his home, is out to kill him, does he listen to his mentor\\'s advice and stays home? OF COURSE NOT. He keeps whining, that he needs to blend in and stuff. When an entire group of outer-space assassins are out to kill you, and they already killed almost every single one of your race, don\\'t you have more pressing matters, than go to school and try to be the \"kool\" jet-sky flipping kid?.... For example, like... I don\\'t know...Planning to escape the situation? Train yourself for battle? Plan a revenge? Oh come on, that\\'s not so interesting for teenage girls......They want to see the UFO go to high school and jet-sky, because he is so hawt......So he shall do that...Its pretty bad when the only thing you can think of to do with your main character is blatant fangirl-service. Go ahead little fangirls get offended and rate me down for this, but this is PATHETIC. Oh and if you want to make another crappy \"nerds and jocks and love in high school with odd girl and hawt boy\" its okay, fine by me, BUT don\\'t LIE to me with a trailer like this movie had. The trailer promised an action packed sci-fi movie and 40 minutes into the film I had to listen to god awful dialoge about odd-girls photographing habits and even more awful scenes with odd-girls parents having little family dinners with UFO pretty boy...What the....??? I am sick and tired of these holly-jolly pink teenage love stories, please don\\'t try to force them down on my throat when I am promised to see a movie about aliens fighting for their lives. I could go on about how unimaginative all the aliens (good and bad alike) were, or how this movie had the most awkward dialogue I heard in years, or how stupid it is that after UFO boys little light-show on the beach or in the class-room nobody really cared. In reality after a show like that on a beach at night during a party, well it would draw much more attention and it would be in the news for days... But why talk about these things, this movie flat out lied about its intentions and it is sad and pathetic. Seriously...I can\\'t believe anybody (except maybe a dumb 10 yr old boy) to think this was a good movie. Everyone else is probably embarrassed by this movie even existing. If this is what the author wrote and published then the published world deserves to fail. this movie is that bad.Forget the flat unrealistic unclever dialog (honestly how many time does the word freak appear the screen play - must be at least a 100.) Forget the stupidity of the plot, forget the bad special effects, forget the ridiculous premise that has been repeated ad nausea. Forget even that every five minutes is just a musical montage of emotion too intense for words and only music to express their complexity. Who ever wrote this must have been a 10 yr old boy whose total world experience must be watching reruns of 90210 and the CW channel. Oh and his parent probably live in an all white neighbor hood and home schooled the moron. What I\\'m hinting at is Adolf Hitler would have no problems with this movie. Hint? Hint? In fact, This is a movie I would have expected to be made in the early nineties - ON TV: A typical high school where even the black guy looks like a blonde white super model - no wait that is a blonde white supermodel just \\'urban\\'ly dressed - where they all love to party, go water skiing, and hang out in the woods and drink beer. What is this - American graffiti 2000? The main guy is of course is a shy troubled (always troubled!) intensely private young man guarding a secret that he is an alien with super powers. And of course he has a parental guardian warrior of sorts he is rebelling against when he goes thru his own form of puberty and urges trying to control it all. There\\'s of course a pretty girl. There\\'s a bully who is so unrealistic that the geeks would probably make fun of him.By now you should be groaning. Sorry. I\\'ll stop.In the words of Roger Ebert: \"This movie sucks.\" In toto.There is not one redeeming feature of this movie. I can only imagine that the positive reviews on here are actually the studios own hired goons writing up fake positive reviews.In short: do not see this movie. Saw an advance screening of this and thought it was terrible. The first two minutes start out great, with a pulse-pounding scene that grabs you by the throat and gets you immediately interested, but it\\'s all downhill from there. Having the revelation that the lead characters are aliens be given away so early in the film, in a terrible voice-over to boot, took most of the wind out of this movie\\'s sails for me. The villains are over-the-top in a bad way, the dialogue is horrible, and is delivered by actors who seem to be trying their best for a while, but eventually seem to stop caring and give terrible performances as a result of the lack of material to work with. It felt like an hour and a half long bad Smallville episode, which seems about right since it\\'s written by a former Smallville writer. The movie had potential, had they taken more time on the script. It dives straight into the movie and if you\\'re thinking \"Whats going on?\" Don\\'t worry, everyone else is thinking that exact same thing. And they shoot out clues like a troubled teen with a gun. And do we really need to suffer through the dramatic \"Oh, I so want to kiss her\" so I am going dramatically string along the unbearable seconds and then brush her hair out of her face. What are you telling her? I think you should spend more time brushing your hair.Anyways, besides that some cool action scenes, 1 or 2 that I can remember. Had the typical drama with all movies with a hero; a guy, a girl, \"I can\\'t handle the path I\\'m on\", \"I want both; to follow the path and the woman\", and \"I\\'m such a boob my ovaries are protruding.\"....blah, blah, blah. I personally think this movie is one of the greatest horror movies ever! Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman\\'s acting is very good, absolutely credible, almost like Rosa Byrne\\'s performance in Insidious, which was flawless. The cinematography was good, dark scenes pretty clear, intense sound effects well achieved.If you go to the cinema with your childhood fears, you will really enjoy this movie. It\\'s full of scares and if you put attention to them, they are the kind of scares that you really fear when you are a kid.I don\\'t understand why people cannot leave their critics-attitude at home and simply enjoy this movie or any other movie. If they do it, you\\'ll enjoy it a lot. Lights Out is an interesting stab at a horror movie based on a 2013 short film of the same name. The movie\\'s novel concept is a creature that can only be seen and manifest in the dark. Turn a torch on, and it disappears. Naturally, this means that a lot of the movie is spent in the dark but this works well.The use of lighting is one of the movie\\'s strong points and allows for some creative, and occasionally funny, uses of torches, candles and even car headlights. This technique generates a lot of the scares and atmosphere and given the movie\\'s title, this is a must. Definitely top marks for the director on this part.Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman do well in the lead roles as the unfortunate kids with a crazy mother, played by Maria Bello. The problem with the movie is that apart from its main concept, it doesn\\'t add much else. Clichés abound and yes, there is the mandatory dark basement (groan). Most of the scares are jump-out-at- you shocks and it\\'s all been done before. Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to use psychological horror and churns out movies that are just twists on the same theme. This is probably a bit harsh as the movie is enjoyable enough and it\\'s well-written, but I long for something new that isn\\'t so long in the tooth.The supernatural horror is effective and does elicit a genuine threat to the characters. Maria Bello, in particular, does well to ramp up the threat levels and makes you wonder who is going to make it out alive. As already mentioned, this was based on a short film and it really still is, coming in at around 80 minutes. Perhaps there wasn\\'t enough material to make a longer movie but there\\'s a feeling that it ends just as it gets going.Lights Out is a decent film if you feel the need for a dash of supernatural horror but don\\'t expect anything stand-out; it just doesn\\'t deliver enough of a impact to make it memorable. It\\'s good for what it does but don\\'t buy too much popcorn as you may not have time to finish it. This movie will get your pulse up fast, revealing the \"horror\" very early on. Interestingly enough, it keeps that pulse up throughout the movie despite of this. The concept of something that can only appear and be seen if it\\'s dark (and with a somewhat supernatural ability to destroy light bulbs) is bound to lead to a jump scare or ten whenever it appears. Towards the end you\\'ve almost gotten so used to it that the scare effect wears off a bit, and is one of two reason I don\\'t rank this a 10. But thanks to a good story and good actors, the movie still holds its ground to the very end.The characters are really good, well written and performed, and with a young boy that if not before, totally kick started his future acting career with this movie. Who doesn\\'t love a young prodigy? The plot has some weight and emotion to it, and with a solid ending that wraps things up in a much more satisfying way than most similar movies.The other small drawback with this movie for me was mostly because of slightly unrealistic behavior from our main characters, occasionally. Like when miss heels from Jurrasic World is worried that when she releases T-Rex it won\\'t be able to follow her if she runs. So, she waits for it to come close, walks for a bit, then runs. Those kinds of unrealistic behaviors. But I\\'ve seen much worse, and this movie doesn\\'t take the \"unrealistic\" very far, or often, so I suggest you just put this on and roll with it!All in all you get everything you want from a jump scare movie with Lights Out, with a good plot and good actors that deliver, and a scare factor we all can relate to. You might not be so happy with turning of your lights going to bed later that night, so if you have a weak stomach you might wanna sit this one out. Lights out\\x85 an eerie silhouette of a human-like creature loiters down the hall. You repeatedly blink in an attempt to mould its blurred lines, but the dishevelled contour of the unfathomable spectre remains absolutely motionless. Lights on\\x85 nothing there. Lights out\\x85 it\\'s moved a couple of inches near you, and your breath starts to come in short gasps. Lights on\\x85 a tinge of stinging pain strikes your bloodshot eyes, and sweat covers your petrified face. You hesitatingly move your fingers upon the switch and take an abrupt stop in the middle to wonder what will happen the next time the lights go out. Well, let\\'s see. Lights out\\x85 perhaps, you shouldn\\'t have been so curious.In 2013, Swedish filmmaker, David F. Sandberg, put out one of the most iconic horror short-film experiences that the internet had ever experienced. By that time, all the corners of the virtual realm were awash with the amateurish spine-tingling stories, and the emergence of urban legends, such as The Slenderman. They galvanised aspiring writers to leave their marks on virtual forums, but a selected few decided to take their projects to a whole new level by transferring them to a wider scope.Lotta Losten, who played the nameless main character in the short-film version, enacts a below-par reinterpretation of the same scene, which filled our hearts with sheer dread on Youtube. This time, she plays a woman who works in a mannequin warehouse, and, while clocking out, happens to have a ghastly encounter with a ghoulish presence; However, she\\'s able to sheer away from a gruesome fate. Subsequently, she warns her boss, Paul, about what she saw. He doesn\\'t seem to give much thought to it, but later on, while walking down a dimly lit hall, he comes across a monstrous apparition, which drags him into the darkness, and mauls him to death.The story follows the brothers, Martin and Rebecca, trying to fathom the depression episodes of their mother, Sophie, who happens to have an unexplained connection with the same demonic entity, who attacked Paul, their stepfather. Rebecca is the typical rogue girl who\\'s then telephoned by the school, where her brother studies, to talk about his sleeping in the class, of which he attributes to the same entity which happened to haunt his sister. Rebecca feels beholden to become his responsible guardian, inasmuch as her mother is not of sound mind to look after the boy, and that\\'s when the very same monstrosity that traumatised her childhood, decides to lurk in the shadows of her bedroom one more time.Unfortunately, the adapted version falls short in offering an immersing narrative compared to the original one. The short-film is well-off for uneasiness. It relates to the blood-curdling sensation of going to the kitchen, in the middle of the night, to get a glass of water, and feeling that, at any moment, a gelid hand will sneak up on you. The foundations of the original piece are the imaginary phantasmal beasts, which are masterfully woven due to mere creaks and noises.The experience does not establish a favourable pace in order to evoke a heartfelt sympathy towards the characters. The film doesn\\'t take too long to showcase its premise by walking us through its mechanics. A glowing lamp pops up in the screen signalling its importance in the narrative and it appears that the whole story is used as a mere background for its successful jump scares extravaganza. \\'Lights Out\\' didn\\'t seem to have inherited the same traces that its predecessor could have bequeathed, instead, it limits itself as a roller-coaster filled with jump scares that do not allow the viewer to take in the events. Notwithstanding, it does not entirely fail to regale us. The formula can be categorised as hackneyed, but gets its message effortlessly through to us by simply saying: Grab a torch and give darkness a wide berth. Lights Out\\x85 enjoy the ride.Verdict: 2/5 Lights out really is a great modern horror film. It offers great thrills and also offers wonderful acting. Every actor did their job beautifully and the characters they portray are well constructed, they are not just surface level, cardboard cut out characters. The visuals are good, the darkness and the creepy eeriness effect of a lot of scenes work very well. There are some scenes that may even be somewhat hard to watch because of the utter creepiness. Diana and the visuals that make her up are done very well and the horror is real here, it\\'s not cheap or cheesily boring. The opening of the film is also very effective in its attempt to be truly scary. This movie isn\\'t very gory or overly grotesque either, it has a minimal amount of blood/gore, and some violent images, but not a whole whole lot, which it good and a wise decision by the filmmakers, because if a scary movie is too gory or overly disturbing, then it can be distracting from the plot. You want people focused on the plot of the movie and on what\\'s going on, not on the ridiculous amount of gore. Lights out receives an 8/10 on my scale. A man called Paul (Billy Burke) is working after hours and is murdered by a supernatural entity in the shadow. When his son, the boy Martin (Gabriel Bateman), is frightened by the same creature, he sees his mother Sophie (Maria Bello) talking to an imaginary friend called Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey) in the shadow of her room. Martin does not sleep anymore during the night but in classroom and his older stepsister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) that lives alone is summoned by the social assistant. She brings Martin home and recalls he own experience with Diana years ago when she was young. Sophie and her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) investigate the connection of Sophie with Diana and come up to a scary revelation about their past.\"Lights Out\" is a flawed horror film that startles the viewer. The high-quality production has top-notch cinematography, associated to a great cast highlighting the wonderful Teresa Palmer and Maria Bello. Unfortunately the story has many flaws and it is not well explained. For example, why the light burns Diana in the end (could it be because it was directed to her?) and not along the film?; or why Sophie\\'s suicide destroys Diana (was she creating the entity? Why?). Was Sophie having problems with her first and second husband? Or is just Diana\\'s jealousy. Or how it was explained to the police how Paul, two police officers and a housewife were mysteriously murdered. The writers could have been more careful with viewers that are not brainless. At least, in \"Der Fluch von Darkness Falls\" (a.k.a. \"Darkness Fall\"), the entity is better explained. But anyway it is worthwhile watching this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Quando as Luzes se Apagam\" (\"When the Lights Are Out\") Lights Out, is quite possibly one of the most visually and mentally scary films in the last two years. The film is yet another in a string of horror movies that uses diseases as allegories for its premise, and this premise alone is genius. Lights Out is often unnerving and sometimes terrifying, dark in look and tone, without feeling recycled or derivative. The biggest strength of the film is that the story is constructed in a way that the audience is always wondering if something will happen.The most genius element of the film is the look of the creature that haunts this movie \"Diana.\" Diana is an all-black figure that lurks in the dark, and kills whoever threatens it. That being said throughout this film the audience has to fear that this character could pop out of any dark space at any given time. At 81 minutes, not a single second is calm or peaceful, because the mere sight of sight of this creature is unnerving. However, the writers and crew deserve credit for conceiving the idea of the film having a lot of darkness in it.We often say lighting is a storytelling device, but in today\\'s films it\\'s become less true the more formulaic films get. In this film lighting is very much a storytelling device, and it is used perfectly. Every scene in this film contains, just the right amount of darkness and light, almost as if there are safe areas, and areas that characters should stay away from, and they\\'re often changing. The dark look and tone of this film, create a very unnerving atmosphere, because one of the most common fears is a fear of the dark, and more notably a fear of the unknown, which exists in the dark.The film really hit a note with me personally, because I have had nightmares in the past about all dark figures living in the dark, so the film felt that much more personal to me. That being said, the film really doesn\\'t feel all that derivative of other recent horror films. A few moments, and scenes did feel familiar (Diana as a child), but those were few and far between. Even those moments that are a little familiar, are constructed in a way that they are still very scary. The film does what The Babadook did a couple of years ago, and uses depression as an allegory for the creature in the film, which is turning into a very cool concept. The film is one of the few films within the system that uses lighting to tell the story, and does so in a way that is clever and terrifying at the same time. The film is admittedly dark, and relatively humorless, and not really for children, but that kinda goes without saying. For those horror buffs looking for a good scary movie, this may be your movie. Lights Out takes some queues from Japanese-styled ghost stories, so it will be attractive to that audience. It has a strong chill-factor but a somewhat average formula, and it could have used fewer back-story explanations to make it more mysterious, especially since those elements did not feel original. Based on chill factor alone, it ranks higher than Dark Water, The Forest, Paranormal Activity, The Others, The Babadook, and The Boy, and lower than The Ring, Ju-On / The Grudge, and other Japanese-styled ghost stories, as well as any horror James Wan himself directs. Comparing it to masterpieces like The Exorcist and Poltergeist has no value. I would say its chills rank somewhat evenly with The Woman in Black and It Follows, without being as original as the latter.The ghost itself is creepy enough, but the overall movie didn\\'t have the creative twists that we enjoyed from movies like The Boy, The Others, The Sixth Sense, and 10 Cloverfield Lane. It also didn\\'t have the storytelling chemistry of James Wan\\'s own Insideous or The Conjuring movies.I am a fairly difficult person to frighten. I have been seeing horror movies at the theater since the 70\\'s, and I am usually only interested in the ones that have a supernatural or fantastical element to them. So I am very critical of them, and the only ones I collect on disc are either fun (Tremors), scary (the Grudge), or both (An American Werewolf in London). I will collect this one.Ghost stories are done to death. It is very difficult to come out with anything scary that is original. I think Lights Out could have used the guided hand of a third-party master horror writer, mostly revising the back-story revelations and using the character relationships to build suspense and mystery surrounding what is going on. Then, perhaps working up to a punch line at the end so that suddenly the back- story rushes in on the audience in one moment, with one simple revelation. It is very difficult to think of how that can be done, but other movies have done it, and the payoff is huge. I think Lights Out tried to do that a little but got confusing in the attempt. But all-in-all it\\'s a nice little scary movie with a smaller production value but a satisfying ghost. Lights Out doesn\\'t break any new ground, nor does it really attempt to. 81 minutes of PG-13 jump scares and basic horror tropes in the vein of The Grudge. Not bad for a summer fright fest, but don\\'t expect more as you won\\'t find it here. Technically it looked and sounded great, with a notable crazy-mom performance from Maria Bello. If you\\'ve seen the director\\'s original short you\\'ve basically seen this movie already, however if you\\'re looking for a quick scare without a lot of substance this should do the trick. For a good storyline with stylish direction look elsewhere, as the missed opportunities pile up rather quickly with this one. The short is a fantastic example of a clever and well executed idea. It just works, so good, and I was super excited about the feature. So it hurts to say that the feature is far from the clever short. Why? They milk the concept bone dry in a couple of minutes. You get it all in the intro and everything after the title is just a downward spiral with a bunch of desperate attempts to keep it going. I hoped this could be a great feature version of the weeping angles from Doctor Who. If you haven\\'t seen that you should watch the episode \"Blink\" right now. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000252/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2Some of my favorite horror movies are the original Chainsaw Massacre, Blair witch project and The Evil Dead. What do they have in common? They leave a lot to your own imagination. You get bits and pieces of explanation but they never give too much. They let you fill in most of the blanks. Lights out wants to explain all of it and centers the whole story about that explanation. In that way they miss the thing that made the concept so good. The fear of the dark and the fear of the unknown. When they take that from us we\\'re left with jumpscares and predictable story lines. ***SPOILERS*** Lights out is one of those movie concepts that sounds really interesting on paper, but falls flat on its face and breaks its nose as soon as it starts moving.It\\'s a jump-scare filled slug that fails to impress, featuring a boring cast with no real personality, illogical decisions to try and make you jump, and a monster that doesn\\'t even follow her own rules.The massive problem is the star of the movie itself: Diana. She\\'s an evil woman that follows the mother of two kids, and relies on the mother suffering to survive her self. The problem with Diana is that she breaks her own rules all the bloody time. One moment she needs people to open the doors for herself, the next she\\'s teleporting around like she\\'s a god. In the next moment she might disappear when you flash a light at her, or she might decide to stand there and burn while screaming her lungs out.Diana herself doesn\\'t seem to have any real goal other than being a jerk. She needs the mother to be depressed or she disappears *supposedly* but then decides to hunt her kids when they\\'re trying to avoid her, which in theory she should be grateful for.Diana is also about as subtle as a Train wreck. Whenever she appears the music blats your ears in an attempt to scare you, but when you close your ears *since it\\'s always easy to predict where she will be* and just look at the scene, you realize Diana is about as scary as Mickey Mouse with fangs.Characters also do the stupidest of things, like walking TOWARDS where they know Diana might be, instead of staying in a lit area where they\\'re safe. And the excuse \"they don\\'t know better\" is not valid, since the entire family knows Diana is real, and has multiple scars and wounds to show from it.In conclusion, Lights out is a poorly thought out movie that would have been better off staying as a short film. The only real good thing about the movie is that none of the \"living\" characters are inhumanly bastards. Don\\'t waste your time. This is what horror films should be like - focused on the scares, has really effective jump scares, even a few humor thrown in, and a not complicated story line that is very easy to follow.This is very much a very \"popcorn horror movie\" where it delivers the right scares & thrills. Maybe it was a little too short, but that\\'s okay compared to long horror movies that don\\'t really work.I found myself jumping/shouting/screaming a couple of times watching this in the movie theater and I assure you it was not because I just wanted to do it or due to the influence of peer pressure of everyone in the theater also jumping. And it has also impact beyond that, because you\\'d be thinking about this movie when you get home and you have to turn off the lights.It\\'s a very entertaining horror film and in my opinion, what horror films should be like (especially PG-13 horror films). \"PG-13 horror films\" can indeed be very effective in the right circumstances. Those people who are saying this is \"only scary\" because of the \"jump scares\" don\\'t understand effective jump scares when they see them.So bring your friends along with you and watch this in the cinema and you\\'ll be surprised. Its brilliance lies in its simplicity. Lights out doesn\\'t attempt to confuse anyone, nor does it look to introduce a totally original idea. Instead, it boldly and unambiguously taunts the audience with the message, \"you were all afraid of the dark as kids and most of you still are.\" Never has a scary movie villain had such an easy foil—light. Literally any kind of light—sun, fluorescent, bright. They each work perfectly well. Shine any sort of light in the direction of this movie\\'s monster and she disappears. Poof. She\\'s gone and everyone is safe. Writing this, I recognize that this doesn\\'t sound even the tiniest bit scary. Yet somehow, as I sat in my well-lit house after watching the movie, I felt afraid. A brief telling of the plot: there\\'s a monster-demon-ghost-girl named Diana that lives only in darkness because light hurts her, and sometimes she kills people. She haunts other people in the movie who try to not be killed by her and also they try to defeat her. That\\'s really all there is to know. Yes, it\\'s a very simple plot, but still an enjoyable one, at least in this instance.Something about the beautiful simplicity of the scare tactics just worked. Nothing confusing, nothing shocking. There weren\\'t even very many classic hanging suspense moments interrupted by loud, jolt scares. These we textbook jump scares. A seemingly safe moment with normal amounts of sound that slowly drifts to silence then POW! A jump scare. You may be thinking, \"this sounds lame. How does this brutally basic approach yields effective scares?\" Great question, my astute and thoughtful reader. I\\'ve thought about this question and come up with a few explanations. First, we owe a tremendous credit to the actress who played Diana (Alicia Vela-Baley). Her intimidating posture and sickly contorting and Freddy Kruegerish flailing arms bring to life a terrifying character, whose mere presence on screen is enough to leave viewers unsettled. There\\'s something about crouching, and Vela-Baley is great at it. Seeing a person crouch in a well-lit area is comical. But looking at a crouching figure in the shadows, that will make your skin crawl. The other explanation that I will offer is the visceral nature of the scares. Much of the movie takes place in the dark and the dark is scary. We are evolutionarily predispositioned to fear the dark. It\\'s a survival instinct. Don\\'t argue with me on this. I\\'m right. Anyway, the dimly-lit, shadowy settings are the perfect playground for visceral and pure jump scares. Director David F. Sandberg hits all the right beats in framing and lurking camera movement to maximize this simple and smart approach. So, that\\'s it. If you can\\'t stand jump scares or scary movies, don\\'t see Lights Out. Honestly, I\\'m not sure why you\\'re even reading this review if you don\\'t like scary movies. If you do like jump scares and scary movies, watch Lights Out. And maybe buy a couple extra lightbulbs or a nightlight before you do. This movie is great. It immediately engages and then keeps the audience\\'s attention. The story is compact, the acting strong and ending plausible. Perhaps the strongest performance is that of Marie Bello, who plays an emotionally disturbed woman. However, all of the performances are outstanding. The movie succeeds in creating a mood of foreboding as all are engaged in a fight for survival against an unknown malevolent force. The movie avoids the pitfall of becoming just another scary movie with contrivances that inspire laughter. Instead, it succeeds in telling a story and building the tension to its inevitable climax. That is the hallmark of excellent story telling and why this movie is worth watching. Just saw a screening of it. If you like horror I\\'d say go see it. It is a jump scare movie but there\\'s some depth and story to it. Character development was great, actually get to care about them and want to see them make it out. Acting was pretty good. F/X were good. The only part that I didn\\'t like was they did the explanation of the backstory by one character explaining it to another. I always hate when they do that, just seems lazy.The audience really got into it with a lot of people jumping and then a lot of giggles at themselves and others for jumping. Oh and in our screening the comedic relief of the big guy down front yelling \"oh s**t\" every time Diana jumps out. It reminded me of when I was a young teen and we\\'d get a whole group to go see the newest horror (F13,Halloween etc)You can\\'t take it too seriously, just sit back and enjoy it.Overall I\\'d give it a 8/10 which is pretty good for a horror flick. lights out was a film I was looking forward to. described as being one of the best and most well rounded horror films to come out in recent years I was definitely intrigued. so I went to the theatre with high expectations.so lights out is a film with a very cool concept that if done right could end up being something very scary and chilling. but, instead we get something much much less that that. this film from beginning to end was so anticlimactic, boring and generic. I will try and keep this review as spoiler free as possible..the beginning scene is extremely anticlimactic. the director does a great job of building some solid tension and some genuine sense of unease with this first sequence but the pay off was such a major let down. a character is pulled laughably into the darkness. unfortunately this is the only scene that built any tension at all. for the entire duration of the rest of the movie there is no tension what so ever. every \"scare\" is predictable and laughable. characters who know and have known for a long time that you have to stay in the light to escape this ghost foolishly hold their lights in front of them. pointing the light away from them rather than holding the light above their heads. so many scenes involved characters surrounded by darkness, holding a light in front of them and backing into the darkness. so anticlimactic and boring to watch. this ghost has the power to rip someone into the darkness and do away with them immediately.. so why does it not do this to these characters that it wants out of the picture. instead it chooses to show up and grab their shoulders, or stand in the doorway or something equally as ridiculous. for one half of the movie the ghost instantly disappears when the light hits it. but in the third act suddenly for no apparent reason at all the light burns her? there was no explaining this is just suddenly happened. the characters have the opportunity to delve into their past and really develop and maybe even have an arc. instead we get generic characters with minimal motivation and a very very vague and uninteresting back story. the exposition in the film is also ridiculous. there is a scene where Rebecca walks in and just meets this lady for the first time in her life and within seconds she says something along the lines of \"stepfather not my father. my father abandoned me.\" who says that? who says that within seconds of meeting someone? it\\'s like the director has such difficulty introducing us to these characters and their back stories that he writes them with out any thought or any heart. I will not reveal much about the story but I will just say it is the most generic story-line possible. the potential was there to write an interesting mystery but instead the ball was dropped. we get a generic, mom met a girl. the girl died because of some unjust cause and now the girl is back in ghost form. nothing interesting and you see it coming from a mile away. the acting is awful. I couldn\\'t take anybody In the movie seriously. the interactions between characters all seem so forced and unnatural.there really isn\\'t anything about the movie that was redeemable. I went into it hoping i\\'d like it. but no. the only thing I could give it as a positive would be the fact that it\\'s well made. but the budget was obviously the reason for that. if somebody gave me millions of dollars to make a movie i\\'m sure it would look and sound just as good.it had a pretty good concept but unfortunately the ball was dropped. nothing interesting or even slightly different was done and the film ended up being a stale and boring one.2/10 It wasn\\'t until I checked the credits that I realized this was based off of the short film by David F. Sandberg. I knew the lights off/lights on shadow figure thing seemed familiar. While I really loved the short film, I don\\'t necessarily agree that it needed the full length treatment. I feel like we see this a lot - capitalize off some popular internet thing that, when extended, loses some of what made it special in the first place. The short film was unsettling and creepy as it was; giving it a back story and more detail made it feel cheapened. I\\'m not a huge fan of \"BOO!\" gotcha horror movies, though; I come from a generation that was raised on the original Halloween and, for me, that is the apex of subtle, creepy, slow burn etc - everything that makes one get enveloped in a movie. When there are two many jump-atchas, it is jarring and does not make for high replay value (for me, anyway). I thought the mental asylum backstory was so played out; I feel like maybe that trope should be burned alive. We get it. Although that\\'s kind of how I also feel about kids being creepy (or \"troubled\"), too. There\\'s just so little variation in horror these days. Not all bad, though - I feel like the choice of Teresa Palmer as Maria Bello (Sophie)\\'s character\\'s daughter was a fantastic choice. I not only enjoyed her performance but I feel she looks the part; she looks like a younger version of her. I was looking forward to seeing LIGHTS OUT in the theatre. I\\'m always interested when an amateur director of a promising short is offered the chance to make a feature film out of his neat, little idea. For anyone who hasn\\'t seen the shortfilm LIGHTS OUT by David F. Sandberg on which this movie is based, go check it out, it\\'s on Youtube. It\\'s funny and creepy at the same time and develops quite a charme in just 3 minutes.However, i have to say, when it comes to the full lentgh version of the film, it is simply not more than an above average horrorflic that definitely shows a potential in a young director who hopefully hones his skills in his projects. Compared to most other horrorfilms of late, LIGHTS OUT is definitely better than works like ANNABELLE, OUIJA, THE WOMAN IN BLACK 2, SINISTER 2, INSIDIOUS 2+3 or THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, but sadly this doesn\\'t say all too much. Those Assembly-Line-Horrorfilms simply suck. It is also not quite on the same Level as 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE, THE BABADOOK or IT FOLLOWS, let alone the cinematic powerhouses of the last century.What I liked about the movie is the cinematography and the building of tension. The camera work isn\\'t very dynamic, but the scenes are always crisp and clear. The angles are well chosen. The play with light and shadow is very creative and leads to moments that are tense as well as funny, e.g. in the scene where a red neon light is shining in intervals through the window of Beccas bedroom and the creature only shows itself when said light is switched off. All the horror scenes are well directed and even the occasionally thrown in jumpscares suit the situations mostly well. It\\'s a constant back and forth between the chilling, tense absence of the creepy creature and the terror that unfolds when it finally shows itself. The horror aspect of LIGHTS OUT definitely works.However, the framework that holds everything together is simply underwhelming due to a boring script and a lack of experience when it comes to direct emotionally charged character interaction. The characters in the film are likable (especially Beccas boyfriend, who\\'s struggling hard to convince her to open up to him and is very sympathetic in his clumsiness and earnestness) and we spend quite some time to just learn about them, but the movie doesn\\'t do much with it. Especially when you consider that the movie is about a terrifying monster that comes across as scary and brutal in the well realized opening, the rest of the film is simply too harmless, undisturbing and shallow. Everything boils down to a very simple family drama without ever delving too deep into the regions of mental disorder or the disruption of family ties upon which the film touches. Also, for the most time, everything that the creature does is nothing more than a clawed hand shooting out of the dark and grabbing at one of the protagonists.Additionally, the creature seems to be quite stupid. It\\'s motivation is - as is revealed about half into the movie - to be left alone. However, when it seeks out Becca in her apartment, revealing its presence to her and even scratching its name into the floorboards, it does provoke exactly the opposite. Also, the backstory of the creature is delivered in rather lame exposition and is overall pretty messy. The script could have done a way better job at presenting an engaging mystery here.So overall, LIGHTS OUT manages to provide short, effective and tense moments of horror and develops at least characters that are likable. That makes it entertaining to watch but overall pretty forgettable. It\\'s never really bad, but also lacks moments that are really memorable (apart from the scene with the car keys, that one was awesome). Thus, I enjoyed it, but I probably do not have to see it again anytime soon. Alright, I was kinda hyped for this movie, since everybody was like \"see this if you are not easily scared\".They forgot to add \"because you will get a yawn fest\".I have to admit the movie looks pretty. It is really pretty. The cast are pretty, the sets are pretty. The light is pretty, the intro is pretty. After the intro, the movie is pretty...... ..dumb.And not \"horror-dumb\" kind of way, rather dumb in a \"this is plain dumb\" way.The decisions the characters make, the lame and way-too-much-straight-into- your-face expositions. The jump scares that made no sense. The lack of character development. It all made me yawn at about 1/3rd of the movie. And later on was only worse. The dialogues, the music/sound effects, the monster, the reveal, the lack of character depth made me wish for them to die, rather the opposite. The ways to fight the monster back were ridiculous. And the ending? The dumbest ending I have seen in a long time.Christ, this movie made me angry. So promising and yet - ultimate letdown.Rent it. Or not. Better not. Scariest movie i have ever seen. if you find conjuring funny, that\\'s fine but this movie is in completely different league. It will surely make you scream. Go for the movie, There are many jump scare in the movie specially in the second half and you will never turn off the light after watching it. Second half is too damn awesome. Movie is completely different from the trailer. The story is good. but i am telling you, this movie is scariest one. The second half is full of jump scare. you are gonna surely jump out of your seat. Finally the horror genre is at track. Wish to see more movies like this. This movie is a perfect treat for horror movies lover like me. #Lightsout is the one of the best Horror Movie in the recent time. Which is Better than #Conjuring2. The Atmos Effect is out standing,You know it before that the Ghost is going to show up even though you will get that shock. I was Like #TotatallyFreakedOut #WTF Ghost Scenes are nearly gave me a lot of #HeartAttack.Hats off to the director David F. Sandberg and Editors @Michel Aller and @Kirk M. MorriBest #Screenplay @EricHeisserer @Gabriel Bateman ( He did\\'t Just Act in the movie he lives (#Martin) in the movie )Teresa PalmerPalmer ( As usual \"rocking performance\" )@Alexander Di Persia ( This guy deserved lots of applause for a couple of important scenes in the theater ) #TooScary #StayInLights #MorthForMoney I went into this knowing that it was rated above average for a horror movie and came out feeling like I am on a totally different page. It contains all the clichés of a typical, low budget horror movie with one-dimensional characters, a loose plot, weak acting, glaring stigma towards individuals with mental illness, and more. The fact that it is unable to hit the 1hr 30min mark should have warned me there was little substance and I did not find myself invested in the characters or the unveiling of the truth behind the situation. On a sidenote, there was not much to look forward to with the scariest moments already portrayed in the trailer as well. Terribly mediocre. Going into this movie I expected much less than what the typical horror movie Genre is today in this generation. Well I will be damned!!! I had tickets to go see an early screening of this movie and let me tell you from Men to Women everyone was tense in the audience. Lots of people jumping in their seats and screams as well. This movie hit the spot from the acting which was sub-par from the evil entity. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Most people should really give it a try it is worth the money for sure. The film is only 85 minutes which was a downfall but I will take it versus a 2 hour horror movie that is boring till no end. If the media is calling Conjuring 2 horror then Lights Out must be in a different horror category because it is def. SCARY!!!! A film that brings more of the same, with virtually all the clichés of middling horror movies that take over the cinema lately, \"Lights Out\" does not stand out, the concept is different, but it is not new, the soundtrack (essence a horror film) is weak, all reasonable performances, the script is linear, tries to deepen but do not know how, and the film tries to scare all the time, but can not, and in some scenes starts laughing viewer to about shooting and narrative elements are reasonable, do not get to be bad not. If you are a cliché horror lover, go see this movie, otherwise pass away from the cinema.It\\'s another cliché that will fill theaters, but it has nothing to add. Lights Out wasn\\'t a bad film, and it\\'s always nice when a horror film comes out that has some scary moments and is only PG-13. Usually I go into PG-13 horror films with low expectations, which allowed me to enjoy the movie for what it is: a bunch of jump scares. The short film this movie was based off was simple, and effectively scary. By adding so much to the concept, it threw off the pacing. This film tried to be more than what is was. It tried to explore a deeper meaning, touching on mental illness and family problems (think The Babadook but not nearly as good), but it only managed to scratch the surface in a pretty shallow and uninteresting way. This was only accentuated by sub-par acting from quite a bit of the cast.However, the film succeeded in making Diana frightening. By not ever showing her real form for much time outside of the shadows, she managed to be pretty horrifying. Definitely a creature to inspire nightmares when you turn out the lights.Overall it was fun to go see in a theater filled with jumpy teenagers, but not really worth a second watch. A Gen Z update to Kathryn Bigelow\\'s 1991 cult classic, this remake is essentially an episode of Fast and Furious in which the vehicular exploits have been replaced with an assortment of extreme sports sequences. Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer\\'s truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer\\'s dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like \"the only law is gravity\" and \"everyone dies, it\\'s just a matter of how\", it\\'s nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can\\'t be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences, yet they\\'re not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller. If you like those 3 or 5 minute GoPro or Red Bull videos of people doing extreme sports then you will certainly like most of the movie as a lot of it is exactly that - and to be sure, those moments were pretty cool to watch and very well done. Unfortunately, in between all of those moments is a pretty boring plot line with characters that you never really care about.If you like mindless action (nothing wrong with that) then you will probably like this movie - although most of the \"action\" is extreme sports, not really guns.Apparently I have to write at least ten lines of text, but honestly there isn\\'t much more to say about the movie! Beware people, this is an early review. Being a member of a media group I caught an early screening at the Amc. I was not required to sign an NDA.Point Break is a bafflingly unsolicited remake of the 1991 cult classic of the same name. It is directed by Ericson Core, a good filmmaker who directed the 2006 Invincible, a film which is criminally underrated. When I found out that Point Break was being remade I shuddered in fear, but I when I learned that Core was directing the film, I immediately changed my tune, as I hold Invincible in such high regard, as it truly is an under appreciated film for the ages.Point Break 2015 is grotesque. I am not inherently adverse to remakes and reboots, and I am not at all a purist, I am perfectly fine with rebooting material and straying from source material if it serves the story well. What had happened here is that the studio has produced a garden variety action movie and slapped a name on it purely for the sake of brand recognition.The film exceeds expectations in the sense that this a slickly produced action film with a completely rad soundtrack. The camera work, framing and editing leave everything on the proverbial field. There isn\\'t anything new going on here, but it\\'s produced in a professional manner and the action scenes are handled with extreme care.And along comes the story, instead of our group of guys pulling bank jobs to fund adrenaline junkie lifestyles, the action men of 2015 are self aware crusaders, too cool for school, hipsters on a self imposed mission from God. Every character in this film is ball- kickingly annoying. The problem is that not one of the main characters are in possession of a redeemable quality and their motivations are completely nonsensical, they are all essentially unknowingly pseudo intellectuals.If this movie had been titles virtually anything else I may have given it a 4 or 5 out of 10, rather than a three, though the unnecessarily and intentionally sanitized PG13 vibe completely disrupts any potential the film may have had in the first place.It\\'s not good, it stinks.No sir, I don\\'t like it. I was enthusiastically exuberant about returning to what I\\'ve known as a cult classic, the original \"Point Break\". This reboot, is full of slick stunts and visuals, but the story, or lack thereof, makes this taste like pablum. I very seriously doubt that after two hours from getting out of the theater watching this, that anybody would even remember the name\\'s of the central characters in this film. Why, because the film maker neglected to give us a story where the characters are expounded and fleshed out beyond the 3 minutes for any resolute back-story on any of them. I appreciate the stunts and stunt people for their quality work involved, but stunts don\\'t make a movie. A good story, with quality characters that are inter-meshed with emotions and plots that pull the viewer into the characters\\' world is what makes a memorable film. I\\'ll stick with the original \"Point Break\". This is my first review on IMDb. I felt compelled to write this in protest to what I believe is the worst movie I have ever seen. It\\'s so bad that I will be watching out for future films by the Directors, actors and writers to avoid all their future efforts. The original is a bit cheesy but it\\'s enjoyable. This is all cheese. I\\'m amazed that it was allowed to be put out to the cinema in its form. Nobody but the stunt team can get credit here. Similar stunts can be seen in a more realistic form by a simple You Tube search. Please don\\'t watch this. The lines in this movie are so bad you would laugh if you were not so angry. I can\\'t believe it obtained a rating of 5 on IMDb. 1 at best. Imagine the intense stunts from energy drink commercial or Youtube extreme sport montage while music from Mad Max blares on background. This is where the second coming of Point Break truly excels. When it hits just the right velocity, it\\'s bloody breathtaking. Unfortunately, the narrative is not only poor, it nearly sabotages the movie like a broken parachute.Story revolves around Utah (Luke Bracey), an FBI trainee as he investigates a series of heists and their connection to a group of athletes led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez). As one might expect, it follows the same trail that Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze has placed. The new leads do what they can, although it\\'s better to watch this without comparing, because it certainly doesn\\'t have the same caliber of star or chemistry.The plot then dives head first into uncharted territory. It\\'s littered with so much \"save the planet\" preachy acts as the writing struggles to place FBI agent in the hippie nirvana angle. The motivation is just a mess of random vague one-liners, even the on-screen characters are perplexed by it. There\\'s a romance subplot, but this is mainly to show the attractive Teresa Palmer as eye candy for several short scenes.The movie is actually better when they just show the crazy sequences instead of forcing its lackluster story. It has plethora of impressive feats, from high heaven wingsuit flying, the climb on hazardous urban streets and natural cliffs, to the surfing of gigantic waves. This is the level of stunt choreography xXx and Fast and Furious wish they had.When camera pans into the right angle and lighting, as the sounds is muffled by throbbing tune of the fast music, Point Break reaches the zenith. It\\'s miles beyond what typical action flick could offer, but sadly it\\'s repeatedly interrupted by the shoddy story, which feels like an excuse to fly across the globe to do random cool tricks.If viewed only on the grand mix of cinematography and choreography, Point Break is exquisite, this would have been a great documentary of extreme sport. However, as action movie, the story is so pretentious, it simply serves as speed bump to hamper the thrill. I sincerely hope the original Point Break is much different than this lifeless, hippy-dippy, overblown Mountain Dew commercial. I\\'ve never seen the original movie, so I have no bias towards it. Based on the movie\\'s own merit\\'s, the Point Break remake is laughably awful. In Point Break, a rookie FBI agent tracks down a group of extreme athletes who go around the world carrying out crimes in unusual and life-threatening ways; they plan to do a series of near- impossible stunts called the Ozaki 8 in hopes of reaching spiritual enlightenment. At least, that was the plot for about ten minutes before the movie devolves into a series of party scenes and surprisingly dull extreme sports clips that could have been easily viewed on YouTube, all set to irritating club music. It takes a special director to make BASE jumping and cliff diving this boring. Ericson Core builds as little suspense as possible in his action set pieces and instead films admittedly well-shot highlights reels for the action scenes. Any sort of suspense conjured up is because of the great cinematography because the characters are so flat and annoying that you almost wish they would get killed off. Everyone in this movie acts stoned out of their mind. All they do is spit faux- philosophical nonsense which gets tiring after the first twenty minutes. It gets laughable towards the end of the movie with lines like \"Ideas are strong. But not as strong as a whaling ship,\" and no amount of context will make that line any less ridiculous. The unbearable dialog, muddled plot and dull characters makes this Point Break remake utterly pointless. If you\\'re not a fan of remakes, this will make you reach your breaking point. I just saw the first projection at Chiang Mai Thailand. This is one of the most horrible movies i have ever seen. Please don\\'t waste your money. The story makes no sense. The characters are stiff like frozen cucumbers, the purpose and motivations are completely ridiculous. This is a disgrace of a movie. It is as if the director wanted to create the horrible anti point break. Oh My God! Oh My Buddha! Wasted life! There is no logic, the characters are half-dimensional, the star is beyond ridiculous and annoying, the girl is on drugs, the pace is awful they jump from scene to scene like monkeys jump from tree to tree. The director clearly had no vision. I don\\'t know what to say other than STAY AWAY. STAY AWAY. The original Point Break was mostly known for its memorable bromance between Utah and Bodhi and some of its greatest action scenes ever put to film. Either way, this remake doesn\\'t bring enough justice to the cult classic. Its new approach, instead of a simple undercover cop thriller, is now a globe-trotting adventure featuring daredevils who are pulling off a grand stunt show. Though the stunts are impressive at times, it still pales in comparison with the original. The characters are bland, the plot makes no sense and every moment it tries to replicate with the original is just painfully forced for the sake of what they believe it\\'s called \"fan service.\" Therefore, there isn\\'t much reason for Point Break (2015) to exist.So Point Break is now about the stunts, but just like most action movies today, it also had to strip away personality. So whenever we see the cops, and even the daredevils, interact, it\\'s just not so entertaining. One of the charms of the original, while it had some great action sequences, even the characters are interesting to watch. Even if it\\'s trifle, it\\'s still worth spending your time. Now, it somehow becomes uninteresting filler, especially the love interest. Remember when Utah had to lie about his backstory to earn her trust? Well, now they just easily hook up and nothing else, until some twist happens or something like that. Utah and Bodhi aren\\'t as engaging, either. They\\'re mostly spewing exposition, while Bodhi is basically acting like a parody of someone from a New Age religion. Their intention of becoming Robin Hoods is kind of vague as well, but I guess no one thinks it actually matters.What\\'s really worth groaning is when it\\'s really trying to replicate the original; not by heart or personality, but by scene. They did the Ex- Presidents, even though one of them is wearing an Obama mask despite of taking place in 2015, but they only did it once, probably because there isn\\'t much room for this fan service. Also the iconic scene involving Utah shooting up the air, which apparently Hot Fuzz did it better. And the epilogue is horrendously shoehorned, like it\\'s nothing more than a tip off the hat, because... it\\'s not Point Break without it, I guess?However, there are some things to at least like in this film. The action is kind of stunning; the fact that they\\'re visually more realistic to look at than most CG-fest that blockbusters tend to feed us (except for the epilogue which is too obvious.) Maybe the best among them is the rock climbing sequence where it goes from wide shots to dirty hand shots of seeing how much they\\'d grip. Luke Bracey isn\\'t quite bad as an action hero, but he seriously needs a better material than this. Edgar Ramirez is probably just stuck with a blandly written Bodhi and really stays stick-in-the-mud with whatever he says about nature. Ray Winstone, though a good actor, is just not the memorably delightful Papas that Gary Busey established. And the movie wouldn\\'t be any different if Teresa Palmer\\'s role was written off.And Point Break (2015) is just another needless remake. There are ideas that could have been utilized more, but it\\'s too burdened by both action movie clichés and the fact that it is being Point Break. It\\'s not a good undercover cop thriller, nor a good bromantic film. And you better off watching an actual stunt show, which at least doesn\\'t make you get through to its drab expositions and the fact that it\\'s more real and not embellished by any special effects. Then again, the effects aren\\'t bad, but that\\'s not the point. You may give it credit for heightening something from the original, but it doesn\\'t do that well either. The fact how unnatural the homages are made for this remake makes it even more frustrating to watch. This movie really is unbelievably terrible. It\\'s basically a bunch of extreme sport stunt shots glued together with nonsensical storyline, bad acting and awful script.It\\'s one of those movies that\\'s so bad they can\\'t even keep basic details straight, such as they drive off a boat at night time for a swim, but it\\'s clearly daytime once they get underwater.There are some scenes that have literally no bearing on the story at all...such as the scene at the pier when the FBI UK guy is randomly pulling a boat out of the water.The time-line of just about every event makes no sense at all.The characters have nothing at all about them; they all seems to merge into one hipster bearded blob on the screen and the only way i managed to tell them apart was from their color coded outfits. I am a huge fan of the original point break made in 1991 and now I have seen the 2016 reboot and boy this is one of the worst films of the year and one of the worst reboots ever. The premise of the film sees a young up and coming FBI agent looking to infiltrate a gang of extreme athletes who may also be criminals. Luke bracey plays johnny Utah in this film and this is potentially one of the most stoic characters of the year and you will not care about him at all. His character is just so uninteresting that it really kills every scene that he is involved in. Edgar Ramirez plays bowdie in this film and just like bracey he is very stoic and isn\\'t an interesting character like his previous incarnation. He is just your generic bad guy that Doesn\\'t have any of the depth to him that you want him too. Also their chemistry Together just doesn\\'t work and you just really do not buy it at all. The rest of bowdies crew were just as boring as he was and you won\\'t care about there relationships with Utah as the film develops. The only performances I liked were ray winstone and Utah\\'s police captain who I thought were both decent additions but they aren\\'t given enough to do in this film for you to really care. The story is completely non existent, it is less compelling because the characters and their relationships are so dull and unbelievable that you will not care about anybody or anything in the film. The script has absolutely no depth to it and none of the dialogue was gripping in anyway. The style had some really cool extreme sports that are really well filmed but I don\\'t need to watch this film to watch to watch good extreme sports so it needs to do more an the film just doesn\\'t do anything more. Overall this film is definitely not worth a watch and go and watch the original point break because it is so good. Let\\'s put aside the asinine logic that went into the decision to remake Point Break to begin with. Let\\'s just focus for a moment on whether or not they produced a good movie, regardless of whether it was an original idea or not. When we do that I think most of us can agree they failed miserably. This is a boring, unengaging movie in every way. The two leads are lacking in any charisma or appeal. They are both just so dull and lifeless I cannot begin to understand how they were cast in an action movie, let alone a remake of a superior action movie with two leads that played well off each other. But these two being so boring fits the tone of the film, one of the more unexciting excuses for an action movie I\\'ve ever seen. The original Point Break was a fun movie. This thing is dire and seems to believe it has a message, which makes it even worse. It\\'s really just a lackluster movie all around. I guess the one positive it has over the original is that Teresa Palmer is nice to look at and the original movie just had Lori Petty. Point Break marks another blockbuster fizzer from Warner Bros., who after several flops is now in desperate need of a major hit. This is a useless, money-grabbing exercise that rides the name of an already overrated cult film as an excuse to stage pointless stunts. I\\'ll say this once: do not waste your money on this film. If you are a fan of the original Point Break by Kathryn Bigelow, the film where Patrick Swayze played a bank robbing surfer who took Keanu \\'I am an FBI agent\\' Reeves under his wing, watch that film again. If you are in the mood for crazy stunts and set pieces, open YouTube and watch some extreme sports videos on there. These are comparatively sound alternatives to this dreck, courtesy of director Ericson Core who has made his first film since 2006. It might take another nine years and extensive therapy to overcome this stain. The film is so bad and amateurishly composed that it appears someone first listed off a series of extreme stunts and told Core and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (Salt) to write the movie around them no matter how jarring or ill-fitting they may seem. If you\\'re still wondering, the stunts don\\'t work on their own because the script\\'s lousiness makes them boring since there\\'s no investment in the one- dimensional characters and the weak performances of the actors.No thought went into planning this narrative. It starts with two motocross riders jumping between rock faces. One of them is Utah (Australian actor Luke Bracey), who watches as his friend falls to his death. The film forwards seven years to when Utah has joined the FBI and is under the watch of Instructor Hall (Delroy Lindo), who doubts Utah\\'s commitment and calls him son a lot. Since Utah was once a motocross rider in the extreme sports circle, he magically has the background information about the activity of the dangerous gang of extreme sports criminals Hall is chasing. It\\'s mega stupid and as contrived as the stunts themselves. The gang, best described as a hodgepodge of philosophers, hippies, extremists and Mountain Dew sports stars, is performing a ritual called the Osaki 8. The Osaki 8 involves eight different extreme sports trials, some of which are criminal activities but others are plain stunts including surfing and mountain climbing. The transition between these set pieces is embarrassing. When Utah bombs out in an early surfing attempt, the gang saves him from drowning by bringing him onto their boat. He\\'s recognised as a famous motocross rider from all those years ago but everyone, at least at this point, is oblivious that this not-exactly-inconspicuous surfer dude has been training as a cop and is allowed to freely explore the boat of the gang leader Bodhi (Joy\\'s Édgar Ramírez). The other members of the gang, including Teresa Palmer as a brief love interest, barely register at all so you won\\'t give two hoots about them and they aren\\'t even smart enough to background check Utah before initiating him. More criminal than the stunts is how Ray Winston as Utah\\'s partner Pappas, a potentially good replacement for Gary Busey\\'s comic relief character, is inconsequential through much of the film except when questioning if Utah is overly enjoying the gang life. But since we don\\'t care about the other gang members, what\\'s the point in blurring the two lines of the law?Does every blockbuster have to be self-serious now because it worked so well in the Nolan Batman films? Whereas Bigelow\\'s film meshed action and comedy, this remake doesn\\'t have a funny side at all. Instead, Bodhi\\'s long, boring monologues about giving back to the earth (what?) are serious delusions this film has about becoming meaningful. But even watching the film solely for the stunts is futile. The film\\'s marketing has emphasised how the stunts are performed by actual stuntmen as opposed to employing special effects. But given the stunts often have nothing to do with the gang\\'s criminal activities, like the surfing, gliding and snowboarding sequences, we\\'re watching a stunt showcase that\\'s completely aloof from the plot. Similarly, the apparent realism of the stunts is malarkey since some are about as plausible as a Looney Tune\\'s cartoon. Driving down mountain slopes ahead of an avalanche, through a dense forest on bikes and climbing mountains with just his bare hands will make you think that the FBI has really intensified its training or Utah has spent a lot of time with the Avengers. The only good things about the film are its brief reference to the bank robber masks of the original and that this boring pile falls under the two hour mark. It\\'s a small victory for anyone who is foolish enough to pay money to see it. I lied and will reiterate: don\\'t pay money to see this because you\\'re only encouraging movies like this with boring action and such carelessness towards the story. It\\'s a black eye to the fans of the original who might have given this disaster a chance. The original was a great movie with classic actors. Sure it\\'s dated today, but still carries it\\'s own weight. This movie while containing some visually stunning cinematography, some how manages to just drag and drag. As others have commented it comes of like a commercial. The special affects don\\'t seem that special. It\\'s like you are watching a commercial with snowboarding and sky diving designed to sell Redbull. While I should be in awe at what they are doing on screen, i find myself yawning and wondering when is it all just going to end. There is no real tension building, no sense of fear that Utah will be discovered, unlike the original, where his cover was about to be blown with each scene. I highly recommend passing on this one, it\\'s a borefest. Point break (the 2015 remake) is the single worse remake in the history of remakes. The original point break was a solid B rated movie making this remake at best an F. I mean I\\'ve seen a lot of remakes and this is the worst movie I\\'ve ever seen. In fact I honestly felt relieved when the credits started rolling. Its funny because they want ten lines just to leave a review. While I could see this working on the average movie this doesn\\'t not work for Point Break (2015). The movie is so bad there\\'s few words that can express this. I feel like a teacher is wanting me to write something positive about the end of the world. There is nothing positive about it or this movie. On the plus side I\\'ve drug this on to the ten required lines and I can put the movie behind me and pretend I didn\\'t waste part of my life watching it. Its too late for me, but please save yourself and don\\'t watch this movie. Sometimes mere words cannot describe something adequately, and in the case of 2015\\'s utterly pointless and mind dumbing/daft Point Break remake there are quite literally no words I can summon from the shelves of my undoubtedly mediocre storage system of the English language to pinpoint just how idiotic, stupid and unintentionally hilarious this film is.Making Kathryn Bigalow\\'s well-liked 1991 original seem like a work of Shakespeare, Ericson Core\\'s update of the relatively simple story of fun-loving FBI agent Johnny Utah infiltrating a group of extreme sports enthusiasts that happen to be criminals is here turned into some type of \"giving back to nature\" eco conscious athletes that just happen to like messing with the rich corporations ruining mother nature (don\\'t even try to understand the Osaki 8 that keeps popping up here) and Johnny Utah is turned into a clearly Australian, motocross riding, badly tattooed (seriously how many tattooed people can be in one movie?) agent that gets to to be involved in one of the most hilarious on screen deaths in some time (in the film\\'s opening 5 minutes!) and somehow possesses even less charisma than Keanu Reeves (yes, the unthinkable has occurred). But if you think lame motocross related deaths and dodgy eco warriors are the worst of this films problems, then think again.Director Core and his team seemingly sat down at a table and in the space of 30 or so minutes designed a serious of supposedly breathtaking stunts that span the globe and while they look great in a location sense, the actual transpiring of events are so downright unbelievable that any sense of fun or excitement is taken away by the fact it\\'s just too daft to care.From downhill snowboarding, random unnecessarily dangerous rock climbing, perfectly used wing suit fly byes, an exploding rock strewn mountain face and perhaps worst of all, a reimaging of the wave clad finale of the original, Point Break seems intent on becoming some type of hybrid of Fast and the Furious but forgets to make sure that the occurrences happening here are indeed fun and frenetic, rather than overdone and frequently unengaging.At the end of the day one could go on and one about the many failures of Point Break but none of it comes as a surprise, as from the moment this remake was announced and then from the very first glimpses of the films atrocious trailer no one expected this waste of $100 million dollars plus to be anything more than a disposable piece of Hollywood trash. With no heart, no soul and with a bunch of uninvolving characters, this film is a waste of time that gets a bonus mark for its intrigue factor as a solidified sunken ship, it\\'s just a shame it took down two up and coming Australian actors in the form of Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer with it.1 mink blanket out of 5 \"Point Break\" is what \"Crusty Demons\" ought to be. Unfortunately, it is not what \"Point Break\" ought to be. In fairness, the extreme sports scenes are pretty awesome. The cinematography is crystal-clear and the exotic locations are picturesque. As an extreme sports video, it excels. As an action movie or caper, it is less impressive. The greatest problem is that none of the characters are particularly likable or charismatic. Personally, I think one major problem is the horrendous tattoos that most of the central characters sport over much of their bodies. Having worked as a photographer and cinematographer, I am no fan of tattoos. To me, they suggest low-class, criminal background, lack of self-respect and many other negative character traits. There are some tattoos that are inoffensive, even impressive – but not in this movie. When I see these tattoos, my first reaction is that I have never been that drunk or that stupid or uncultured. In the original, Bodhi\\'s crew had goals and motives that made sense. Here, we have a group of athletes with improbable skills, all of whom share an exotic philosophy and a disdain for profit. The surf Nazi red herrings are gone, as is Utah\\'s need to acquire skills in order to join the group. The whole Utah-Bodhi bromance seems less credible and less compelling. The antagonists are cast as eco-warriors; however, somehow it doesn\\'t make them sympathetic. They are financed by an eccentric multi-billionaire, which seems more contrived than organic. At one point, the FBI had very strict standards for its agents. They were expected to dress and conduct themselves in conformance with relatively conservative standards. The notion that the FBI would accept a long-haired, extensively tattooed candidate stretches credulity to the limits, as does much of the rest of the film. However, as a direct-to-video extreme sports video, it would be quite impressive. When you go to the cinema to see an action movie, usually you do not expect something really engaging. Most of such productions do not appear as very original nor extraordinary. Although, from time to time, we can also find some surprising scores, wchich rebuild our ruined fate in greedy Hollywood producers. They go down into our memory. Many times, we want to re-watch them again, again and again one more time. One of such movies is Kathryn Bigelow\\'s \\x84Point Break\" from 1999. Unfortunately, same words can\\'t be said about the Core\\'s Newest \\x84Point Break\" by Ericson Core is such a schematic and predictable, as every movie created only for visual effects, wchich have been so important for screenwriters. However, the plot seems to be only a minor supplement. Who cares, right? So, what do we get here? A threadbare story, wchich tries to stole as much as it\\'s possible from the original. Young FBI agent, with embarrassing past, must infiltrate the mysterious organization suspected of many crimes, committed with the help of their amazing sport skills. Do you fill familiar with this description? By replacing some words, you could easily come with a conclusion that many action movies are the same, for example \\x84The Fast and the Furious\" and also Bigelow\\'s \\x84Point Break\". Thanks to the forceful action sequence pictures and technics how they were taken, we may partly forget about mediocre plot. It looks like, Core hasn\\'t known about that. And he probably still doesn\\'t. Because of that, his \\x84Point Break\" is more condensed around crass plot, rather than around extreme sports.Such things like crazy and dangerous stunts on surfboards and snowboards, motocross rides and jumps from planes have been reduced to minimum. These are a few scenes, wchich have turned out really all right. It shouldn\\'t be a big surprise, because Core was a director of photography at such productions as \\x84The Fast and the Furious\" and 2003\\'s \\x84Daredevil\", what gave him a necessary experience in this field. Although, it doesn\\'t mean, that he should have neglected all the other features of the movie like good plot or characters. All of these features are only the caricatures of their archetypes from 1999, without any natures, starred by the stiff actors. They look more like the sect of insane ecologists, rather than a division of athletes.New version of \\x84Point Break\" ignores every kind of basic elements of good movie: well-written plot, interesting characters and most of all a dynamic action. It\\'s one of the worst kind of productions, wchich creators hopped that, a few good action scenes would build up the whole film. Unfortunately, they were mistaken. It doesn\\'t work like this. I watched this movie as an inmate at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. I am in love with this movie. A lot of people don\\'t appreciate it, but it is one of the few movies in the world that tries to capture the feeling of being fearless. It succeeds on multiple fronts for me, and the cinematography and timing is superb. You get to go places that you probably will never go in your life time. I think people who are used to sitting on their couches and critiquing movies are making the reviews. You should not listen to them. This movie is a must-see, an experience of things few people will ever do in their lifetime, and yet... there are people doing them.What does it feel like to be truly free? It requires not only the external circumstance of being able to do \"what you want\" to do. It requires physical fitness, stamina, and your own inner choice to be free, regardless of the constraints of society. Doing what you believe and choose against all odds, taking the consequences for your actions, and then to know what it is to live without fear. FEARLESS.How many fearless people are reviewing this movie? There are few in the world, my friend, and I am one of them. This movie resonates with me for that reason. Point Break was rebooted in 2001, it was called The Fast and the Furious where the surfing was replaced by street car racing.This remake sees extreme sports athlete Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) who after losing a friend when a motocross stunt goes wrong goes on to become a FBI agent some years later. His boss Hall (Delroy Lindo) sends him to investigate a series of elaborate heists from a gang who behave like Robin Hood robbers.Utah believes that the group are taking part in the Ozaki 8, eight spiritually extreme sport challenges that coincide with the daring robberies. Utah infiltrates the gang which is led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez.)In its own right the film starts brightly enough with plenty of CGI enhanced action but later on the film actually comes to a stop in the non action sequences when the characters just talk. The film then becomes boring and after a while even the action scenes just get duller. The colour grading is awful making the film look cheap despite the international locations.The original Point Break directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who would go on to become the first female Oscar winning director found a zeitgeist of Generation X sports action thriller with well staged action sequences. Although not the greatest actors around, Bigelow got charismatic turns from Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze and sturdy support from Gary Busey as Reeves FBI boss.The remake lacks all of this even though it tried to go on a new direction. I tried to give it a break and approached it with an open mind but alas it is a poor film. The actors and director of this re-make of a classic action film must have gone home after making it singing Dierks Bentley\\'s song \"What Was I Thinking?\" ...It is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT to anyone who is a fan of the original.But like most classic movie re-makes, the entire team hired to make this flick completely screwed it up. Too much to complain about, and I am usually very forgiving., but this movie just plain sucked. I\\'m glad Patrick Swayze wasn\\'t alive to see this pos re-make.For one, the plot doesn\\'t even come close to the original - just a few sad, lame-ass attempts to link it to the original classic 1991 film in order to call the movie by the same name, such as stealing and inserting scenes like: - re-using all the main character\\'s names - Johnny shooting into the sky when he fails to kill Bodhi - Bodhi escaping and having to die by a monster-wave at the end.Ray Winstone\\'s talent is completely wasted playing Pappas, and is probably embarrassed his name is now associated with this mess.... there is so many more example of this it is ridiculous.So other than calling this flick by the same name of the original classic, and inserting these stolen scenes and names from the original, the movie is something, but it isn\\'t POINT BREAK.In the end, it\\'s just an excuse for some self-serving, over-rated, uber-tattooed actors to get a woody playing extreme-sport idiots, and some adrenaline-junky film makers to get their rocks off filming stupid stunts in exotic locations.If your an extreme sports fanatic and don\\'t give a crap about plots, themes, or just a decent action flick, then grab your favorite power-bar and energy-drink and watch it while downing your steroids.But is you are a true fan of the original Swayze-Reeves 1991 classic POINT BREAK, and were hoping this might be even half the movie the original, you will very, very disappointed.The studio execs should have just called this mess NO POINT or GIVE ME A BREAK, because there is absolutely no point in watching this piece of crap excuse for a film. This movie is not boring at all and it\\'s full of well done action sequences and it\\'s absolutely worth watching Fortunately, I\\'m an extreme sports enthusiast n i love rock climbing n mountain biking. It has the most spectacular visuals of surfing, snowboarding, rock climbing, wing-suiting, bike stunts, etc. The director Erickson Core himself did the cinematography. Hes an amateur director but veteran cinematographer. No wonder the film has exceptional cinematography with setting like surfing in the middle of the ocean, Angel falls and the Alps. The movie has remarkable camera work, the film was able to capture every crucial move with acute depth. I was not expecting Oscar worthy performances. Edgar Ramírez got a strong screen presence n he did a good job. It delivered what I expected. Its my kinda action flick. I hate those super hero films, except Nolan\\'s Batman trilogy. Well story-wise this is just a mediocre movie, but the stunts and scenery make the 1 hour and 45 minutes worth the watch for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing. I know and understand what goes through the minds of extreme sports enthusiasts and why they do it. U cannot call it a remake of the original classic. It\\'s jus inspired by the original. obviously this heap of garbage of a movie was an attempt at a money grab on the name of a mildly successful well known Point Break movie. 1st off, like the original the acting was pretty horrible. 2nd, unlike the original the screen play was awful. Things are just pieced together, no real story line of any realistic or logical conclusions. They really tried way to hard in this movie and it flopped. You need more than some extreme sport scenes to make a movie cool. This movie lacked any sort of real character development, any interest to pull the viewer in other than some nicely shot scenes. It\\'s mostly Hollywood drivel. It\\'s a shame they wasted such a huge budget on this movie, although I\\'m sure the extreme athletes who performed the stunts appreciated the pay check from it. I would skip this movie. Go watch the original it\\'s better written, better acted (that\\'s saying a lot) and a more interesting movie. So many terrible reviews! Why such negativity? I\\'ve seen this film 9 times and counting. It\\'s so beautiful. It\\'s cinematic poetry! Point Break is a cautionary tale because the eco-warriors rebellion only leads to destruction of others and self. It\\'s the paradox of humankind - good and wicked all in one. Please watch with an open mind! Also, I find the extreme-sports-nature sequences breathtaking and beautiful and full of high energy action. There are also some inspiring ideals along the way: \"the break point, the point where fear becomes master and you the slave...\" I understand Core\\'s approach and Kurt Wimmer\\'s screen-writing logic: a story of friendship with a crazy philosophical twist and rebellion turned into criminal. The natural wonders are fantastic! Huge surf waves, Alps, and Angel Falls. Yes I\\'m biased... I\\'m from Venezuela, and I think Edgard Ramirez did a spectacular job with his character and Angel Falls are magnificent! Luke Bracey as Johnny Utah is heartfelt and charismatic. Roach, Chowder, Grommet, Pappas, and Samsara were great too. All straightforward and minimal dialogue. Did you know that the climbing of Auyantepui was real? The line and bolts were digitized out, but it was and experience of a lifetime for these climbers. Chris Sharma, Peter Croft, and Dany Andrada were the stunt doubles. The behind-the-scenes video is astounding! One big mistake? To have marketed this movie as a remake of Point Break 1991: it\\'s inspired by it but another story. And yes, there are problems with the plot and character development, but that\\'s because the focus is on the visual story more than dialogue. Another major problem is that the writing and the dialogue lines are too abstract and metaphoric and ambiguous. It\\'s not clear at times what Bodhi means or what Johnny Utah wants. I think I got it and I enjoyed the film, but I can see how it can be confusing to audiences. Teresa Palmer\\'s lines too are full of philosophical ideas that sound abstract as well. In this version, Bodhi is a protégé of Osaki, a fictionalized eco-warrior with the idea of saving Earth by performing 8 ordeals (this is the fiction). But Osaki was killed by a whaling ship when he was \"giving back\"... Later, Bodhi follows Osaki\\'s steps, but he has taken the wrong path. Bohdi wants to accomplish his 8-ordeals to become one with the Earth and give back through criminal/sabotage acts. However, there\\'s good in Bodhi, for he saves Utah\\'s life for some unknown compassionate reason(??). Perhaps Osaki saved Bodhi\\'s life once just like in Utah\\'s situation? It would\\'ve been great to see the setup story for Bodhi as well. Yet, Bodhi is determined and he doesn\\'t care he is killing people and destroying assets when he \"gives back to Earth.\"Without the crime, these guys would be extreme-sports crusaders for mother Earth\\'s wonders: which would be a whole different story - perhaps I\\'ll write a new Point Break screenplay inspired by this version of Point Break (I\\'m a screen writing student). Then we have Johnny Utah, a former extreme-sports turned FBI agent, but we don\\'t learn why he specifically joins the FBI. The film would have benefited from additional minutes to set up the characters better and explore their deeper emotional motives. That\\'s what\\'s lacking. Utah goes undercover to find out why these extreme-athletes are committing crimes, only to get too involved to be able to stop them: part of Utah relishes in the chaos and he enters into a conflict with himself. Utah however, is the perfect agent to pursue the extreme-sports criminals. But his longing for the sport and his gratitude to Bodhi are stronger than his FBI mission. And worse yet for the mission: Utah has a soft-heart and Bodhi knows that. Utah owes him his life. Utah is in a great dilemma - apprehend and kill the very person that saved his life?In the end, the power of gratitude and kindness prevails in Utah. And he gets back his passion for life. And the bad guys find their fate...Enjoy. Best wishes. Based on the motion Picture Point Break (1991)? Well yeah, by name and character-names. Every time I heard names like Bodhi on Utah I wanted to hurl. Why was this movie made? It\\'s got a lot of action, but everyone who has seen original Point Break is disgusted by this movie. The group who was robbing banks in the original, \"the dead presidents\" are Eco warriors in the new movie \"freeing\" money instead of robbing it. Characters Utah and Bodhi never bond like in the original movie and it makes the whole experience shallow and meaningless. The girl Utah falls in the original, is an mentor and a teacher to Utah, and in the new movie she is just a junkie. Point Break 2015 should\\'ve been a movie called Adrenaline Rush with different character-names. It would have been better picture with names like Jim and Bob than Bodhi and Utah.Do not make remakes that make no sense please?']}"

       "'What an excellent film by Rian Johnson; definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time! Nothing was typical about this. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow, the scenario, everything.\\nI highly recommend it for mystery lovers, for anyone who wants to watch a good movie! This is a movie one would not regret spending money on. After a long time I am rating a movie perfect 10 and this movie totally deserves it. I really like the subtle comedy sprinkled in the movie. It easies out the tense atmosphere. In a good detective movie, you expect to be taken aback on how things unfold at the end and this is what happens in this movie. There is never an instant when you would get distracted or bored. I had a good time watching this movie and you would surely have it too. With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with \"Knives Out\", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It\\'s abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie\\'s typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of \"Knives Out\" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan\\'s bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. \"Knives Out\" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn\\'t deserve all this hatred from disappointed \"Star Wars\" geeks) As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can\\'t go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre. Best movie of the year, love everything about it, what I\\'m seeing is that some trolls that still can\\'t get over TLJ, now for those that have and give it a 1 well that\\'s fair but have some reasons why, not just bc it\\'s Rian Johnson, like stop it\\'s childish I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn\\'t live up to it for me. But I thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I\\'m not sorry I spent some money on this one. Let me start by saying that the film is good. It\\'s a solid murder mystery and I\\'ll make sure I watch Knives Out 2 when it comes out. All I kept hearing about this film was that it was hilarious and brilliant and \\'so damn good\\' etc etc etc. I usually take these sorts of reactions with a grain of salt but, having seen the trailer and seeing how great the cast was, I bought into the hype. It looked so stylish, so compelling.\\nI really got my hopes up, and I can\\'t help thinking I would have enjoyed the film far more if I hadn\\'t been inundated with so many reviews heralding it as some brilliant masterpiece.\\nI was expecting a lot of laughs and whilst I did laugh on occasion, I didn\\'t laugh nearly as much as I was hoping I would. A film like this would have benefited from some black humor (maybe Rian could have co-written the film wish a British comedy writer for some more quality laughs... Phoebe Waller Bridge, perhaps?)\\nI enjoyed the scenes when the whole family was together and interacting with each other and I wish the film spent more time on them instead of opting for that ridiculous car chase and several other scenes that took me out of the whodunnit atmosphere.\\nOverall, this film is a solid good time, entertaining, clever and well acted and written but, in my opinion, definitely doesn\\'t live up to the hype. I have read the many glowing reviews for this film and I honestly don\\'t get it. Yes, there were some very funny and entertaining parts. It was a very good ensemble cast. Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the \"murder\" was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying \"Random, you\\'re back AGAIN\" or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the \"slayer\" law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn\\'t there be at least some surprises?Nor do I believe this is a \"commentary\" on our situation today. Yes, there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.That is not to say it is a bad film. Daniel Craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball. Lots of kooky things happened. But I think this is better for a late-nite Netflix watch.I certainly don\\'t see it as being \"best of the year.\" I went into this film with high expectations to say the least. I had heard so many good things about it, so it was built up in my mind as this phenomenal murder mystery movie, but it fell short. Where do I begin? Daniel Craig has this southern accent that just does not come across as convincing, not annoying, but not convincing. The main character of the film, Marta, potrayed by Ana de Armas, has this very unbelievable physiological condition in which she vomits every time that she tells a lie. I mean, come on people. This vomiting \\'tool\\' is used multiple times throughout the film to figure out the truth about some of the other characters in the story. Let\\'s just say that she vomits excessively until the credits start to roll.Now, the part of this film that really upset me was the \\'big reveal\\' at the end. It is revealed at the end that detective Benoit Blanc knew about the blood stain on Marta\\'s shoe the whole time. The biggest issue with this reveal is why he didn\\'t ask her about it. He would have known her involvment in the murder the whole time. Why didn\\'t he get the blood spot on her shoe tested? That would have easily put her in the room with Harlan when he died.Overall, the movie was entertaining up until we are revealed what happened between Marta and Harlan. Once I found out how Harlan died, I started to lose interest. It basically lost the \\'mystery\\' quality once that happened. The story went flat after that but then took off when new developments started to happen. The reason I give this movie a 6/10 is because I was able to figure out things about the story right away, which left me disappointed, and the blood spot made me question a majority of the movie. It wasn\\'t a bad watch, but I don\\'t think I will be watching it again. Being a middle aged Englishman I\\'ve been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I\\'ve been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of \\'Knives Out\\' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it\\'s cleverer than it is. It\\'s simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming \\'I am woke\\' at the top of his lungs at anybody who\\'ll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you\\'d not be any less aware of what\\'s happening. A bit of a shame really. I\\'m a mystery lover and have seen and read every Agatha Christie tale. I found this movie very slow for the first half. Second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit, nor the charm and period atmosphere of a Poirot episode (which I can watch over and over - thank you David Suchet and the other main actors). The lead actress was very attractive, but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch, as well as ridiculously unbelievable (I guess that was the funny part?). Some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather-beaten. Did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. The last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid-fire conclusion thank the Lord. Agree that Daniel Craig with that southern accent was just super annoying. Great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat. Over and over. It moved pretty slowly for me at times. I guess I\\'m in a minority on this one. I\\'m not saying it was terrible but it was not a great movie for me. Mildly entertaining with a great cast and high production value. The story is soft but not awful. I can\\'t imagine saying this film deserves more than a 6. Knives out uses a really old idea, the \"whodunit\". Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don\\'t really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig\\'s amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don\\'t know much about Star Wars as I don\\'t really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don\\'t know what\\'s going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its\\' director. Looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious Oscar contender for multiple awards, while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls (?) etc. I\\'m confused. I say it\\'s nothing special and I\\'m not a Star Wars fanatic. I\\'ve never even seen the film people are so angry about, so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film, Knives Out.I definitely expected more. If it\\'s meant to be amusing, it pretty much failed on that score. This film would be better suited as a TV movie, if they even make them anymore, or something to pop up on Netflix. I didn\\'t pay to see it and I\\'d feel I\\'d wasted my money if I had.Visually it was enjoyable-I mean the location, the house, the production values. the family members were an unattractive bunch, so nothing to look at there. Daniel Craig\\'s \"southern\" accent became grating after awhile, and I was squirming a bit with boredom, waiting for it to be over. And, when it was, my reaction was \"So what? Who cares?\" I can hardly remember any of it and I just watched it in the last couple of hours.Convoluted, unrealistic and tedious, like a lot of Agatha Christie stories. How this has ended up on some people\\'s Best Films of 2019 lists is beyond me. It was okay; nothing special. Knives Out (2019)\\n8/10🗡🚪💉💸\"Rian Johnson successfully revives the \"whodunnit\" mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time, even if it doesn\\'t bring anything groundbreaking to the table.\"Knives Out is the kind of \"whodunnit\" film that will never fail to entertain. As a progressive mystery, Knives Out is a very fashionable movie with it\\'s grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. With some very snarky and slick writing, these characters are albeit memorable, most notably Daniel Craig\\'s Detective Blanc and Chris Evan\\'s Ransome, however, the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson\\'s strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it\\'s footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.Verdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways. GENERAL REVIEW\\nGoing in, I was expecting an energetic Edgar Wright feel, and complex Sherlock Holmes mystery in which the audience tries to solve it at the same time. What I got was a cookie cutter \\'mystery\\' that was different from others in its genre only in its use of bright colours, rather than any sort of trope and convention subversion or parody.SPOILER TIMEIn regards to acting, Christopher Plummer, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans gave great performances. 0 complaints for the main 3, I thoroughly enjoyed Harlan and Marta\\'s scenes. There are more than 3 members of the cast, of which I have complaints; Jamie Lee Curtis and Micheal Shannon among others gave performances that seemed to change personalities every few lines, probably due to Rian Johnson\\'s directing. Don Johnson was good, LaKeith Stanfield was not, others were mediocre or just less.\\nSpecial Daniel Craig section. Daniel Daniel Daniel. What was that. The screenplay reads \"Blanc ... speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have ever heard in your life.\" That is not what I was forced to listen to. The accent was very distracting and I could only hope for a case of Stockholm syndrome that never came. His character was meant to act as an absurdist archetype satire of the noir detective, but instead he came across as an annoying detective who did not diverge from the archetypal role. If that didn\\'t bother you then it would have been a good performanceAs mentioned I was expecting more Edgar Wright-esque editing and cinematography that the trailer promised me.Overall, the writing is very basic, being a typical murder mystery. I am unsure if you can even call it a murder mystery when you find out the truth a quarter through. Throughout the story, there were many setups with minimal or no payoff, e.g. shoe blood, where is Marta from (Harlan should have commented to Ransom during their fight where she is from). There were also too many inconsistencies, like how the stairs did not actually make a noise every time, some people went up with a noise and down without because Rian Johnson forgot.\\nFor the final reveal; Marta must be especially talented to feel \"tincture and viscosity\" of vials, a quality you might be able to feel when you are drawing a syringe, but she had made the choice already which solution to use, maybe density or weight would be acceptable but the given explanation of her being such a good person that her vail choice was correct is pretty dumb. Also, the shots for Fran\\'s last words were different, where she said \"you did this\" in the scene and first flashback, but \"Hugh did this\" in the last. These 2 issues detract from the fun of watching murder mysteries, in which an audience should be able to find the killer if they have been paying attention, instead the script pretended like you should have known these facts.\\nThe suspect game instead was played by cast knowledge. By looking at the cast you can see it\\'s either Jamie Lee Curtis, Micheal Shannon or Chris Evans, personally I guessed Micheal Shannon due to his typecasting, but when I realised that all 3 of Harlan\\'s children where the same character, with different jobs, it was then obviously the built up character named Ransom. Ransom. His name is Ransom.This leads me to one of my main critiques: Unnecessary characters. Despite all 3 of Harlan\\'s children being the same, the \"nazi kid\" served 1 purpose that could have easily been delivered by another character, the granddaughter, Katherine Langford served a whopping 2 purposes that all together could have been dropped and exchanged. There were 2 cops and Blanc for some reason, of which the comedic policeman was not funny.Lastly, too many convenient devices like the stairs that made a noise \\'every time\\', Marta vomiting when she lies, the dogs choosing to like and dislike people, or the various murder mystery cliches that excuse themselves through being self aware (secret doors and prop knives) I actually wish  would do away with the star-rating portion of their website because it doesn\\'t give an accurate rating for films and this film is a perfect example. Everyone knows that there are many bitter Star Wars fanboys rating this film low because they are still so bitter over Rian Johnson\\'s The Last Jedi and as a result, they are going to try to ruin any of Rian\\'s future films. They really need to just get over it and get a life, already. DON\\'T believe the Star-Rating of This Film Because It\\'s Mostly from Bitter Star Wars Fanboys Rating the Film LOW ON PURPOSE!, obviously. Anyone who has actually seen this film would be brain-dead to rate it low or to not give it a good review because this film is so freaking entertaining! I could see it again and again. It\\'s so different than the crap that has been in the theaters lately. It\\'s fun, it\\'s thrilling, it\\'s wacky, it has so many twists and turns that it always keeps you guessing. And for the cast, what a freaking cast! I couldn\\'t even tell you who the MVP of the cast was. They were all fantastic. We need more films like this and less big explosions, stupid plot films. I for one, will give this the true star-rating it deserves! 10/10!!!!! Bitter Star Wars fanboys, you can keep being immature and rating it low, but it isn\\'t going to change the fact that the film is great and I\\'m going to encourage every single person to go out and see it pronto when it hits theaters! Generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery TV shows than movies, this is partially since it\\'s hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time.\\nThis movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects. It has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details mid-movie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute.\\nThe acting was brilliant and I didn\\'t feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage. Have to say I was a little disappointed by this, not because it isn\\'t good. Arguably it is, but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good, which it isn\\'t. So as with so many films your experience & enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.Overall I think nearly everyone will enjoy this, particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated CGI. Having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of Hollywood. One of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath, but not always beneath, the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it\\'s difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie, which without giving too much away it ultimately does.What is genuinely enjoyable is Daniel Craig\\'s slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match. The rest of the cast features some big names, but unfortunately as others have pointed out they don\\'t always have that much to do. Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is Don Johnson.The Plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all, and while it\\'s quite good, it isn\\'t that good or that original. The key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable (for the record I didn\\'t work out who did it, but did work out the mechanism involved). If one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement Knives Out falls somewhat short. A part of the problem is that for much of the film it isn\\'t clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place. In the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister.Perhaps the best aspect of the film, aside of Daniel Craig, was the fact that the Johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy & the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller. I\\'ll probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I\\'d have to say I probably enjoyed Adam Sandler & Jennifer Aniston\\'s Murder Mystery more than this, including with regard to the solution. Knives Out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it - or anyone else I\\'d venture - thinks it is. Still enjoyable though Really boring for the most time. Lots of wasted potential. I don\\'t understand the nomination and positve reviews. It\\'s just an OK movie. A missed opportunity to do something better. The movie plays like the worst episode of COLUMBO you have ever seen, only this time it features Daniel Craig attempting to imitate Foghorn Leghorn. Learn from my mistake and avoid this turkey. Others have mentioned the old house might have held some secrets (it didn\\'t). Or that it might present a more structured \"Whodunit\" that leaves you guessing (it didn\\'t). Or that the main character might offer a bit of verve, cleverness or pizazz, that might have livened up the whole affair (she doesn\\'t, at all).I also take some issue with the director\\'s choices in scene framing, especially in the beginning. There should have been more close-ups, and better initial intros for each character\\'s little idiosyncrasies so we would could warm up to them. I simply don\\'t care for how it was shot; it\\'s terribly pedestrian. The fast, quick edits of the trailer are totally absent! There\\'s something missing here. Todd Solondz, Tim Burton or the Cohen Brothers really could have drawn these characters out more and given the actors something real to work with.I thought it would sparkle with a bit more witty, dark humor. It wasn\\'t quite as funny or snappy as I was expecting it to be. Instead, it settles on delivering more of a \"message\" about this girl, who does good, while the others do bad.There\\'s also no need for Daniel Craig\\'s poor Southern accent. He should have just done a British accent, it would have been fine and enjoyable, maybe given the film a bit more weight it seems it was shooting for, in the end, with its messaging.Additional viewings might reveal there\\'s more to it, but I suspect such might reveal there\\'s less. A Stella cast carrying a whodunit will depend entirely on the story... Sadly, instead of \"the plot thickens\", it thins out unbearably...Overall the movie was entertaining enough to watch... But the plot was stretched a little thin and the ending was disappointing...A whodunit works by bringing the audience along to try to figure out the crime and be pleasantly surprised at the big reveal... This movie decided at the half way point that it no longer wants to be a whodunit and we no longer should follow along as it does its own thing... Sigh...I wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone who truly enjoy the genre..Spoiler Alert...Let\\'s tackle the minor annoyances first...1) The beginning sets everyone out as having a motive to murder... Standard for the genre but here, it stops there...No building up of everyone/anyone who also had the opportunity to commit the murder... Motive without opportunity doesn\\'t add up to murder...This means... Before the middle of the story, we have already eliminated almost everyone as the suspect... Which kinda defeats the whodunit plotline...2) Having a girl who is a witness who vomits if she lies is extremely convenient for a murder detective... And... Surely any investigator will target her for as much information as possible...Here however, to preserve the big reveal later I guess, they let her off without ever really questioning her...(even Ransom got more information than the investigators did...)In fact, the detectives were more interested in talking to Benoit and kept telling her to go away after finding out this rather beneficial condition...This leaves a feeling of a weak plot that cannot exclude her from some crucial events...She didn\\'t have to witness the suicide... Which in itself didn\\'t add anything to the story... And with that, she could spill the beans on what she did and we can all still believe there was further foul play involved...3) Marta and Benoit find the hidden tox report after spending hours to chase it down... Yet they can sit down to have a chat after finding it but neither even opened it to take a look?This gives us the scene where she was about to confess in front of the whole family but was stopped in mid sentence... Drama!!!!That\\'s ridiculous and again feels forced/false...4) Walt confronts Marta at her home... He evades the horde of reporters and came in via the back way...Firstly, a rich guy like him would likely never have to use the back way and wouldn\\'t be able to find one...Secondly, Walt is the \\'boss\\' of a printing empire and it\\'s unreasonable that nobody in the media recognises him...Thirdly, he walks/limps with a cane...Is he really the best person to go seek Marta out under the circumstance?\\nWouldn\\'t Meg, Donna or Jacob be better suited for the stealth-required mission?5) Captain frigging America... Emm, I mean Ransom... When he left and came back, wouldn\\'t that be recorded in the early part of the surveillance video? He stopped exactly where she stopped...Ok, this one, maybe I can accept the reason is he knows the area well and was able to evade detection... Still unsatisfying though...6) Fran wants to confront Ransom believing he killed Harlan...a woman, confronting a man/killer even if he\\'s not Captain America, surely wouldn\\'t choose an abandoned/creepy location to meet..What does she think will happen? This is not a slasher flick where dumb teenagers go into the room despite multiple warnings not to...7) Harlan was in a terrible rush to kill himself...Marta explained that he will die in\\n10 minutes... And at around the 5 minutes mark, he will sweat profusely and have some other symptoms...Wouldn\\'t a normal person wait until the symptoms start to show before reaching for the knife?\\nMany more minor niggles like Benoit not needing to introduce himself before sitting inside the house witnessing all the \\'interrogations\\'... -There seem to be no other maids or servants in such a huge, well maintained house, that needed to be questioned... -Marta just happens to have a large magnet in her pocket for erasing a video tape... -Nobody who wasn\\'t around needs to have an alibi for their whereabouts...-none of the other detectives see the blood stain on Marta\\'s shoe...Too many roll eyes moments for a whodunit plot...Now...Let\\'s get to the parts that killed the movie/story...1) Benoit doing his best Poirot... And gave too much details without any evidence...Examples...-He could simply say Ransom switched the medication.. But instead, he goes into details of how he sucked out medication from one bottle and then from the other bottle... How would he know that?-How did he deduce that it was Ransom who sent him the cash?-How can he be so sure that a person with dementia simply didn\\'t mix up \\'back\\' and \\'back again\\'... Very thin even if we can accept the inference...If he\\'s wrong at any point, Ransom could stop him and the story telling ends...These plus some other details he brought up without any evidence shows that he is just showboating and not very professional... He should be more mindful of his reputation... And this goes against his persona of being careful with what he says as shown in the beginning...2) the claim is that Ransom torched the examiners\\' office the night before... And yet in the morning light (actually around 9am already...) and the fire on that not-large building seem to just get going... In real life, it should be ashes before daylight... Unless it was touched an hour or two before 9am...Since Ransom was with Marta in the morning, he couldn\\'t have done it...3) we were told that overdose of morphine means dying in 10 minutes...When Marta found Fran, Ransom was in police custody and there was nobody else around... She should be the prime suspect...And obviously, Ransom couldn\\'t have done that too...4) in the scene where she makes her escape after the will reading...the family couldn\\'t stop her if she wanted to drive away... Richard said something like, what do you want me to do, bite the bumper?(to stop her leaving...)... But when she came out of the car, push through the crowd to get into Ransom\\'s car, not a single person stopped her getting in...This is of course essential for her to spend quality time with Ransom... Totally unrealistic...In conclusion...As said... Not bad entertainment (6-7) but a terrible whodunit (2-3)... So around 4.5 overall... This movie has an identity crisis; it can\\'t decide if it\\'s a thriller, mystery, drama, comedy or romance! As a result, it\\'s somewhat of a mess and difficult to sit through. It\\'s a shame because the acting is really good; the script just can\\'t keep up. Both the male and female leads were superb. Very talented actors who have huge careers ahead of them. The film was okay. His character was interesting. But the way he filmed guests was a little unbelievable and didn\\'t make sense. But I could ride with that. The story was a gentle run but with nothing of note to remember. I probably wouldn\\'t watch it again but I will be keen to see both the actors in something new. I recommend this film for a relaxed afternoon. Oh, and I think Helen Hunt is in it. Or someone who looks a bit like her. It\\'s rare you i find a movie i watch all through, let alone recommend to anyone, with that in mind, if you want to see a movie that is well acted, has a story that keeps your interest, is not predictable and has twists in the tale, you will find this worth a watch as a minimum. This one is a head scratcher....and by head scratcher i mean after the film is over you will scratch your head wondering why anyone would sign onto this movie. To say that the story was poorly conceived would be a an understatement. The movie goes absolutely no where and ultimately you\\'re left with a feeling of regret for how you chose to spend the last hour and a half of your lifeThe Good : Tye Sheridan\\'s performance as a high functioning man with Asperger\\'s , seeing John Leguizamo in something since John Wick Chapter 2 and a briefly topless Ana de ArmasThe Bad : Everything elseTLDR: Skip this one for sure See past the crime movie, see past the thiller, see past the hollywood. This movie was great with 2 incredible actors. If people don\\'t understand deeper meanings and symbolism. Don\\'t watch it. The problem with \\'The Night Clerk\\', and I\\'ve seen many films fall into this trap, is that it gives itself a really annoying lead character for the audience to have to follow and side with. Now there are two sides to that coin. One is that the character is unique and interesting to watch from a medical point of view, and that\\'s why the movie puts him there. But the other side of that coin is that it becomes really frustrating and hard to watch very quickly. It gives the film a point of difference, but a point of difference for the sake of it isn\\'t always enough.Tye Sheridan does a fantastic job playing the lead role. He nails Aspergers syndrome. Before it was ever mentioned in the film I was 100% certain that was what I was looking at. He keeps it up for the entire movie and never drops a scene either. The other cast member who really impressed me was Ana de Armas. I came to learn of her acting talents in \\'Knives Out\\' and she has impressed me again here. She didn\\'t have anything overly special to do in the film, but you could still tell she was a class above the rest.The film itself is a little obvious in what it is trying to set up and surprise the audience with. There\\'s one scene in particular that they thought they were being subtle with, but in reality it put all the cards on the table and gave the game away. Also there is a mystery element of sorts to the film that, had it been handled differently, could have been really interesting. Instead it was just clunky and petered out to dust by the end. I think the thing to watch this film for is Sheridan\\'s performance and as a character study of an Aspergers syndrome. Otherwise there isn\\'t a whole lot going for it. Before watching any movie, i\\'d always set lower expectation for the movie and it usually pays off. This movie is like that. You have to know what you\\'re getting into and you must know what your expectation.If you expect full blown mystery thriller like Primal Fear, prepare to be disappointed. But if you expect something to pass your free time with a short linear mystery thriller, this is the movie for you.The plot is quite monotonous with the only twist was at the end but it is what i\\'m expecting by reading the synopsis. It\\'s about an MC who have an asperger syndrom accused of murder. The focus is not whether he did it or not because i think it is pretty self explanatory during the scene. If you as many people expect this as the main focus of this movie, again, prepare to be disappointed. It is about how the MC want to prove that he\\'s innocent without the help of police, how he trapped all who\\'s involved or related to the murder that want to set him up but actually he know\\'s all along and how he set them up again.All in all, it\\'s not really that bad. I truly could not wait for this crap to end. First off, you got a hotel employee with Asperger with hidden cameras in the rooms watching guest? And it just so happens he witnesses a domestic violence incident? This was just so wrong on so many levels I don\\'t even know where to start. The minute the screen on my TV faded to black, I came here to warn you all, that this was utterly time wasted. I so don\\'t recommend it. The night clerk is socially awkward yet not very convincing as a person with Asperger\\'s syndrome. The story is dull, predictable and plods along at a snail\\'s pace. The poor acting of the lead, the silliness of the script and bad editing all combines to make this film difficult to watch through to the end. Very amateurish. No idea why they made this movie. It was slow, boring and predictable which is a kinder way of saying stupid. Its a film about autism spectrum disorder, a young man with high but ever so locked up mental capasity, who has vast compications connecting to other åeople. working as the night clerk at a hotel, he feels that he can control and surveil the environment, and as part of his self therapy, uses hidden cameras in the hotel rooms, just to practice how to interact with people, especially the female part of the guests. but as a crime occurs on his night watch, things become very dire for him.its a strange study into the head of a complicated person. its kinda rainman feeling rendering you while watching, at the same time its not. there are some confussionin the plot, the characters are pretty undeveloped, and its hard to say what reaaly happened in the end..seems to me they were in a hurry to get an end to the story,it could have been much better....the grumpy old man gives a 6 for the main cast, its a small recommend, and a joyridee if youre in the trade of working peoples heads.. Predictable or not, I found the acting great, and the story, a bittersweet reminder of how naive we used to be as well, or perhaps, still are sometimes. After reading the other users reviews I was kinda of demotivated to watch this movie. Fortunately I did watch it and it was a GOOD Movie(with a capital M). It wasn\\'t hard to watch at all and it kept my attention throughout.\\nI highly recommended it. This movie wasn\\'t bad, slow but interesting. But the end??? So rushed. It spoiled the whole movie, what happened? How? Why? Tye Sheridan really impressed me with his portrayal of a man with Asperger\\'s. He is very convincing, from the lack of eye contact to his mannerisms. The story itself is a little slow, and lacks an emotional climax. I have no idea why I watched this till the end when it was annoying me within 5 minutes. Tye Sheridan plays a night clerk with Aspergers in a motel. I don\\'t know anyone with this affliction, but I do know his character was driving me nuts and his acting came across as forced and phony. The story is preposterous, I thought this was suppose to be a thriller, but it\\'s just an extremely boring and drawn out drama about him trying to cope and in a back story there is a murder. It\\'s just nonsense, with uninspired performances and dialogue, scenes that go on so long you\\'ll be nodding off and towards the end what was boring became confusing and ridiculous, in fact I had no idea what was going on. Ana De Armas is very beautiful but she needs to avoid Cr*p like this if she wants a long term career. This is complete Hollywood made for television garbage using a real mental condition to wring some sympathy from a bad script with a ludicrous plot. What were any of these people thinking? How did anyone show up on the second day of filming? I loved every minute of this movie.. The acting were superb especially Tye Sheridan\\'s.. the brief romance between Ana De Armas\\'s and Tye at the swimming pool was really heartwarming. and lastly I didnt see the ending coming. It fooled me alright. Artsy was defeated by Slow & Dismal! The Actors did their part but the writers and editors failed tremendously. Slow movie but the acting was alright. The two lead actors were average but did well for a movie with a dull script Love this movie. Great acring, great place. Worth a watch. I really tried to like it but the more time passed in the movie the worst it got. The only quality of the movie was the acting of the male lead. The female lead was actually a pretty bad in my opinion. Her acting was not believable and came off a bit annoying. The script was simply terrible and all over the place. And the worst part was that almost everything about this movie was predictable. A boring and badly written movie. I only commend Tye Sheridan and John Leguzamo(detective) in all of this. Yes, that statement made you think more and had more twists and turns than this whole movie. At least you have a 50/50 chance of having some fun when you see a balloon knot as compared to the 100% crap you get with this thing. Only this slower than this movie a one legged giraffe on a skateboard. Tye Sheridan\\'s acting was exceptionally excellent \"EE\"!! Brilliant mate. Top work, I understand Tye most likely studied his art in depth and it shows here. Plus John Leguizamo! Wow you owned the role and so lovely that you were a good rough cop. Who also respected the disorders or? Orders of autism:-)\\nThank you guys for making this great acting with great writing and directing!\\nA must watch Good cast and nice narrative buildup, slowly brewing. Works fine. Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982\\'s Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today\\'s audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.\\nThe Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph. Wow this was terrible and cliched.Really, if you have no ideas, reason or script just.skip.it.I woke up long enough to feel sorry for a suffering dog, but that is about it. Where is the action? Where is the crescendo? Where is the meaning??? What? Replicants can now give birth? So they are not replicants anymore and can be considered bona fide humans so what is the morale of all of this?? Pros: Beautiful to look at Beautiful women Cool technology Cons: SlowNothing is resolved Boring script, dialogue and lines Typical sequel (a shadow of its prequel) They really should become more judicious in picking which movies need a sequel and if they do that 90% of sequels will never come to be and the focus will shift towards developing new ideas. For film fanatics like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is a great film for people to see, regardless if they\\'ve witnessed the original or not. On the other hand, if you\\'ve never seen the original Blade Runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I\\'d have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. It\\'s very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that\\'s exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why Blade Runner 2049 is a must see as soon as possible. Before dropping you into this world with Ryan Gosling\\'s character, there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past, but even though that information is given to you, your experience just won\\'t be the same without having viewed the first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it. Set out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story, Ryan Gosling\\'s character (who will remain nameless for the sake of this review) uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past, inevitably involving Rick Deckard. Quite honestly, that\\'s the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience, so let\\'s get technical. If not for anything else, Blade Runner 2049 benefits from some of the best cinematography I\\'ve laid my eyes on in years. From the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects, to the mind- blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department, I have nothing but praise for this film. Whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience, the visuals alone should have you applauding, due to their incredibly detailed nature. I personally found the overall film to be magnificent, but when certain scenes were dialogue-free and asking you to gasp at the imagery, that\\'s exactly what I was doing, as I feel many audiences members will. Again, without giving anything away, once Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) enters the picture, the way both films sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion. It does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past, as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process. With a terrifically restrained performance by Ryan Gosling, you\\'ll find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall, as he uncovers these mysteries. With the addition of Harrison Ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances, as well as Ana de Armas in a role that really took me by surprise, this film was casted to the nines from beginning to end. Some may complain about Jared Leto and Dave Bautista not being included as much, but I felt as though the served the story quite nicely. In the end, this movie aims to impress Sci-Fi fans across the world, but I feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made, are those who\\'ve had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is 1982\\'s Blade Runner. I don\\'t say this about films very often, especially when talking about sequels, but I haven\\'t been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time. This is definitely a superior film than the original, it\\'s one of the best films of 2017, and I\\'ll be revisiting it very soon. Blade Runner 2049 is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across the world, and every bit of it is deserved. Aside from being very long, this is pretty much a perfect film if you don\\'t try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that aren\\'t blatantly answered. If you know what type of film you\\'re in for, or you\\'ve at least seen the original and enjoyed it, I can\\'t recommend this movie enough. Just slo-mo \\'acting\\' and movements with insider jokes to pretend they are clever.\\nCould someone point out why this Blade Runner and this blade runner exist? No? Didn\\'t think so.\\nPS: compare the music with this accounting ledger balance sheet line item with Vangelis\\' original.\\n2 stars for the poor and cute dog.Over and out. Blade Runner 2049 of course came with its own expectations and a bar that was set quite high. I was drawn in by the promise of that universe, the graphics and the giant holographic woman and was not disappointed. The CGI and the building, as well as the beautiful women were what I expected. I wish I had a \\'wife\\' that pretty.Unfortunately, again the bar was set high, but this film did not deliver. There are too many loose ends and the film does not give the audience a conclusion. The major surprise regarding replicants and what they can do is also a bridge too far. I do agree that the film is slow, which coupled with the lack of a conclusion brings my rating down.6/10 Not only it went against the prequel\\'s story, but also it left the door open for another film. Nothing happens in this after all. All they did is take our money, put us to sleep very likely and tell us to come back and give them more money for the inevitable sequel/franchise/universe/vomit.Here are things hinted at but not resolved: dystopia, army, child birth, successor, corporate corruption and of course lovers\\' relationship.Don\\'t give it your money. Three stars for the girlfriend\\'s eyes, hair, thighs and home cooking. Mainly because I fell asleep. Why is this film so boring? I mean aside from a menage a trois scene where the girlfriends are actually worth looking at everything else not only transpired so slowly it made little sense as well.Why anything on screen is happening boggles the mind. Ask yourself why any of the narrative is of consequence and there is a blank page as an answer. That is saying much in a film that tries to be profound. The rest: 0 starsBoringWell it is a sequel after all, what did I expect?Anyway, this makes no sense, the girl is hot but I do not understand the point of the film when the replicants are not replicants anymore. Let me describe the sequence of Blade Runner 2049 for youHere goes:Enter the cinema with an overpriced orange juice that is mandatory because in the last couple of years Hollywood has decided it is artsy and de rigueur to make films longer than 2 hours. The lights dim and commercials kick in for 10 minutes. A game for pre-teens wasting daddy\\'s money on mobile phones and plans kicks in. 2 minutes of endorsements for GM trucks (with some guy whose tone is so macho I roll my eyes) follows. Then there is a reminder to get the right debit card to be hip and in. Then the film follows for a whopping 3 hours almost. You would think that there was a lot happening and we were kept excited. Alas, the only thing that kept me awake was the very periodical appearance of a beautiful eye candy whether real, hologram or laser show version that would keep things exciting.If it were not for the sexy and lovable women Blade Runner 2049 was inane. Yes, inane. Apparently, not every film needs a sequel, a lesson Hollywood didn\\'t learn from Hangover.The script was so corny and the words so elementary one would be excused for thinking this is a practical joke. Head of police, yes head of police is told a big lie by a contractor, head of police believes it and all is good. No double checking, no verifying, no details asked no proof required. it is a matter of life and death for the order of the world and, of OK, let\\'s keep rolling guys. The ending was also a joke. A vehicle is drowning and the hero is being drowned but in the last second kills the bad gal and swims back to the vehicle to mount a rescue (for the sequels that will follow). Replicants can have and make babies, but how? Oh well, watch the prequel Blade Runner Rogue Uno, which is coming out in 2020.At that point all I wanted in life was to buy my own Joi and Luv and go back home. .... is only second to American remakes of foreign movies. When Hollywood remakes international movies my house begins to stink.With that said, sequels are a close second and this so-called Blade Runner shows why. In other words, Blade Runner 2049 is contradictory (pretty holographic wife cooking meals and showing skin... yeah earth sucks now, take that off worlders... yeah what a hell hole) and just a cash cow. Ridley Scott has finally ran out of different video versions of the original to release and people are sick of the alien prequels and sequels he kept pushing out (they all sucked) and so he\\'s back here.Get some integrity. My goodness how can you expect an audience to sit through three hours of mind numbing slow-mo contradictory conversations that make no sense and expect people to pay for the privilege.I guess, we should have known better since it is a sequel.All that rescued this film was several hard body, super thin, flaunting babes. Yup, those ashamed of the human body, nature and heterosexuality should stay away too. Otherwise, without the chicks the film would be a complete bust. The Force Awakens (2015) + Mr Sandman (the Lullaby 1954) = Blade Runner 2049. I still was bored. I am referring to the thin eye candies. The girlfriend and hooker were positively femininely beautiful and worth the price, but this is not a good movie. Outside the slender and flaunting body of the eye candies it quickly descends to boredom. I just kept rewinding to check out the actresses. Otherwise, zzzz First they make a film to put us to sleep. It is boring, slow, tedious and quite sleep-inducing. We fall asleep and catch up on some much needed rest.Then the \\'music\\' is a series of farts and tears and explosions and keeps waking me up. Look either get a soundtrack with music or skip it. What is with all the hi tech special effects\\' sounds instead of music??? I read that Ridley Scott likes to produce more of these. Please do not!\\nTerrible!It was so boring. I cannot believe they thought anyone would get through this overlong movie in a dark environment like a cinema. Perhaps that is why they had the \\'soundtrack\\' which was mostly explosive rip, tears and screeches instead of music to wake us up.I did enjoy the dog, the pretty girlfriend and the prostitute. Involving a couple of flaunting babies, but otherwise this film is stupid. Do you remember the criticism of the prequel where Rachel and Deckard ride into the sunset on a glorious road amidst beautiful nature? Right. Here too you can live in opulance in a casino and drink free whiskey and even have your own cute dog, etc.\\nSnore. What can I tell you? Sequels. The set design is fantastic, the girls are sexxxy and I love dogs. The poor dog!Is it trendy in Hollywood to not employ editors and have the film go on and on and on and on? What\\'s more it is a sequel. More about making money than creating a story. .. to come to think this is a good movie.The pretty women and fantasy are welcome and certainly a pleasant rarity in these anti-human body times, but this sequel (yup the problem right there) is boring and should not exist.It is forced, too long and the contrast to its prequel damning. Hollywood needs to stop making these meaningless sequels. They are for losers and only made for cash hoarding because if Hollywood was lacking cash it would not pay all these no-talents in the millions. At least this wasn\\'t anti-woman and anti-female and the women were hot and thin.\\nThey could have easily done a modern film where all the women are in baggy jump suits and obese and expect us to love it but at least they didn\\'t hate on slender and attractive women. That\\'s something these days.Of course it was a sequel and it was stupid and made little sense. I also have to say it is time for Ford to retire. Do you know why this is the worst sequel ever (aside from the crappy sequels from Disney)?\\nNot only it is too over-long and boring it also makes it beautiful prequel become less attractive to the viewers. That is criminal. Sure, the keywords on IMDB point out the chicks are pretty but that is not enough justification for more sequels or remakes.Hollywood, not every film needs a sequel. STOP. Blade Runner 2049 is not a good film, but it is not a complete disaster. A story that did not need telling and logically failed, an overlong and slow moving narrative and a massacre that makes no sense any longer were countered by original visuals and beautiful women. I will go with a rating of 4/10.The problems with this film is that it has sequeltitis. They came up with it because they needed to make money from a sequel and have no original ideas.\\nThe massacred are peaceful and are farming. Why do it then? The story moves so slowly that the 3 hours seem like 6. The acting is not good, but moderna ctors cannot touch older ones so that is par for the course. When in the original the performance by the chief of police, his goon, the industrialist and the eye maker would rivet and excite or the strong personality of the replicants would make the blood boil here it is a paint by the number series of appearances.With that said the futuristic society is fun to watch. Even more fun is Ana de Armas, the sexy and delicious hooker and even the legs of the Chief (who is old so has short hair unfortunately). These babes add to the vista and architecture that is most pleasing to the eye in this sequel. What was the point of this film? It was not entertaining, it was slow and it was sleep-inducing so there must be a plot or morality instead, right? Wrong.\\nThey are retiring peaceful and oppressed replicants while at the same time making even more.\\nConfused yet?YupLet me give you the reason why they needed this film. Hollywood needs sequels like Donald Trump needs porn stars with STD. Period. It is a disease and addiction for the weak.\\nPS: I asked my wife if she is into a menage a trois for us and said said no, but I know she was watching with interest so at least this film gave us an opening. I am leaving you. We are done. Your endless sequels and franchise movies are boring and uninspired. Frankly, forgive my crudeness, they all suck.\\nYou think bringing a couple of sexy babes into our lives will save our marriage. They do not. I watch the chicks, but I still know that you are boring and the fire and passion are gone.\\nTake care. After being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians - most notably \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Rocketman\" and \"Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story\" - it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict (though desirable) biographical approach. That is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous; I came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of The Beatles, and their music, through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all. Quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing.On another level, the film made a satire of the modern music industry. It revealed how the apparent \"solo\" artists are far from their titles; with huge teams of people pushing them in a preferred, and more commercial, creative direction, taking the musicians\\' creative power. This was done in a humorous light (as most themes are presented in the film). The romantic aspect of the film is evident from the beginning and is a dominant aspect of the story, possibly shifting the focus of the piece a little too much. However, it still helps provides a satisfying ending.The film pays a great amount of respect in a fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts. Refreshingly original and entertaining. The story flows and the characters are relatable and well developed. Not what I expected from the trailer but I liked it better than what I expected. So nice to see someone take a chance on an original story. The original premise of the movie was fantastic - only one man knows that The Beatles ever existed and brings their music to the world.It could have been really really great. Unfortunately the idea was under developed, it felt as if the film\\'s makers weren\\'t quite sure what to do with it.It ended up being \"nice\" and \"sweet\" when it could have been brilliant. I went into this wondering if they were going to explain the whole premise with it being a dream or such? Was he going to get caught and crucified for it? Was he going to get the girl, lose the girl? So many movies are fixated on realism and difficulties and negativity. Yes, he faces several difficulties. But, the movie is light and beautiful with fantastic music. If I want realism, I watch a documentary. This is what I go to the movies for. Really well done! There are some movies that when released simply don\\'t need a big marketing campaign. Just a few words of description of the plot are enough to put it on your \"must see\" list: \"A struggling musician has a cycling accident during a freak global blackout and wakes to a world where noone other than him remembers the Beatles or any of their songs.\" When I heard this I said to myself \"yes, Yes, YES\"! But would it live up to my expectations?This is a Richard Curtis penned film, and that\\'s immediately enough to put a tranche of movie-goers off. All his movies have an accent on the uplifting, the positive and/or the whimsical, and I can understand why that winds some people up. If \"Richard-Curtissy\" was an adjective, and I think it should be, many of these films can be so classified.Here, although again very Richard-Curtissy, I think he gets the mixture JUST RIGHT.... \"Yesterday\", for me, was a complete joy from beginning to end.I imagine Curtis getting this story from a rowdy dinner party round his gaff. He asks his guests, over the third bottle of dessert wine, to play a wild and fantastical \"what if\" game (in pursuit of the \"very good\" spare brownie of course). At this particular event, I guess it was co-story-author Jack Barth (in his movie-writing debut) that made the successful attempt to \"hog the brownie\". For the premise of \"Yesterday\" is quite brilliant, whilst at the same time being utterly bonkers too!That being said, the story is not completely original. I thought there were many similarities to the Ricky Gervais vehicle of 2009, \"The Invention of Lying\", where Gervais alone finds he suddenly has the ability to tell lies, and finds ill-gotten fortune and fame as a result. Much like that earlier film, much of the joy here is in the recognition of the gift given and the dawning realisation of what this might actually mean to him. As such, I found the first half of the film a lot more enjoyable than the second.The conundrum facing Jack is to remeber all of the Beatles songs and their lyrics (without having Google as a reference), and much fun is had with him stumbling into situations that suddenly remind him of a new track or a particular snatch of lyric.There is of course an obvious explanation for the whacky storyline, since the hero has received a potentially serious head injury. But would the film go there? (No spoilers here).Himesh Patel is from TV\\'s \"Eastenders\" but here makes his movie debut. He is perfectly cast as Jack Malik: in the film, he\\'s a name about to rise from utter obscurity as a Lowestoft retail assistant to global superstardom. Patel is charming and believable as he squirms with his conscience. A surprising and touching beach scene in the final reel of the film is exquisitely acted.The ever-watchable and utterly gorgeous Lily James here goes brunette: she was actually unrecognisable to me from both the trailer and the poster! Here she makes a very believable high-school teacher with a side-line in management and roadie-ing.I found Ed Sheeran\\'s cameo in \"Bridget Jones Baby\" to be excruciating! But here, in what is quite an extensive part, he is much, much better. I think he\\'s been getting lessons.One of the slight disappointments with the film is that it is a Danny Boyle film that doesn\\'t FEEL like a Danny Boyle film. Aside from some inventive on-screen titles, I didn\\'t detect much of the stylisation that I would expect from one of his films. Yes, there are occasional flashes of genius - for example, the scenes where Malik is desperately trying to remember the lyrics of Eleanor Rigby, and those of him watching, big screen, his own social-media led rise to super stardom. But otherwise, the visuals and storyline are pretty linear in nature.Although there are cloyingly gooey bits of this film, the element that weaves it all together - such that \"all is forgiven\" in my book - is the magical music and lyrics of McCartney, Lennon and Harrison.Was there a better year to be born that 1961? (Well, possibly the mid- to late- 50\\'s so you were old enough to remember more of it). But although only a child aged between two and nine during their album releases, I felt the benefit of three older siblings who WERE able to fully embrace Beatlemania. And the film delights with its modern day recreations of the classic tracks and, as already mentioned, Himesh Patel belts them out wonderfully (especially, I thought, with \"Help!\").I can\\'t not give this one 10 stars. I simply loved it, and can\\'t wait for its general release (in the UK, on June 28th 2019) so I can go and love it all over again. Is it technically a 10-star film? Possibly not, but sometimes you just have to go with the way a film makes you feel, not just as you walk, whistling, out of the cinema but for the whole of the next 48 hours and (I suspect) longer. In summary, he loves it. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeeaaaaaah\".(This is an edited version. The full graphical review is available on \"One Mann\\'s Movies\" on t\\'internet or Facebook. Please consider checking it out. Thanks!) It was a great idea and in some ways the film made the vision work. I just don\\'t think they did enough with it though and instead fell back into the traditional love story formula. The music helped carry a lot of it through (unsurprisingly). What they missed was it wasn\\'t necessarily the songs themselves but the era in which they came out and the meaning of the time. Movie just presented it as almost instant stardom if today\\'s world heard the songs which lets be honest today\\'s generation wouldn\\'t understand half of it. It didn\\'t really present a clear vision of \"why\" which I was looking for towards the end to help tie things up. Lights go off on the planet he takes a bump on the head then the Beatles never existed? Alternate universe? Dream? Thought there would\\'ve been something more there. There were a few things that bothered me with the story that the movie made it seem like they were pieces to the puzzle but then never did anything with them. First is through the film he also finds out other things don\\'t exist as well such as coke, cigarettes, the band oasis, and Harry Potter. It seemed like these things were going to connect into the story and why the Beatles music isn\\'t present but they just left it there and he kind of says \"oh well\" and nothing comes of it. The second was he finds out there are two others that also know the Beatles music and again seems like this should be a big part of the story to tie things together as to a bit of \"why\" but they just have a conversation about it she gives him an address and then that\\'s it. His conversation with what I think is supposed to be John Lennon didn\\'t make sense either. Does that mean the other 4 exist? Did they never meet to make music? Just all added up to a great idea that worked early in the film but didn\\'t follow through properly. All my opinion of course Just left the TriBeCa Film Festival where the film premiered, and I have to say, the film was superb. Everyone in the film is outstanding and Danny Boyle does a brilliant job handling some of the greatest songs ever written. Speaking of that, The Beatles legacy will forever live on with this film. YesterdaySo much of this movie was charming, brilliantly acted, and inventive, however somewhere around the middle of the movie, (the missing the train scene) it just turned into a big farce. The plot just became unbelievable, it also turned corny and over-sentimental. Of course I accept the whole movie was built on supernatural premise but what follows must hang together and keep the audience rooting for our hero.What was good:1, I loved the music, I think this made the movie.2, Jack Malik, played by Himesh Patel, did a fine job, he has mastered irony and deadpan, we were all wanted this antihero to have his dream.What was challenging;1, the plot was either so corny or so contrived, some plot twists were just unnecessary and added nothing.2, Elle, played by Lily James, lost our sympathy, she was presented as needy and pathetic and just as the culmination of him achieving \"their\" dream, she tries to make him choose between his dream and her.3, The conclusion was unsatisfactory, he wanted to be a musician and was fabulous at it, he ended up a teacher, big mistake.Overall, the was an overly contrived feel good movie, I enjoyed whilst I was watching it, but feel cheated and unsatisfied at the end. Saw it at my cinema in Lovran, Croatia just a few hours ago, so it\\'s still pretty \"fresh\" while I\\'m writing this.\\nThe whole idea is great, haven\\'t seen those yet in mainstream cinema. The plot is pretty much straight-forward, with likeable characters, great music (of course) and when the movie was over, it left me with good feeling and a smile on my face still singing Hey Jude.All actors are really good, but Lily James is so adorable in this movie! She shines in her character and steals every scene she is in. Liked her the most (obviously).Take your girlfriend/boyfriend/friends/family to see this rom-com fantasy music comedy in cinema on a big screen, and even if you won\\'t like the movie, you will sing Beatles songs after and feel good about it (guaranteed)! What a great premise totally wasted by a mediocre screenplay.\\nActing is good, but everything else falls flat. Sheeran\\'s participation doesn\\'t really make any sense. He should\\'ve been just a cameo...All in all, a big disappointment. There were three main reasons really in seeing \\'Yesterday\\'. The alternative world scenario sounded truly fascinating, one of the most fascinating concepts in recent years to me and a refreshing change from the remakes and sequels constantly made today. Like to love a lot of Danny Boyle\\'s previous films and find him a talented director. The Beatles are not all time favourites but do appreciate him highly, understand their influence in music and like a lot of their songs a lot.While it could have done more with its concept, \\'Yesterday\\' turned out to still be entertaining and charming that put me and my sister in an uplifting mood leaving the cinema. Had not had an easy day, or week even, up to seeing the film, so \\'Yesterday\\' was a much needed and appreciated antidote. As far as films released in 2019 go, it is neither one of the best or worst in a hit and miss year and somewhere around solid middle if having to rank.\\'Yesterday\\' is a slick looking film, not exemplary but never cheap. Lily James looks great and the camera clearly loves her. The music of course is fantastic, it is The Beatles after all, with some of their greatest hits exuberantly performed, making one want to sing along regardless of whether they know all the words or not. \"Hey Jude\" is one of the most memorable examples. The script balances amusing comedy and never over-sentimental drama without making it too cartoonish or mawkish (well mostly).Story-wise, \\'Yesterday\\' captures the feel-good spirit affectionately and the portrayal of the music industry was fun and didn\\'t get over the top. The John Lennon bit is a highlight. Boyle has done better and more inspired direction, but still directs at a crisp pace and balances things quite well. The performances are good, a truly charming James coming off best. Himesh Patel has come on a long way since \\'EastEnders\\' while Kate McKinnon is riotous in the manager role.On the other viewpoint, the concept was so fascinating and while it is always engaging the story is predictable and a bit too ordinary. Especially the final third, which is pretty much exactly as one would expect.Ed Sheeran\\'s \"extended cameo\" for my tastes was rather puzzling and didn\\'t seem to gel with everything else.All that aside, it was an enjoyable film on the whole and worth seeing. 7/10 Yesterday is pure cinematic fluff with a lightning-bolt of an idea. In moments, those substance-less joys earn their cuteness. But, as with writer Richard Curtis\\'s other films (About Time), there\\'s a unique ethical question underscoring the surface: what rights does an artist have over a creation they didn\\'t create? Should we be honest about \"reality\" when that reality isn\\'t reality? Confused? Don\\'t worry; that complexity is all but completely brushed under the rug here, opting instead for cheap explanations and corny romance.\\nBecause of unimportant and uninteresting reasons, an aspiring musician (Patel) discovers he is the only person in the world who remembers The Beatles. Patel is great in the lead; with impeccable timing and effortless charm, he manages to steal all these classic songs without losing our sympathy. He\\'s supported by a handful of genuinely funny and sweet moments: jokes at the expense of Oasis and Ed Sheeran, the reveals of other erased cultural touchstones (Coca-Cola, Harry Potter, etc), even a surprisingly moving reveal of others who remember the past. Unfortunately, the story doesn\\'t do much to help. Lazy storytelling shortcuts are taken at every turn, making a fantastical concept even more difficult to believe.\\nCurtis is usually quite adept with this type of rom-dramedy, but he\\'s not at the helm here. Boyle is, and he\\'s known for his hyper-stylized direction, which proves problematic. Where he spends time working on montages of ridiculous metaphorical storytelling devices, he should be fleshing out character motivations and ethical conundrums. Yesterday makes me glad we live in a reality with The Beatles, so we can ignore this movie and stay home to listen to Abbey Road. Hey, there is a moment in every one\\'s life when you need a break, and you need to remember that life can be simple, can be romantic, can be wistful, can be about remembering what matters and why.\\nThis movie is not about fixing the world or fixing the audience, it is about bringing a smile to your face while providing a special pleasure that we did not know we were missing out on: the one that allow us to revel in the sound, poetry and consciousness of one of the most iconic band the music scene has known.\\nI enjoyed the movie with my kid, who used to sing the Beatles when she was a toddler and that turned into a teenager not particularly interested in the music her parent enjoyed, who had as much a blast as I did during the movie.\\nThe acting rand true, the emotion were genuine and the music was a blast, there is absolutely no reason to miss out on this cool concept and movie. To cut a long story short, with a film directed by Danny Boyle and based on a legendary band such as The Beatles, I was expecting significantly better, although the movie is definitely not bad. The love story between Jack Malik and Ellie Appleton is excellently interpreted by Himesh Patel and the gorgeous Lily James, while Kate McKinnon vervely interprets a sickening impresario. But the movie is globally disappointing with a certain flatness and a script suffering from a blatant lack of originality: the « Twilight Zone » effect has been seen again and again so many times. In fact, by being slightly in bad faith, the film Yesterday (2019) can almost be reduced to the Beatles songs. I am fully aware of the exaggeration, but allow me to moan and groan: I\\'m slightly disappointed with such a banal rom com about The Beatles, a stuff of legend across all periods of time. I liked it. It was a refreshing change from the blockbuster superhero genre that is choking society.\\nJack\\'s struggle with the dishonesty was obvious throughout the film. The music was superb. Ed Sheeran\\'s portrayal of himself was super cute.\\nI was a little worried the writer would take it over the top and Ed would decide Jack was better than he and decide to stop making music. I am very glad they didn\\'t go there with the story.\\nJack coming clean near the end and the way he did it, was a good ending for me.\\nAlso the fact that The Beatles were not the only thing/person to disappear during the blackout was a fun touch.\\nAll in all, It was an emotional, fun, twist of a movie. This film is an absolutely beautiful story that depicts the Beatles\\' success in such a unique and brilliant way.Himesh Patel (Jack Malik) has an incredible voice and is absolutely perfect for his role. Lily James (Ellie Appleton) is also the perfect person for her role as she depicts a very sweet school teacher who has been desperate for Jack to love him since they met. This is also why the romantic element in this film is flawless and heartwarming, particularly towards the end of the film.The film is also very funny and all the cast do an excellent job of making the audience laugh. Ed Sheeran (playing himself) is hilarious and I am very glad that he agreed to be a part of this film.Do you enjoy the Beatles and their songs? Comedy? Romance? Fantasy? If you enjoy any of these things, I guarantee you will love this film and I recommend you see it as soon as possible! What a sweet, wonderful film. Even if you didn\\'t grow up with The Beatles music like I did, you should have a great appreciation for this film. Whoever came up with the idea is a genius. The acting is wonderful, the direction seems to be having as much fun as the actors are, the music is, well, mostly The Beatles, but with new and fun arrangements that pay so much honor to the originals. And with the sweet little twists, this movie does have a simple, but touching moral. Plus you\\'ve got Kate McKinnon, who can read a phone book and be amazing (you kids under 35 won\\'t know what a phone book is).If you need two hours to forget about all the bad things in this world or in your life and to just feel happy, go see this movie! After Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman. Yesterday is the next movie based on the classic song sang by a classic musicians. But unlike Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman which are biography movies. Yesterday is a fantasy comedy movie which is a different take from the previous two. Did the movie deliver or did the movie disappoint. After seeing the first trailer back in February I was very interested in the its unique concept of the movie.The plot for the movie centers around Jack Malek who is a struggling musician until he had a bus crash while power was turned off about 12 seconds he then finds out that he is the only person who knows the songs of the Beatles.The movie delivered on its premised in a lot of levels. The performances by Himesh Patel and Lily James was excellent they had great chemistry and you can feel their friendship grew throughout the movie. I thought Ed Sheeran wasn\\'t that bad in the movie and he was a lot better than I expecting considering that most real life musicians acting was mostly bad. The movie featured lots of classic Beatles which was great even though Let It Be was on briefly I was expecting a full version of the record in the movie. But that didn\\'t ruin the whole movie. The ending of movie was very moving and emotional don\\'t going to say anything about the ending but it was lovely ending.Overall the movie was excellent it was original but unlike a lot of original movies that has a great premise but didn\\'t deliver this movie does deliver with great performances and a wonderful ending this movie is to enjoy by everyone who loves the the Beatles or just want to have a great fun time at the cinema. I highly recommend it. I\\'m no film buff. This ticked all my boxes. Great music, and every emotion covered. It\\'s not deep but in its own way it digs deeper than most. Love, love love it! Of course the film is packaged within the most basic, cliched even, romcom format. Childhood sweethearts never expressed love for each other, then something happens, their relationship gets strained, until love wins and is declared publicly.This isn\\'t a whodunnit, you can guess the ending from the trailer. You will have seen countless films like this and you come to expect everything that happens to happen. Just as you expect a chorus after a verse in a Beatles song. Or any other pop song.But within that outer layer there is a very interesting subject that the film explores: what if we lost something that brings us all together? What if we didn\\'t have a shared cultural experience to which we all give the same meaning?When the blackout happens, the Beatles are not the only thing that disappears from public memory: Jack googles \"coke\" and the search engine - which is what gives Meaning these days - displays a picture of Pablo Escobar. So when Jack asks a waitress for coke, it is not a ubiquitous beverage that the woman thinks of.And so Jack finds himself with the opportunity to gain fame and riches by appropriating what had been a pillar of our post-war popular culture globally: the Beatles catalogue. Because the true premise of the film is this: everyone likes the Beatles. And Beatles songs therefore can be used by us all to communicate with each other.Soon though Jack finds that the music has lost its universal meaning for the people who now appreciate \"his\" music. He is confronted with the ruthless pragmatism of the music industry, all the while being isolated by his alien cultural baggage and climb to fame.So when he reunites with the only two other people unaffected by the blackout, he finds that meaning again, and the plot finally twists.This isn\\'t a film about the Beatles\\' music, it isn\\'t a documentary about their legacy - it\\'s a film about a world suddenly losing shared experience, about losing a \"consensus\" that brought us together.That\\'s why I thought the ending, the other part of the ending, the one I\\'m not going to spoil, was so uplifting and progressive. Go watch it. I liked it! I was twelve when the Beatles became famous so I grew up with them. More than once a tear threatened to roll down my cheek but I\\'m a simple lass so what the hell! I\\'m no big-arsed critic who is paid to be clever and differant. I thought the writing and the acting was spot on. As someone whose had a bit of success, I appreciated that a great deal. Very authentic I thought. But here\\'s the thing; about that cameo... I won\\'t say who it is but when it happened, my jaw hit the floor. Amazing! Well done. And so, so sad.\\nGreat film. I\\'ll definitely buy the DVD.\\nAs an aside, if we are supposed to write twenty lines at least in these reviews, how come some of these reviews only contain two lines? Danny Boyle is a director that I usually like, but unfortunately this film disappointed me. I thought it was very cliched and filled to the brim with tropes and bad, cringeworthy dialogue. I thought the acting was good, and the premise was interesting, but they don\\'t live up to the potential of that premise. Because rather than exploring the interesting questions that this premise entails like how the world, the music industry, and our understanding of music would change if The Beatles were never a thing, they instead just use this as a strange, needlessly complex way of telling a by the books romance. Overall I wouldn\\'t exactly recommend this film, and I was pretty disappointed. Sat with a big smile on my face the entire time. \"A world without The Beatles is a world that is infinitely worse\" Yesterday tells the story of Jack, an amateur musician who is trying to break into the industry with the help of his best friend Ellie, but when he gets hit by a truck riding his bike home one night, he wakes up in an alternate universe where several things have turned out to have never existed, but most importantly the Beatles and their songs. Jack decides to take advantage of this, and uses the Beatles\\' music to launch his career, becoming the most famous pop star in the world.That premise sounds great, and I was looking forward to a surreal comedy, but to be honest, it doesn\\'t quite live up to it, instead getting distracted by what the actual main plot turned out to be: a cliche romantic comedy with the childhood friend that is secretly in love with the protagonist, only for him to figure it out for himself later.The best moments of this film are to do with the central premise of the alternate universe, where Jack would reference something, only for the people around him to say \"what\\'s that?\" I mean, it\\'s the same joke in different words basically every time, but hey, the way they execute it is pretty good. There are also some decent satirical moments with Jack interacting with the music industry, personified by Jack\\'s manager, and an extended cameo by Ed Sheeran, who falls victim to some self-deprecating jokes, but overall seems to be the secondary \\'star\\' of the show besides the Beatles\\' music.Speaking of the Beatles, you\\'d be surprised by how little they actually contribute to the plot. For a film that is named after one of their more famous songs, you\\'d think that their music and impact to society would be more than just a plot device for the main character to achieve his success. There\\'s no real commentary as to why the Beatles music is so great, you\\'re just told, over and over again, that they\\'re the greatest band ever, and that a world without them ever existing would suck. Sure, that is something I would agree with, but the film doesn\\'t really add much of their own perspective to that side of the story, it just takes that idea as fact.The romance is decent, but cliche and overall unremarkable. Screenwriter Richard Curtist definitely knows how to write romances, having written several well regarded romcoms, like Love Actually and About Time, but I would say that Yesterday isn\\'t quite up to that standard. Same goes for Danny Boyle and the other films he directed compared to this. The direction isn\\'t bad, but it\\'s bland and doesn\\'t really add much to the story. There are some weird shots, like some weird dutch angles near the beginning of the story that seem out of place, but nothing else unusual or amazing about the camerawork either.I guess if you like romcoms and Beatles music, this movie will definitely be watchable, but for me, as a person who doesn\\'t actively seek out that genre, this film didn\\'t stand out to me in either direction, and overall I\\'m disappointed that they didn\\'t take full advantage of the great premise. Yesterday is so fun to watch, I loved every moment of it. So good to finally see a film that isn\\'t a remake or a sequel. Himesh Patel and Lily James were brilliant and relatable. I loved their chemistry.\\nLoved all the music obviously!! how can you not. The Beatles are the biggest selling band in the world, if they didn\\'t exist the world deservers to hear their music.\\nHowever above all loved the underlying message; success doesn\\'t also have to be about the money you make and tell the truth at every possible opportunity you get.I can\\'t wait for this film to be released on DVD so I can watch it again and again. If you go into this expecting a $100 million action blockbuster you will be dissapointed. What this film delivers is a solid crime drama with some gritty and tense action scenes.\\nA strong lead performance by Joel Kinnaman holds the story together and the film moves swiftly at a pace that never drags.\\nIf you want a film that gives you actual story over mindless hollywood CGI action, then give this one a chance. If I had read the critics I would have ignored this film.I read a good review in The Sunday Express and went to see the film and liked it a lot.I will give no plot spoilers but if you like tough but not dumb crime films you will like this one.\\nIt does not have the biggest budget or the biggest action sequences but it is a good film.The plot is fine but the film also benefits from good locations and a talented cast.See this if you get the chance I think you will be glad you did. I\\'ve never heard of this film, nor seen any trailers, so I wasn\\'t expecting much and decided to give it a go since there wasn\\'t anything I haven\\'t already seen to watch. Well, wow!I\\'m shocked at some of the negative reviews so far. It goes to show you that you can\\'t please everyone. It\\'s either too Hollywood-ish or not Hollywood enough lol.Here\\'s why I REALLY liked it; For starters, this is actor Andrea Di Stefano second ever attempt at directing and writing, and compared to some of the films that have come out lately - and from seasoned writer and directors, he nailed it. Was it flawless? No. But considering is wasn\\'t a big budget Hollywood production with seasoned filmmakers and with all lead cast being A-listers, but instead a British-made B-grade film with newb filmmakers, this was produced exceptionally well and is a winner imo.I found the story very realistic and un-Hollywood-ish, which is refreshing for a change. Sure this story has been done many times before, but this one felt authentic. The last time I saw this type of genre movie that surprised and impressed me, was Shot Caller.Casting was perfect, with all leads playing their respective roles on point, especially Joel Kinnaman who nailed his character.Cinematography was great, the score/sound was fitting, and the production/location sets authentic. My only critique would be the pacing needed picking up in some parts, and/or the 113 min run-time trimmed down at least 10-15 mins.Aside from that, this was one of the best B-grade films I\\'ve seen, with its unpredictable plot turn at every corner, excellent central performances, all packaged really well by an newbie filmmaker. It\\'s a solid 9/10 from me!To see any of my 1000+ ratings and 700+ reviews, click on my username. Great acting(wife could have been better), many intense moments and simple, believable script. All of us have seen at least one similar movie in our lifes so dont expect anything new as I do think this movie is just meant to make your heart pump faster. If you have seen the trailer this film does what it says on the tin. It is a decent cop/bad guy film that is a little different in its storyline.The film rattles along a decent pace and has some good scenes. There is some quite good suspense and action along the way as well.Where the film is let down is the ending is just so clear, aside from a tiny twist, from about half way through the film and even then, when it happens it\\'s quite a damp squib. There are also parts of the story that just don\\'t stack up, which is a shame as it has good potential. What a nice change to get away from the \\'typical\\' Holywood action flick and to get into a grittier, morally ambiguous, uncompromising drama. Rosamund Pike continues to prove what a great actor she is with a performance that echoes her character in Beirut. Joel Kinnaman gives a performance that is just as conflicted and compelling as Altered Carbon. Altogether a great cast that manages to build realistic characters. My only criticism of the script is the overly detailed explanation of fentanyl that Pike gives to her team on FBI agents - it\\'s the only point where you feel the film patronises the audience. Other than that, a thoroughly enjoyable movie. The Informer is an enjoyable and well made thriller, despite the generic plot and some predictable moments. Joel Kinnaman gives a great lead performance with good supporting performances from Common, Rosamund Pike, Clive Owen and Ana de Armas. It\\'s also well paced with an intense fight scene and tense gunfight in the third act. If you like action films with good story plus good acting this is the one for you. Personally I really enjoyed this movie and I would go again to it. An absorbing thrill ride of a crime thriller. Unlike some reviewers I actually found this well paced with enough twists to keep it interesting and a ruthless violent edge alongside the drama. Was tempted to even rate as a 9 until near the end but I just can\\'t stand open endings to these things no matter how minor unless we know there\\'ll be a sequel I just want to know how the story is resolved fully. Nevertheless one of the better thrillers of the year so far and well worth a watch. This is not normally my kind of movie but I quite enjoyed it. The characters all felt pretty realistic, the actors all did a decent job and the story was compelling.It did feel a bit slow at points and I think maybe a little careful trimming could have done the film some good but even so it keeps you engaged and doesnt leave itself too open to easy prediction as you watch.Worth a watch I would say. Started out kinda strong, but quickly fizzled out.\\nI was surprised to see such good actors in this mediocre film, except for Common- he can\\'t act himself out of a paper bag.In the end it was a disappointment. Great, absorbing thriller with good guys, bad guys and guys somewhere in the middle. Sicario 2 was the last one that I enjoyed as much as this. It was like reading an Elmore Leonard story but without the humour. I understand that the UK did a good job of standing in for New York. What a surprise because it did feel like the Big Apple. I liked the flow of the film. You did not always follow what was going on - I\\'m still not sure of the role played by the drugs in the tulips - but the scenes did not linger. The film was a little open-ended. If the make The Informer 2, I would buy a ticket for it. The informer\\n2019\\n15\\ndirector: Andrea De stefano\\nstarring: Joel Kinnamon,Rosamund pike,Ana de armas,Common,Clive own etcoverall rating 73/100When ex convict Pete coslow gets involved with a shooting of a NYPD cop. He has to go back to prison in order to stop a drug gang from getting away with there crimes. But the lifes of his wife and child is at risk and its up to officer wilcox ( rosamund pike) to help him be reunited with his family. The informer was a good thriller but a flawed film, but still thoroughly entertaining lets get into why this is.First of all the film did a fantastic job of delivering an incredibly tense tone. The film did a fantastic job with keeping you on the edge of your seat. in fact i think this is up there with the most tense and unsettling films of the year in my opinion. The film just put the audience through so many uncomfortable situations. and with the lack of soundtrack it really helped with the authenticity of the film. Whether it was being attacked in the prison or in my opinion the most uncomfortable scene when the main characters wife and child was being gagged and threatened. Also the violence and gore helped with the entertainment value of the film. But also added to the tense tone and impact of each scene with a heads up some very gory things that were borderline 18 rating in my opinion.however my first issue is the slow pacing in the first half of the film. In my opinion the first half of the film was very slow and made me lose interest a few times. There was just a lot of filler conversations and standing around that left me needing something to spice the film up and make it more entertaining. But luckily they more then redeemed themselves in the second half of the film where it had a absolutely fantastic final act. They really went all out in the last half of the film to make you care about all of the characters and to keep you on the edge of your seat. With all the action was non stop within the last 30/45 minutes of the film so this more then made up for the first half of the film.Next i think the informer had a good amount of emotional weight to it. The fact that Joel Kinnamons character. Just wanted to get to his family and the love he showed them really made his character more respected in my opinion. And you related to him a bit more because most people are close to there families so being away from them is hard so everyone could\\npassively relate to his emotional state with his wife and kid.Next i think they really portrayed the harsh reality of prison life really well. A lot of films with prisons in can be very tame with what they show maybe due to the age rating but this film. Showed the types of people the horrible conditions that prisoners rightly have to go through so this was just a nice touch to see. However i do have to say that the film was very stereotypical with what type if inhabitants take up prisons. I think having a lot of the prisoners black and to have it split by colour is fairly old fashioned and they should of picked a more diverse group of people.Now my final two positives would be the fantastic acting was Joel Kinnamon and Rosamund pike. Rosamund pike was fantastic in the cop role. She was clever and did not take no for a answer whilst also having a kind heart and a nag for doing the right thing. And joel Kinnamon showed great diversity in the film. His character had a great blend of intimidation,vulnerability and perseverance and despite maybe not agreeing with some of his actions largely he was a character that you could support.However i do have to end on my final two negatives. First of all there was next to no character development or depth to most of the characters. Most of the characters were very one dimensional. And Petes wife did next to nothing in the film apart from being Petes motivation she was just a damsel in distress which was a shame considering the films of today with strong female characters. And finally there was some incredibly dislikable characters. Some of joels workmates who killed policemen and threatened his wife and kid were just sick and really made you not like there characters. I know this was the goal but for whatever reason something was off about some of the characters that really made you question the reasoning for them being there in the script.Overall the informer is a thoroughly entertaining and tense thriller with excellent acting. But is narratively flawed and could used with more developed and likeable characters. Joel Kinnaman is about the only thing holding this together. He\\'s an excellent actor and if you like him, this is worth watching. the movie is at times suspenseful but Hollywood seems to have given up on creating anything even slightly realistic. This movie is absurd and as it goes on, only gets more absurd. Towards the end I was actually laughing which isn\\'t a good sign when the movie is suppose to be a dramatic thriller. Worth a watch for Joel or if you have nothing else to watch. An unremarkable action thriller which isn\\'t particularly good or bad, just mediocre. It\\'s a bit boring at times, a bit too cliché at times and a bit implausible at times, but the story is gritty, the action scenes are well put together and the acting and characters are good, if a bit 1 dimensional. From the team that brought you Sicario comes another drug fuelled thriller with an amazing cast although set in the USA was filmed on location in the UK And is a UK production .Rosamund Pike plays \\'Emily Blunt\\' who was missing from Sicario 2 hence why that was so poor in comparison to the first .This one is based on the Polish mafia operating in NYC .Good tension , good story , great acting , stand out performance for me was the rapper Common as the NYPD detective with the street cred and look to make him a star in his own right .Central to the theme was family and the love of man for his wife and daughter and vice versa caught up in a web of crime he never deserved to be in .It\\'s one those films where the natural good guys and bad guys were twisted to make it more interestingAn enjoyable film with a little bit of violence but appropriate to the plot .Worth seeing .Pad.A 9/10 The premise of the film is decent but the execution is woeful. The story revolves around a military veteran involved in a drug ring being investigated by the FBI and the NYPD.Unfortunately virtually no time is spent on character introduction / development which makes it hard to care about any of the main protagonists. It\\'s just a series of improbable scenes which bear virtually no relation to each other. It doesn\\'t help that the audio mixing is terrible rendering much of the dialogue unintelligible.Joel Kinnaman does his best to portray a believable character, but Clive Owen is his usual wooden self. The other characters are completely forgettable.This could have been a decent film but the production and editing are dreadful and completely fail to tell a compelling or even coherent story. 2/10 and that\\'s being generous. This movie is a prime example of a terrible script screwing up a film.\\nThe acting is good and the directing okay but the story is so bad that you stop believing in the horrible plot, and they add a terrible finale that suspends any chance of belief that you just laugh and smirk that anyone thought this was a good idea of a story line. Plus the ending is so preposterous it feels like it is a tv series with a part 2 To be Continued.\\nAs if this piece of crap would have a sequel....\\nA 5 for the acting I really enjoyed it, it is one of the best movies I have seen for a long time. I did not watch the trailer and probably this was helpful. Sometimes trailers tells you everything in advance and according to a few comments this is whats happening here aswell. So don\\'t watch the trailer just go and enjoy this exciting movie with excellent actors. The InformerI really had high hopes for this movie and some things were good but overall so many aspects were just unsatisfactory and not thought through.What was good,1. The acting was first rate except perhaps for Joel Kinnaman who had the look but mumbled his way through a very stiff performance. Not a good start as in many ways the film rested on him.2, the cinematography was good and helped the tension and narrative flow.What was problematic1, too little variety in the movie, all we had was threat menace and betrayal2, the plot was labyrinthine, keep it simple.3, some of the turns were ridiculous, the NYPD cop arrived on his own to sort out a shoot out. The FBI had authority to act and then tried to conceal their actions. Criminal gangs rarely accept new members so the police try to turn existing members. The hostage scene was absurd as any idiot can spot a prisoner from a guard.4, the informer\\'s wife Sophia had the acting skills of a dead ant, the AB school of acting.5, the clash of theatre and method acting was so marked I laughed aloud.This was a boys movie with questionable acting and an absurd script, such a shame when you consider the calibre of actors involved. First found Joel Kinnaman in The Killing and have always really liked his acting. He is a very strong actor, and really enjoyed his role in this movie. It has some strong action sequences with the right amount of drama. Would recommend this film, for sure!! Great complex storyline but easy to follow. Very good film with superb acting. Confused why the rating isn\\'t higher yet. Pete (Joel Kinnaman ) is working an an informer for the FBI. Their goal is to take down \"The General\" and his drug operation. The plan had to be aborted when a cop was killed. The General wants Pete to go to prison and run a drug operation. The FBI thinks it is a good idea for him to go to prison and get the details. Things don\\'t go well while he is in prison either.This is a me-too crime film. Pike is better as a \"Gone\" girl than an FBI agent. The whole film had a me-too aspect to it.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. My heart pumping all the time ..\\nI need to see the next what will happen :( Enjoyable, entertaining thriller. Worth a watch. Good acting.'"
